 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which the company is exposed 

industry and market risks 

grainger’s business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the global outbreak of the coronavirus and its variants including the delta variant the omicron variant and any other variants that may emerge covid19 pandemic and may be adversely affected by other global outbreaks of pandemic disease 

any global outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on grainger’s business results of operations and financial condition including liquidity capital and financing resources 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and adversely affected grainger’s business including its business with customers and suppliers among other things grainger experienced customer disruptions including their ability or willingness to purchase products delays in making purchasing decisions and shifts in the types and quantities of products purchased these may recur during and beyond the covid19 pandemic grainger has also experienced and may continue to experience supply chain disruptions supplier inability to manufacture or deliver products to grainger or meet the unprecedented demand for pandemicrelated products rapid shifts in the type quantity or quality of products sold and higher product costs as a result of inflation 

additional effects from the covid19 pandemic on graingers business include adverse impacts on transportation including shipping delays and port disruptions increased shipping costs constraints on the availability of products and labor shortages which have impacted grainger’s ability to hire employees to fill all open positions the potential for further disruptions from the covid19 pandemic including closures of customer and supplier facilities remains furthermore graingers ability to collect its accounts receivable or receive product ordered from suppliers as customers and suppliers face higher liquidity and solvency risks and seek terms that are less favorable to grainger may adversely affect the company’s business these developments alone or in combination could materially adversely affect grainger’s future sales and results of operations 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic on grainger also include restrictions on grainger’s employees’ ability to visit customers and many of grainger’s employees’ ability to work in offices or at facilities as well as disruptions or temporary closures of the company’s facilities including distribution centers branches and support buildings some actions that grainger has taken in response to the covid19 pandemic including enabling remote working arrangements may increase grainger’s vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security which could damage grainger’s reputation and commercial relationships disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card association employees and others in addition grainger’s remote working arrangements have required the company to make adaptions to its controls and procedures that could impact their design or operating effectiveness the covid19 pandemic has also resulted in increased variable compensation wage rates and employee healthcare costs which adversely affect net earnings and grainger expects these trends to continue 

furthermore as a result of surges in demand and disruptions in supply chains including in asia and other locations from time to time the covid19 pandemic has resulted in shortages of certain ppe cleaning supplies and other products these shortages have impacted and in the future may continue to impact graingers ability to obtain or deliver inventory to customers on a timely basis or at all while grainger attempts to maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet quickly shifting customer demand patterns and supplier lead time requirements which may become extended due to the pandemic demand increase the company cannot be certain it will be able to accurately predict demand or lead times which might cause it to be unable to service customer demand or expose it to risks of product shortages this uncertainty caused grainger to acquire excess inventory which led to additional inventory carrying costs and inventory obsolescence and similar results may occur in the future for example in each of its first two fiscal quarters of 2021 as discussed in its corresponding quarterly reports on form 10q the company had pandemicrelated inventory adjustments in the us business part of hightouch solutions na on certain noncore skus which were selling below cost based on then current marketrelevant pricing 

from time to time product shortages have also required the company to procure products from new suppliers or through brokers with whom it has a limited or no prior relationship despite due diligence and product compliance protocols the products from these sources may not be delivered on a timely basis or at all or their quality may not be as represented all of which could cause grainger to incur costs including the expense of procuring alternate products or recalling or replacing products in addition to reputational and other adverse impacts to grainger’s business 

moreover global outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic have resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the economies of many countries resulting in a global or regional economic downturn or recession and supply chain challenges any such recession could result in a significant decline in access to products demand for the company’s products or limit grainger’s ability to access capital markets any of which could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the duration and ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time such factors and developments may include the geographic spread severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including whether there are periods of increased covid19 cases the further spread of the delta variant omicron variant or the emergence of other new or more contagious variants that may render vaccines ineffective or less effective disruption to grainger’s operations resulting from employee illnesses or any inability to attract retain or motivate employees the development availability and administration of effective treatment or vaccines and the willingness of individuals to receive a vaccine or otherwise comply with various mandates the extent and duration of the impact on the us or global economy including the pace and extent of recovery when the pandemic subsides and the actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak 

the company is a federal contractor and part of its workforce is covered by vaccine mandates imposed under president bidens september 9 2021 executive order complying with these requirements or other potential government mandates could disrupt the workforce and operations and impose additional compliance and other costs other requirements including health and safety measures such as social distancing and mask mandates andor travel bans import and export restrictions pricing mandates including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes and mandatory directives that certain products be allocated or provided to certain customers could also disrupt the company’s business and impose costs if the company is unable to respond to and manage the impact of these mandates requirement or events the company’s business and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected 

inflation could cause graingers operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in lower gross margins and lower net earnings 

market variables such as inflation of product costs labor rates and fuel freight and energy costs could increase potentially causing the company to be unable to manage its operating and administrative expenses in a way that would enable it to leverage its revenue growth into higher net earnings in addition graingers inability to pass on such increases in costs to customers in a timely manner or at all could cause graingers operating and administrative expenses to grow which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings 

disruptions in grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

the occurrence of one or more natural or human induced disasters including earthquakes storms hurricanes floods fires droughts tornados and other extreme weather pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the covid19 pandemic geopolitical events such as war civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of grainger’s logistics or supply chain network for example the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the operations of the company and its suppliers and customers customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed which has challenged graingers ability to anticipate andor procure product to maintain inventory levels to meet that demand these factors have resulted in higher outofstock inventory positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to the companys distribution centers branches or customers and similar results may occur in the future even when grainger is able to find alternate sources for certain products they may cost more or require the company to incur higher transportation costs which could adversely impact the companys profitability and financial condition any of these circumstances could impair graingers ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs penalties or damage to graingers reputation grainger’s ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance 

weakness in the economy market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of grainger’s customers could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

economic political and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity capital spending and demand for products and services of grainger’s customers many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty trade and tariff policies costs of goods sold currency exchange rates central bank interest rate fluctuations economic downturns recessions foreign competition offshoring of production oil and natural gas prices geopolitical developments labor shortages inflation natural or human induced disasters extreme weather outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic inflation deflation and a variety of other factors beyond grainger’s control any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases reduce production levels or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services 

any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger or impair the ability of grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on grainger’s selling prices and terms of sale accordingly a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in canada china japan mexico the uk the us or any other major world economy or a segment of any such economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

unexpected product shortages tariffs product cost increases and risks associated with grainger’s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 4900 suppliers located in various countries around the world not one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases 

disruptions in procuring sources of supply could occur due to factors beyond grainger’s control these factors could include economic downturns recessions outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic which from time to time has resulted in some shortages of ppe cleaning supplies and other products natural or human induced disasters extreme weather geopolitical unrest tariffs new tariffs or tariff increases trade issues and policies detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products labor problems or shortages experienced by grainger’s suppliers or others in the supply chain transportation availability staffing and cost shortage of raw materials unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply inflation and other factors any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in grainger’s product costs 

further grainger sources products from asia and other areas of the world this increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required and distances involved 

if grainger was unable to promptly replace sources of supply that become disrupted there could be adverse effects on inventory levels results of operations customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins 

some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives rare earth minerals or other materials or inputs required to manufacture ppe and other pandemicrelated products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market the recent global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies further changes in us trade policy including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs and retaliatory actions by us trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions the level of demand for graingers products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of raw materials and commodities including fuel fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services including as a result of outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic could affect transportation costs grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could reduce demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations 

grainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency while the financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of grainger’s subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars in addition grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the us dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger’s international subsidiaries primarily the canadian dollar euro pound sterling mexican peso renminbi and yen arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries sales to customers purchases from suppliers and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for grainger’s products and services 

grainger competes in a variety of ways including product assortment and availability services offered to customers pricing purchasing convenience and the overall experience grainger offers this includes the ease of use of grainger’s hightouch operations and delivery of products 

there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency 

to remain competitive the company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures downward pressure on sales prices changes in the volume of orders and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause grainger’s gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace these pressures could have a material effect on grainger’s sales and profitability if the company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs among other actions the company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

moreover grainger expects technological advancements and the increased use of ecommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace as a result grainger’s ability to effectively compete requires grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments grainger has increased and expects to continue to increase its investments in developing managing and implementing technology information systems software development and other capabilities to provide highquality service to its customers and simplify customer interactions developing managing or implementing new technology and innovations may result in unexpected costs and disruptions to operations may take longer than expected may increase the company’s vulnerability to cyber breaches attacks or intrusions and may not provide all anticipated benefits 

changes in customer base or product mix could cause changes in grainger’s revenue or gross margin or affect grainger’s competitive position 

from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer base and product mix that affect gross margin changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities competition and the increased use of ecommerce by grainger and its competitors for example as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company has sold higher volumes of lowermargin pandemicrelated products to larger lowermargin customers while nonpandemic sales have decreased 

in addition grainger has entered and may in the future continue to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations gpos that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices if the company is unable to enter into or sustain contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with gpos graingers results of operations could be adversely affected 

as customer base and product mix change over time grainger must identify new products product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs the inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into grainger’s existing mix could have a negative impact on future sales growth and grainger’s competitive position 

grainger’s common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines 

the trading prices and volumes of grainger’s common stock may be subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuations due to changes in economic political and market conditions the financial results and business strategies of grainger and its competitors changes in expectations as to grainger’s future financial or operating performance including estimates by securities analysts and investors the company’s failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements provided to the public speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or investment community or by groups of individual investors changes in capital structure share repurchase programs or dividend policies outbreak of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic and a number of other factors including those discussed in this item 1a these factors many of which are outside of grainger’s control could cause stock price and trading volume volatility or grainger’s stock price to decline volatility in the price of graingers securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

operational risks 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues 

the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or human induced disasters extreme weather power losses telecommunication failures user error third party actions such as malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks and cybersecurity breaches and other problems in addition from time to time grainger relies on the information technology it systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business 

if grainger’s systems or those of third parties on which grainger depends are damaged breached cease to function properly or are otherwise disrupted grainger may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interruptions in its business operations in the interim if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable grainger’s ability to operate its ecommerce platforms process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable disburse funds manage its supply chain monitor results of operations and process and store employee or customer data among other functions could be adversely affected any such interruption of grainger’s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations grainger has experienced these incidents in the past which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future there can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to grainger’s business operations or financial condition 

cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security could damage grainger’s reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues 

through grainger’s sales and ecommerce channels the company collects and stores personally identifiable confidential proprietary and other information from customers so that they may among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs register on grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company moreover grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business customers suppliers and employees and other sensitive matters 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in the company’s information systems if successful these attacks may expose grainger to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of business operations some actions that grainger has taken in response to the covid19 pandemic including enabling remote working arrangements may increase grainger’s vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security which could damage grainger’s reputation and commercial relationships disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card association employees and others 

graingers it infrastructure also includes products and services provided by suppliers vendors and other third parties and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of systems and proprietary or confidential information moreover from time to time grainger may share information with these third parties in connection with the products and services they provide to the business while grainger requires assurances that these third parties will protect confidential information there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised if successful those attempting to penetrate grainger’s or its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable credit card confidential proprietary or other sensitive customer supplier employee or business information or cause systems disruption while many of graingers agreements with these third parties include indemnification provisions the company may not be able to recover sufficiently or at all under such provisions to adequately offset any losses it may incur

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which the company is exposed 

grainger’s business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the global outbreak of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and may be adversely affected by other global outbreaks of pandemic disease 

any global outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on grainger’s business results of operations and financial condition including liquidity capital and financing resources 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and adversely affected grainger’s business including its business with customers and suppliers  grainger has experienced customer disruptions to their ability or willingness to purchase grainger products customer delays in making purchasing decisions shifts in the types and quantities of products purchased and in some cases diminished customer loyalty and retention rates these may continue to persist during and beyond the covid19 pandemic grainger has also experienced and may continue to experience supplier disruptions to their supply chains supplier inability to manufacture or sell products to grainger or meet the unprecedented demand for pandemicrelated products rapid shifts in the type quantity or quality of products sold and higher product costs additional effects on graingers business include disruptions or closures of customer and supplier facilities and their ability to continue as a going concern furthermore graingers ability to collect its accounts receivable or receive product ordered from suppliers as customers and suppliers face higher liquidity and solvency risks and seek terms that are less favorable to grainger may adversely affect the company’s business these developments alone or in combination could materially adversely affect grainger’s future sales and results of operations 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic on grainger also include restrictions on grainger’s employees’ ability to visit customers and many of grainger’s employees’ ability to work in offices or at facilities as well as disruptions or temporary closures of the company’s facilities including distribution centers branches and support buildings some actions that grainger has taken in response to the covid19 pandemic including enabling remote working arrangements may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security which could damage grainger’s reputation and commercial relationships disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card association employees and others in addition grainger’s remote working arrangements have required the company to make adaptions to its controls and procedures including to its financial reporting processes that could impact the design or operating effectiveness of such controls or procedures 

furthermore as result of surges in demand and disruptions in supply chains including in china and other locations the covid19 pandemic has resulted in shortages of certain ppe cleaning supplies and other products which may materially impact graingers ability to obtain or deliver inventory to customers on a timely basis or at all while grainger attempts to maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet quickly shifting customer demand patterns and supplier lead time requirements which may become extended due to the pandemic demand increase the company cannot be certain it will be able to accurately predict demand or lead times which might cause it to be unable to service customer demand or expose it to risks of product shortages or acquire excess inventory which could lead to additional inventory carrying costs and inventory obsolescence 

pandemic product shortages may also require the company to attempt to procure products from new suppliers or through brokers with whom it has a limited or no prior relationship despite due diligence and product compliance protocols the products from these sources may not be delivered on a timely basis or at all or their quality may not be as represented all of which could cause grainger to incur costs including the expense of procuring alternate products or recalling or replacing products in addition to other adverse impacts to grainger’s business 

moreover global outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic have resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the economies of many countries resulting in a global or regional economic downturn or recession any such recession could result in a significant decline in demand for the 

company’s products or limit grainger’s ability to access capital markets on terms that are attractive or at all any of which could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the duration and ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition including liquidity capital and financing resources will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time such factors and developments may include the geographic spread severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including whether there are periods of increased covid19 cases disruption to grainger’s operations resulting from employee illnesses the development availability and administration of effective treatment or vaccines the extent and duration of the impact on the us or global economy including the pace and extent of recovery when the pandemic subsides and the actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak including current and future health and safety measures such as mandatory facility closures of nonessential businesses stay in shelter health orders or similar restrictions social distancing mandates and travel bans import and export restrictions pricing mandates including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes and mandatory directives that certain products be allocated or provided to certain customers which could disrupt the company’s relationship with customers among other actions if the company is unable to respond to and manage the impact of these events the company’s business and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected 

weakness in the economy market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of grainger’s customers could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

economic political and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity capital spending and demand for products and services of grainger’s customers many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty trade and tariff policies costs of goods sold currency exchange rates central bank interest rate changes foreign competition offshoring of production oil and natural gas prices geopolitical developments labor shortages inflation natural or human induced disasters extreme weather outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic deflation and a variety of other factors beyond grainger’s control any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases reduce production levels or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services 

any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger or impair the ability of grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on grainger’s selling prices and terms of sale accordingly a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in canada china japan mexico the uk the us or any other major world economy or a segment of any such economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for grainger’s products and services 

grainger competes in a variety of ways including product assortment and availability services offered to customers pricing purchasing convenience and the overall experience grainger offers this includes the ease of use of grainger’s hightouch operations branches and digital platforms and delivery of products 

there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency 

to remain competitive the company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures downward pressure on sales prices changes in the volume of orders and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause grainger’s gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace these pressures could have a material effect on grainger’s sales and profitability if the company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs among other actions the company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

moreover grainger expects technological advancements and the increased use of ecommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace as a result grainger’s ability to effectively compete requires grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments implementing new technology and innovations may result in unexpected costs and interruptions to operations may take longer than expected and may not provide all anticipated benefits 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins 

some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives rare earth minerals or other materials or inputs required to manufacture ppe and other pandemicrelated products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market the price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility which among other things could be driven by economic monetary political or weatherrelated factors fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services including as a result of outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic could affect transportation costs grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could reduce demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

unexpected product shortages tariffs product cost increases and risks associated with grainger’s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 4500 suppliers located in various countries around the world not one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases 

while grainger has not generally encountered significant difficulty in procuring sources of supply disruptions could occur due to factors beyond grainger’s control these factors could include economic downturns outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the covid19 pandemic which from time to time has resulted in some shortages of ppe cleaning supplies and other products natural or human induced disasters extreme weather geopolitical unrest tariffs new tariffs or tariff increases trade issues and policies detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products labor problems experienced by grainger’s suppliers transportation availability and cost shortage of raw materials unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply inflation and other factors any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in grainger’s product costs 

further grainger sources products from asia and other areas of the world this increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required and distances involved 

if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer base or product mix could cause changes in grainger’s revenue or gross margin or affect grainger’s competitive position 

from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer base and product mix that affect gross margin changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities competition and the increased use of ecommerce by grainger and its competitors for example as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company has sold higher volumes of lowermargin pandemicrelated products to larger lowermargin customers while nonpandemic sales have decreased 

in addition grainger has entered and may in the future continue to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices if the company is unable to enter into or sustain contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with gpos graingers results of operations could be adversely affected 

as customer base and product mix change over time grainger must identify new products product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs the inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into grainger’s existing mix could have a negative impact on future sales growth and grainger’s competitive position 

disruptions in grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

the occurrence of one or more natural or human induced disasters including earthquakes storms hurricanes floods fires droughts tornados and other extreme weather pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the covid19 pandemic geopolitical events such as war civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of grainger’s logistics or supply chain network for example the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the operations of the company and its suppliers and customers any such disruption or other catastrophic event could cause one or more of grainger’s distribution centers or branches to become nonoperational adversely affect grainger’s ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner impair grainger’s ability to meet customer demand for products result in lost sales additional costs or penalties or damage grainger’s reputation grainger’s ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues 

the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or human induced disasters extreme weather power losses telecommunication failures user error third party actions such as malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks and cybersecurity breaches and other problems in addition from time to time grainger relies on the information technology it systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business 

if grainger’s systems or those of third parties on which grainger depends are damaged breached or cease to function properly grainger may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interruptions in its business operations in the interim if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable grainger’s ability to operate its ecommerce platforms process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable disburse funds manage its supply chain monitor results of operations and process and store employee or customer data among other functions could be adversely affected any such interruption of grainger’s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security could damage grainger’s reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues 

through grainger’s sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores personally identifiable confidential proprietary and other information from customers so that they may among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs register on grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company moreover grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business customers suppliers and employees and other sensitive matters 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in the company’s information systems if successful these attacks may expose grainger to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of business operations 

graingers it infrastructure also includes products and services provided by suppliers vendors and other third parties and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of systems and proprietary or confidential information moreover from time to time grainger may share information with these third parties in connection with the products and services they provide to the business while grainger requires assurances that these third parties will protect confidential information there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised if successful those attempting to penetrate grainger’s or 

its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable credit card confidential proprietary or other sensitive customer supplier employee or business information or cause systems disruption while many of graingers agreements with these third parties include indemnification provisions the company may not be able to recover sufficiently or at all under such provisions to adequately offset any losses it may incur 

moreover the company may face the threat to its computer systems of unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code ransomware phishing organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions such tactics may also seek to cause payments due to or from the company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts which may not be recoverable by the company 

in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information further grainger’s systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases and a breach of the company’s information systems could be used to gain illicit access to a customer’s systems and information 

grainger maintains information security staff policies and procedures for managing risk to its information security systems conducts employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilizes consultants to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of the security of its it systems while grainger has instituted these and other safeguards for the protection of information because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures any breach of grainger’s security measures or any breach error or malfeasance of those of its third party service providers could cause grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers suppliers employees and other parties whose personal data is compromised and to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues in addition although grainger maintains insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses 

grainger continuously evaluates the need to upgrade andor replace its systems and network infrastructure to protect its computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of its systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and it could adversely impact its operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems in addition the companys systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other it disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have an adverse effect on its business 

loss of customer supplier employee or intellectual property or other business information or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could disrupt operations damage grainger’s reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and others any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations in the past grainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents in each instance grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures while these incidents have not been deemed to be material to grainger there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to grainger’s operations and financial condition 

grainger’s ability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations 

grainger’s business relies on the use validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property which includes current and future patents trade secrets trademarks service marks copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties unauthorized use of grainger’s intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect grainger’s rights in addition grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others which could subject grainger to liability require grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause grainger to modify its operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations 

grainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency while the financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of grainger’s subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars in addition grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the us dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger’s international subsidiaries primarily the canadian dollar euro pound sterling mexican peso renminbi and yen arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries sales to customers purchases from suppliers and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain train motivate develop and transition executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies the companys employee hiring and retention also depend on its ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables its employees to thrive 

grainger’s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for diverse talent higher employee turnover increased employee benefit costs failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees further changes in the companys management team may be disruptive to its business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect its business and results of operations 

grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of grainger’s reputation 

one of the reasons customers choose to do business with grainger and employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years grainger devotes time and resources to environmental social and governance esg efforts that are consistent with its corporate values and are designed to strengthen its business and protect and preserve its reputation including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility strong communities diversity equity and inclusion gender equality and environmental sustainability grainger’s failure to execute its esg programs as planned could adversely affect the company’s reputation business and financial performance to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of grainger’s brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on grainger’s business 

grainger is subject to various domestic and foreign laws regulations and standards failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect grainger’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

grainger’s business is subject to legislative legal and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates in addition to grainger’s us operations which in 2020 generated approximately 78 of its consolidated net sales grainger operates its business principally through whollyowned subsidiaries in canada china mexico and the uk and its majorityowned subsidiary in japan

impact of the covid19 pandemic on grainger businesses 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted and is likely to continue impacting grainger’s businesses and operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers 

from a customer perspective business reopenings and related activity throughout the year varied based on geography industry and covid19 pandemic conditions for example in the us and endless assortment businesses sales to government healthcare and other essential businesses remained strong but sales to nonessential and disrupted industries were depressed compared to precovid19 pandemic levels the canada business and other international hightouch businesses were severely impacted by pandemicrelated slowdowns with each geography experiencing meaningful yearoveryear declines 

the companys major operational facilities and infrastructure ie dcs branches ecommerce sites and logistic partners remained operational during 2020 with limited disruptions while adhering to strict safety and socialdistancing protocols from an inventory management and supply chain perspective the company has experienced elevated levels of demand for pandemicrelated products while demand for nonpandemic products has declined 

to date the company has been able to absorb the pandemic impact with minimal workforce reductions or furloughs which positions the company for accelerated growth once postpandemic recovery commences also the company has prioritized maintaining all facilities safe for customers and employees to work and interact 

with respect to the company’s financial position the company plans to maintain its focus on liquidity as pandemicrelated uncertainties continue into 2021 during 2020 the company generated operating cash of 11 billion and used the cash generated to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases as of december 31 2020 the company had approximately 18 billion in available liquidity including 585 million in cash for further detail on cash flows refer to the financial condition section below

in addition starting in midfebruary 2020 the company began experiencing elevated levels of covid19 pandemicrelated product sales eg personal protective equipment ppe and safety products due to higher customer demand in response to the covid19 pandemic while nonpandemic sales have decreased the incremental demand came primarily from customers on the frontlines of the pandemic including government healthcare and other essential businesses while the demand from nonessential and disrupted industries decreased over the same period due to business activity slowdown or temporary shutdowns grainger experienced adverse gross margin impacts from sales of lowermargin covid19 pandemicrelated products to the companys largest lowest margin customers

income taxes of 192 million for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 122 million or 39 compared to 314 million for the same period in 2019 this decrease was primarily driven by lower taxable operating earnings for the year tax losses from the companys investment in fabory due to the impairment and internal reorganization of the companys holdings in fabory in the first quarter of 2020 and tax impacts of the fabory divestiture graingers effective tax rates were 203 and 260 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and this decrease is primarily due to the fabory tax impacts

overall revenue increases for the us business were primarily driven by covid19 pandemicrelated sales which accounted for the majority of the sales growth beginning in midfebruary 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic the us business experienced strong sales volume of pandemicrelated products primarily from large government and healthcare customers however sales to nonessential and disrupted industries are down compared to 2019 see note 3 to the financial statements for information related to disaggregated revenue from a product perspective the us business experienced strong demand for covid19 pandemicrelated products however this elevated demand was partially offset by lower demand of nonpandemic products 

gross profit margin decreased 25 percentage points compared to the same period in 2019 the decrease was the result of pandemic related headwinds including product customer mix and inventory writedowns to reflect current 

market dynamics the company expects these pandemic related decreases to subdue as the economy recovers and shifts back towards nonpandemic products which should normalize product mix and margins back to precovid19 levels 

sga for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 2 compared to the same period in 2019 which is primarily driven by reduced travel and depreciation expenses partially offset by incremental operating costs to support the us business response to the covid19 pandemic and related activities 

operating earnings of 1299 million decreased 92 million or 7 from 1391 million in the same period of 2019 this decrease was driven primarily by lower gross profit dollars

sga decreased 13 million or 7 in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 excluding restructuring net in both periods as noted in the table above sga would have decreased 25 million or 14 compared to the prior period this decrease was primarily due to lower variable costs from lower sales and cost management actions to improve sga leverage 

operating losses were 16 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to earnings of 3 million in the same period in 2019 excluding restructuring net in both periods as noted in the table above operating losses would have been 4 million compared to operating earnings of 3 million in the prior period primarily due to lower sales volume 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses were 2762 million for the year ended december 31 2020 an increase of 111 million or 42 when compared to the same period in 2019 the net sales increase was primarily due to incremental sales within the endless assortment businesses on a daily basis net sales increased 38 and consisted of the following

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to graingers business that could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which the company is exposed 

  

weakness in the economy market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of graingers customers could negatively impact graingers sales growth and results of operations 

  

economic political and industry trends affect graingers business environments grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity capital spending and demand for products and services of graingers customers many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty trade and tariff policies costs of goods sold currency exchange rates central bank interest rate changes foreign competition offshoring of production oil and natural gas prices geopolitical developments labor shortages inflation deflation and a variety of other factors beyond graingers control any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases reduce production levels or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services 

  

any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger or impair the ability of graingers customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on graingers selling prices and terms of sale accordingly a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the us canada or any other major world economy or a segment of any such economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth and results of operations 

  

the facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for graingers products and services 

  

grainger competes in a variety of ways including product assortment and availability services offered to customers pricing purchasing convenience and the overall experience grainger offers this includes the ease of use of graingers hightouch highservice operations branches and digital platforms and delivery of products 

  

there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency 

  

to remain competitive the company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures downward pressure on sales prices changes in the volume of our orders and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline we may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace these pressures could have a material effect on grainger’s sales and profitability if the company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs among other actions the company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

moreover grainger expects technological advancements and the increased use of ecommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace as a result graingers ability to effectively compete requires grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments implementing new technology and innovations may result in unexpected costs and interruptions to operations may take longer than expected and may not provide all anticipated benefits 

  

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins 

  

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs graingers ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could reduce demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

  

unexpected product shortages tariffs and risks associated with graingers suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

  

graingers competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 5000 suppliers located in various countries around the world not one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases 

  

historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond graingers control including economic downturns geopolitical unrest tariffs new tariffs or tariff increases trade issues and policies labor problems experienced by graingers suppliers transportation availability and cost shortage of raw materials inflation and other factors any of which could adversely affect a suppliers ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in graingers product costs 

  

further grainger sources products from asia and other areas of the world this increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required and distances involved 

  

if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and graingers reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer base or product mix could cause changes in graingers gross margin or affect graingers competitive position 

  

from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer base and product mix that affect gross margin changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities competition and the increased use of ecommerce by grainger and its competitors there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future 

  

additionally as customer base and product mix change over time grainger must identify new products product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs the inability to introduce new products and effectively integrate them into graingers existing product mix could have a negative impact on future sales growth and graingers competitive position 

  

disruptions in graingers supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as earthquakes storms hurricanes floods fires droughts tornados and other extreme weather pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the coronavirus outbreak geopolitical events such as war civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of graingers logistics or supply chain network for example should the coronavirus outbreak persist or spread it could disrupt the operations of the company and its suppliers and customers any such disruption or other catastrophic event could cause one or more of graingers distribution centers or branches to become nonoperational adversely affect graingers ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner impair graingers ability to meet customer demand for products result in lost sales additional costs or penalties or damage graingers reputation graingers ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of graingers business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance 

  

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues 

  

the proper functioning of graingers information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems although graingers information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power losses telecommunication failures user error third party actions 

such as malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks and cybersecurity breaches and other problems in addition from time to time grainger relies on the it systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business 

  

if graingers systems or those of third parties on which grainger depends are damaged breached or cease to function properly grainger may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interruptions in its business operations in the interim if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable graingers ability to operate its ecommerce platforms process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable disburse funds manage its supply chain monitor results of operations and process and store employee or customer data among other functions could be adversely affected any such interruption of graingers information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security could damage graingers reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues 

  

through graingers sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores personally identifiable confidential proprietary and other information from customers so that they may among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs register on graingers websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company moreover graingers operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business customers suppliers and employees and other sensitive matters 

  

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in the companys information systems 

  

moreover from time to time grainger may share information with vendors and other third parties that assist with certain aspects of the business while grainger requires assurances that these vendors and other parties will protect confidential information there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised if successful those attempting to penetrate graingers or its vendors information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable credit card confidential proprietary or other sensitive customer supplier employee or business information or cause systems disruption 

  

in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information further graingers systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases and a breach of the companys information systems could be used to gain illicit access to customer systems and information 

  

while grainger has instituted safeguards for the protection of such information because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures any breach of graingers security measures or any breach error or malfeasance of those of its third party service providers could cause grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers suppliers employees and other parties whose personal data is compromised and to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues 

loss of customer supplier employee or intellectual property or other business information or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could disrupt operations damage graingers reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and others any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations in the past grainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents in each instance grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures while these incidents have not been deemed to be material to grainger there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to graingers operations and financial condition 

  

graingers ability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations 

  

graingers business relies on the use validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property which includes current and future patents trade secrets trademarks service marks copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties unauthorized use of graingers intellectual property by others could result in harm to various 

aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect grainger’s rights in addition grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others which could subject grainger to liability require grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause grainger to modify its operations 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations 

  

graingers exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entitys functional currency while the consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of graingers subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars in addition grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the us dollar relative to the local currencies of graingers international subsidiaries primarily the canadian dollar euro pound sterling mexican peso renminbi and yen arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries sales to customers purchases from suppliers and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiarys functional currency and that could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect graingers results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings 

  

an inability to successfully implement grainger’s strategy or to integrate acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

  

grainger has implemented and is implementing several initiatives to increase sales and earnings if grainger is unable to successfully implement these initiatives grainger’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability there is also risk relating to graingers ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions additionally problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic or political conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could and have in the past become impaired 

  

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

  

in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies graingers results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of grainger’s reputation 

one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of graingers brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish graingers brand and lead to adverse effects on graingers business 

grainger is subject to various domestic and foreign laws regulations and standards failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect graingers financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

graingers business is subject to legislative legal and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates in addition to graingers us operations which in 2019 generated approximately 72 of its consolidated net sales grainger operates its business principally through whollyowned subsidiaries in canada china germany mexico the netherlands and the united kingdom and its majorityowned subsidiary in japan 

the wide array of laws regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where grainger operates include but are not limited to advertising and marketing regulations antibribery and corruption laws anticompetition regulations data protection including because grainger accepts credit cards the payment card industry data security standard data privacy including in the us the california consumer privacy act and in the european union the general data protection regulation 2016 with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country and cybersecurity requirements including protection of information and incident responses environmental protection laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions health and safety laws import and export requirements intellectual property laws labor laws including federal and state wage and hour laws product compliance or safety laws supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products tax laws including as to us taxes on foreign subsidiaries unclaimed property laws and laws regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters moreover grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business 

failure to comply with any of these laws regulations and standards could result in civil criminal monetary and nonmonetary fines penalties andor remediation costs as well as potential damage to the companys reputation changes in these laws regulations and standards or in their interpretation could increase the cost of doing business including among other factors as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes furthermore while grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws regulations and standards there can be no assurance that employees contractors suppliers vendors or other third parties will not violate such laws regulations and standards or graingers policies any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect graingers financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

in addition graingers business and results of operations in the uk may be negatively affected by changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws resulting from the uks anticipated exit from the european union 

grainger is subject to a number of rules and regulations related to its government contracts which may result in increased compliance costs and potential liabilities 

graingers contracts with us federal state and local government entities are subject to various regulations related to procurement formation and performance in addition the companys government contracts may provide for termination reduction or modification by the government at any time with or without cause from time to time grainger is subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits related to its compliance with these rules and regulations violations of these regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions the inability to participate in existing or future government contracting and other administrative sanctions any such penalties could result in damage to the companys reputation increased costs of compliance andor remediation and could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations 

in conducting its business grainger may become subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations including in connection with product liability or product compliance claims if people property or the environment are harmed by grainger’s products or services 

grainger is and from time to time may become party to a number of legal proceedings or governmental investigations for alleged violations of laws rules or regulations grainger also may be subject to disputes and proceedings incidental to its business including productrelated claims for personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage including the proceedings discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings grainger also may be requested or required to recall products or take other actions the defense of these proceedings may require significant expenses and divert managements time and attention and grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the company’s 

reputation could also be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the company against potential loss exposures 

tax changes could affect graingers effective tax rate and future profitability 

  

graingers future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in graingers overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax legislation the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of the companys tax exposures 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that included significant changes to the taxation of business entities the companys accounting for the tax effects of such legislation may be subject to change due to subsequent clarification or amendment of the tax law which could adversely affect the companys operating results or financial condition 

  

graingers common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines 

  

the trading price of graingers common stock is subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuation due to changes in economic political and market conditions the operating results of grainger and its competitors changes in expectations as to graingers future financial or operating performance including estimates by securities analysts and investors the company’s failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements provided to the public changes in capital structure share repurchase programs or dividend policies and a number of other factors including those discussed in this item 1a these factors many which are outside of graingers control could cause stock price volatility or graingers stock price to decline 

changes in grainger’s credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs 

grainger’s credit ratings are based on a number of factors including the company’s financial strength and factors outside of grainger’s control such as conditions affecting grainger’s industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies grainger cannot provide assurances that its current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if rating agencies lower suspend or withdraw the ratings the market price or marketability of grainger’s securities may be adversely affected in addition any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the company to raise capital on favorable terms impact the company’s ability to obtain adequate financing and result in higher interest costs for the company’s existing credit facilities or on future financings 

grainger has incurred substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness which could adversely affect cash flow decrease business flexibility or prevent grainger from fulfilling its obligations 

as of december 31 2019 grainger’s consolidated indebtedness was approximately 24 billion the company’s indebtedness could among other things limit grainger’s ability to respond to rapidly changing business and economic conditions require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness reducing the funds available for other business purposes and make it more difficult to satisfy the company’s financial obligations as they come due during periods of adverse economic and industry conditions 

the agreements governing grainger’s debt agreements and instruments contain representations warranties affirmative negative and financial covenants and default provisions grainger’s failure to comply with these restrictions and obligations could result in a default under such agreements which may allow grainger’s creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on grainger’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future 

in addition grainger may in the future seek to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures refinancing of indebtedness share repurchases or other general corporate purposes grainger’s ability to obtain additional financing will be dependent on among other things the company’s financial condition prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond the company’s control such additional financing may not be available 

on commercially reasonable terms or at all any inability to obtain financing when needed could materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which the company is exposed 

weakness in the economy market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of grainger’s customers could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

economic political and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity capital spending and demand for products and services of grainger’s customers many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty trade and tariff policies costs of goods sold currency exchange rates central bank interest rate changes foreign competition offshoring of production oil and natural gas prices geopolitical developments labor shortages inflation deflation and a variety of other factors beyond grainger’s control any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases reduce production levels or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services 

any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger or impair the ability of grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on grainger’s selling prices and terms of sale accordingly a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the us canada or any other major world economy or a segment of any such economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for grainger’s products and services 

grainger competes in a variety of ways including product assortment and availability services offered to customers pricing purchasing convenience and the overall experience grainger offers this includes the ease of use of grainger’s hightouch highservice operations branches and digital platforms and delivery of products 

there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency 

to remain competitive the company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures these pressures and the implementation timing and results of grainger’s strategic pricing and other responses could have a material effect on grainger’s sales and profitability if the company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs among other actions to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of its pricing actions the company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

moreover grainger expects technological advancements and the increased use of ecommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace as a result grainger’s ability to effectively compete requires grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments and implement new technology and innovations that may result in unexpected costs or may take longer than expected 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins 

some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

 8 

unexpected product shortages tariffs and risks associated with grainger’s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 5000 suppliers located in various countries around the world not one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases 

historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond grainger’s control including economic downturns geopolitical unrest new tariffs or tariff increases trade issues and policies labor problems experienced by grainger’s suppliers transportation availability and cost inflation and other factors any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in grainger’s product costs 

further grainger sources products from asia and other areas of the world this increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required and distances involved 

if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer base or product mix could cause changes in grainger’s gross margin or affect grainger’s competitive position 

from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer base and product mix that affect gross margin changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities and competition there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future 

additionally as customer base and product mix change over time grainger must identify new products product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs the inability to introduce new products and effectively integrate them into grainger’s existing product mix could have a negative impact on future sales growth and grainger’s competitive position 

disruptions in grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as earthquakes storms hurricanes floods fires droughts tornados and other extreme weather geopolitical events such as war civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of grainger’s logistics or supply chain network any such disruption could cause one or more of grainger’s distribution centers or branches to become nonoperational adversely affect grainger’s ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner impair grainger’s ability to meet customer demand for products result in lost sales additional costs or penalties or damage grainger’s reputation grainger’s ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues 

the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power losses telecommunication failures user error third party actions such as malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks and cybersecurity breaches and other problems 

if grainger’s systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly grainger may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interruptions in its business operations in the interim if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things grainger’s ability to process orders 

 9 

maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of grainger’s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security could damage grainger’s reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues 

through grainger’s sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores personally identifiable confidential proprietary and other information from customers so that they may among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs register on grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company moreover grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business customers suppliers and employees and other sensitive matters 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems 

moreover from time to time grainger may share information with vendors and other third parties that assist with certain aspects of the business while grainger requires assurances that these vendors and other parties will protect confidential information there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised if successful those attempting to penetrate grainger’s or its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate personally identifiable credit card confidential proprietary or other sensitive customer supplier employee or business information or cause systems disruption 

in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information further grainger’s systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases and a breach of the company’s information systems could be used to gain illicit access to customer systems and information 

while grainger has instituted safeguards for the protection of such information because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures any breach of grainger’s security measures or any breach error or malfeasance of those of its third party service providers could cause grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers suppliers employees and other parties whose personal data is compromised and to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage grainger’s reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and others any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations 

in the past grainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents in each instance grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures while these incidents have not been deemed to be material to grainger there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to graingers operations and financial condition 

grainger’s ability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations 

grainger’s business relies on the use validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property which includes current and future patents trade secrets trademarks service marks copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties unauthorized use of grainger’s intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect its rights in addition grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others which could subject grainger to liability require grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause grainger to modify its operations 

 10 

fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations  

grainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency while the consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of grainger’s subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars in addition grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the us dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger’s international subsidiaries primarily the canadian dollar euro pound sterling mexican peso renminbi and yen arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries sales to customers purchases from suppliers and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings 

acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability there is also risk relating to grainger’s ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions additionally problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic or political conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could and have in the past become impaired 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies grainger’s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of grainger’s reputation 

one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of grainger’s brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on grainger’s business

other expense net was 99 million in 2017 compared to 94 million of expense in 2016 the increase in expense was primarily due to incremental interest expense on 400 million in longterm debt issued in may 2016 and 400 million in longterm debt issued in may 2017 as well as higher operating losses from the companys clean energy investments partially offset by higher benefits related to the companys postretirement plan see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information

financial condition

cash and cash equivalents 

at december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  grainger had cash and cash equivalents of 538 million 327 million and 274 million respectively approximately 49 66 and 71 were outside the us business as of december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively grainger has no material limits or restrictions on its ability to use these foreign liquid assets 

cash flow 

2018  compared to 2017 

net cash provided by operating activities was  1057 million  for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  and 2017  as increased net earnings were offset by investment in inventory and timing of payables 

net cash used in investing activities was  166 million  and  146 million  for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by lower proceeds primarily from the sales of branch real estate assets in the us and a us business divestiture when compared to the prior year 

net cash used in financing activities was  670 million  and  867 million  in the twelve months ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by lower stock repurchases in 2018 compared to 2017 and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

2017  compared to 2016 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1057 million and 1024 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of higher accruals related to employee benefits partially offset by lower earnings and higher working capital 

net cash used in investing activities was 146 million and 262 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was driven by lower additions to property buildings and equipment compared to the prior year and higher proceeds primarily from the sales of branch real estate assets in the us and a us business divestiture when compared to the prior year 

net cash used in financing activities was 867 million and 776 million in the twelve months ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher net payments of commercial paper offset by lower stock repurchases in 2017 compared to 2016 and lower payments of longterm debt 

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used for growth initiatives and capital expenditures graingers working capital is not impacted by significant seasonality trends throughout the year 

working capital consists of current assets less nonoperating cash and current liabilities less shortterm debt and current maturities of longterm debt working capital was 1898 million  at december 31 2018  compared with 1669 million  at december 31 2017  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in accounts payable at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 24  and 22  respectively 

 27 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of the companys net cash flows has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software presented in intangibles  net on the consolidated balance sheet as summarized in the following table in millions of dollars 



in 2018 the company continued to invest in its north american distribution network eg new or expanding existing facilities and technology other investments include the consolidation of facility and office locations and development of software solutions

in 2019 capital expenditures are expected to range from 300 million to 350 million projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain investment in a dc in japan software development and inventory management solutions grainger expects to fund 2019  capital spending primarily from operating cash flows

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2018  graingers contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in millions of dollars 



see notes 8 9 and 11 to the financial statements for further detail related to debt interest on debt and operating lease obligations 

purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and other employee benefit plans 

the company’s obligation for the postretirement healthcare benefits plan as determined by actuarial projections is 190 million at december 31 2018  the company has established a group benefit trust trust to fund the plan obligations the trust assets available for benefits payments are 176 million at december 31 2018  the company has no minimum funding requirements and the timing and amounts of the company’s additional contributions into the trust have not been determined other employmentrelated benefits obligations of 53 million have also not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not predictable see note 10 to the financial statements for further detail 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately 41 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2018  this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot predict the timing of these cash payments by period see note 15 to the financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements all significant contractual obligations are recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheet or disclosed in the notes to graingers consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

note 1 to the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as discussed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 

accounting policies and estimates are considered critical when they require management to make subjective and complex judgments estimates and assumptions about matters that have a material impact on graingers financial statements and accompanying notes 

 29 

the company believes that the following discussion addresses grainger’s most critical accounting policies and estimates 

inventory reserves   

grainger establishes inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory cost and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 17 million stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically 

graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves that could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets   

grainger’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change the company tests for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic industry and market trends and significant events impacting reporting units’ current and future performance if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed 

in the quantitative impairment tests the company uses the discounted cash flow market approach and royalty relief methods which require significant assumptions and judgments with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates capital investments changes in working capital use the selection of an appropriate discount rate and terminal growth rate among other assumptions and estimates the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could impact the company’s estimated fair values of reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets and potentially result in different impacts on the company’s results of operations actual results could differ from the company’s assumptions and estimates see note 4 to the financial statements for further information 

income taxes    

the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law which significantly revised the us corporate income tax system including lowering the corporate income tax rates from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information 

future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

contingent liabilities     

at any time grainger may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against grainger such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability general negligence contract disputes environmental issues unclaimed property wage and hour laws intellectual property employment practices regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees customers competitors suppliers or governmental entities as a government contractor selling to federal state and local governmental entities the company is also subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings including those related to contract administration or to pricing compliance grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation auto liability general liability and property losses 

 30 

through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposures as appropriate for claims against grainger when losses become probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies where grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes graingers best estimate grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against grainger when losses are reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to graingers consolidated financial statements these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond graingers control if the assessment of any of these factors changes the estimates may change predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 

other     

other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1  to the financial statements 

effects of inflation and changing prices 

grainger is affected by inflation through increased product and operating costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to customers over time is dependent upon market conditions the ability to achieve sales growth through increased prices is also subject to inflation and normal competitive conditions the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements 

from time to time in this annual report on form 10k as well as in other written reports communications and verbal statements grainger makes forwardlooking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results business plans analyses prospects strategies objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws forwardlooking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “expect” “could” “forecast” “may” “intend” “plan” “predict” “project” “will” or “would” and similar terms and phrases including references to assumptions 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized and achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond the companys control which could cause graingers results to differ materially from those that are presented 

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forwardlooking statements include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of sources of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies failure to adequately protect intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims the implementation timing and results of the companys strategic pricing initiatives and other responses to market pressures the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory 

 31 

proceedings including with respect to wage and hour antibribery and corruption environmental   advertising privacy and cybersecurity matters investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry economic market or political conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility including volatility or price declines of the companys common stock commodity price volatility labor shortages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated andor extreme weather conditions loss of key members of management the companys ability to operate integrate and leverage acquired businesses changes in effective tax rates and other factors identified under item 1a risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10k 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rates 

grainger’s financial results including the value of assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the business units as stated in their local currencies are translated into us dollars while it is difficult to quantify any particular impact of changes in exchange rates a uniform 10 strengthening in the us dollar whereby all other variables are held constant and unusual expense items described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are excluded would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of 3 million for the year ended december 31 2018  and an increase in net earnings of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2017  comparatively a 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of 3 million for the year ended december 31 2018  and a decrease in net earnings of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2017  this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in future potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

commodity price risk 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which the company is exposed 

weakness in the economy market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of grainger’s customers could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments grainger serves several industries in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity capital spending and demand for products and services of grainger’s customers many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty costs of goods sold currency exchange rates foreign competition offshoring of production oil and natural gas prices geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors beyond grainger’s control any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases reduce production levels or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services 

any of these events could impair the ability of grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger and could cause increased pressure on grainger’s selling prices and terms of sale accordingly a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the us canada or any other major world economy or a segment of any such economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for grainger’s products and services 

there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency 

to remain competitive the company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures including pricing whether widely available or negotiated under a contract delivery and services these pressures and the implementation timing and results of our strategic pricing and other responses could have a material effect on graingers sales and profitability if the company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs among other actions to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of our pricing actions the companys results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the industry is also consolidating as customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations this consolidation could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by competitors or as competitors with a new lower cost business models are able to operate with lower prices 

changes in inflation may adversely affect gross margins   

inflation impacts the costs at which grainger can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which grainger is able to increase sales through price increases 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins   

some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

 7 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations   

grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 5200 suppliers located in various countries around the world not one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond grainger’s control including economic downturns geopolitical unrest port slowdowns trade issues and other factors any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products as grainger continues to source lower cost products from asia and other areas of the world the risk for disruptions has increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline 

from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities and competition if rapid growth with larger lower margin customers continues grainger will face pressure to maintain current gross margins as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future 

disruptions in grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations   

a disruption within grainger’s logistics or supply chain network including damage destruction extreme weather and other events which could cause one or more of grainger’s distribution centers to become nonoperational could adversely affect grainger’s ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner impair grainger’s ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to grainger’s reputation grainger’s ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues 

the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses computer viruses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things grainger’s ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of grainger’s information systems could also subject grainger to additional costs 

breaches of information systems security could damage grainger’s reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues 

  

through grainger’s sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores personally identifiable confidential proprietary and other information from customers so that they may among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs register on grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company moreover grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business customers suppliers and employees and other sensitive matters 

while grainger has instituted safeguards for the protection of such information during the normal course of business grainger has experienced and expects to continue to experience attempts to breach the company’s information systems and grainger may be unable to protect sensitive data andor the integrity of the company’s information systems a cybersecurity incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls encryption and other security defenses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to 

 8 

sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

moreover from time to time grainger may share information with vendors and other third parties that assist with certain aspects of the business while grainger requires assurances that these vendors and other parties will protect confidential information there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised if successful those attempting to penetrate grainger’s or its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate personally identifiable credit card confidential proprietary or other sensitive customer supplier employee or business information 

in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information further grainger’s systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases and a breach of the company’s information systems could be used to gain illicit access to customer systems and information 

loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage grainger’s reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and others any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations  

grainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency while the consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of grainger’s subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars in addition grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the us dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger’s international subsidiaries primarily the canadian dollar euro pound sterling mexican peso renminbi and yen arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries sales to thirdparty customers purchases from suppliers and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings 

changes in grainger’s credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs 

grainger’s credit ratings are based on a number of factors including grainger’s financial strength and factors outside of grainger’s control such as conditions affecting grainger’s industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies grainger cannot provide assurances that grainger’s current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if rating agencies lower suspend or withdraw the ratings the market price or marketability of grainger’s securities may be adversely affected in addition any change in ratings could make it more difficult for grainger to raise capital on acceptable terms impact the ability to obtain adequate financing and result in higher interest costs for grainger’s existing credit facilities or on future financings 

acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability there is also risk relating to grainger’s ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions additionally problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies grainger’s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of grainger’s reputation   

one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of grainger’s brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on grainger’s business 

grainger is subject to various domestic and foreign laws regulations and standards failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect grainger’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

grainger’s business is subject to a wide array of laws regulations and standards in every domestic and foreign jurisdiction where it operates including advertising and marketing regulations antibribery and corruption laws anticompetition regulations data protection including payment card industry data security standards data privacy including in the us and the european union which has traditionally imposed strict obligations under data privacy laws and regulations that vary from country to country and cybersecurity requirements including protection of information and incident responses environmental protection laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions government business regulations applicable to grainger as a government contractor selling to federal state and local government entities health and safety laws import and export requirements intellectual property laws labor laws product compliance laws supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products tax laws including as to us taxes on foreign subsidiaries unclaimed property laws and laws regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters moreover grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business 

failure to comply with any of these laws regulations and standards could result in civil criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to the company’s reputation changes in these laws regulations and standards or in their interpretation could increase the cost of doing business including among other factors as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes furthermore while grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws regulations and standards there can be no assurance that employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws regulations and standards or grainger’s policies any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect grainger’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

grainger also is and from time to time may become party to a number of legal proceedings incidental to grainger’s business involving alleged damages or injuries arising out of the use of grainger’s products and services or violations of these laws regulations or standards the defense of these proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management’s time and attention and grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the company against potential loss exposures 

tax changes could affect grainger’s effective tax rate and future profitability 

grainger’s future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in grainger’s overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax legislation the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of the company’s tax exposures

matters affecting comparability

results of operations 

the following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in graingers consolidated statements of earnings in millions of dollars 



a may not sum due to rounding 

2017  compared to 2016 

graingers net sales were  10425 million  for 2017  an increase of 3 when compared with net sales of 10137 million  for the comparable 2016  period on a daily basis the 3 increase for the year consisted of the following 

  

the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the single channel online businesses in the us and japan as well as volume increases in the us business as a result of the pricing actions the us business pricing actions were primarily implemented in the first and third quarters of 2017 and included adjusting list price and introducing new lower web prices on the entire business assortment which drove faster growth in 2017 through share gains with existing customers and acquisition of new customers refer to the segment analysis  below for further details 

in 2017  ecommerce sales for grainger were 5283 million an increase of 11 over the prior year total ecommerce sales represented 51 and 47 of total sales for 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase was primarily driven by graingercom and other electronic purchasing platforms in the us and across all single channel online businesses 

 17 

if the company included keepstock® total ecommerce and keepstock® sales would represent 56 and 53 of total sales for 2017  and 2016  respectively refer to the segment analysis  below for further details 

gross profit of  4098 million  for 2017  was down 17 million compared with  4115 million  for 2016  the gross profit margin for 2017  was 393  down 13  percentage points versus 2016  driven primarily by the pricing actions in the us business 

operating expenses of  3049 million  for 2017  increased 2 from  2995 million  for 2016  excluding restructuring costs gains on the sale of assets and other charges in both periods as noted below operating expenses increased 3 driven primarily by higher employee related costs 

operating earnings of  1049 million  for 2017  decreased 6 from  1119 million  for 2016  excluding restructuring costs gains on the sale of assets and other charges in both periods as noted below operating earnings decreased 8 or 107 million driven primarily by lower gross profit and higher operating expenses 

other expense net was 113 million in 2017  compared to 100 million of expense in 2016  the increase in expense was primarily due to incremental interest expense on 400 million in longterm debt issued in may 2016 and 400 million in longterm debt issued in may 2017 as well as higher operating losses from the companys clean energy investments 

income taxes of  313 million  in 2017  decreased 19 compared with  386 million  in 2016  graingers effective tax rates were 335  and 379  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the lower rate versus the prior year is due to discrete tax items and us tax legislation 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law which significantly revised the us corporate income tax system by lowering corporate income tax rates from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 allowing accelerated expensing of qualified capital investments for a specific period limiting net interest expense deductions and transitioning us international taxation from a worldwide to a territorial tax system among other changes grainger recognized a net provisional tax benefit of 32 million for the year ended december 31 2017 related to the estimated impact of the tax act see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

grainger projects a tax rate of 23 to 26 for 2018 which includes the impact of the tax act 

the table below reconciles reported net earnings determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to adjusted net earnings a nongaap measure management believes adjusted net earnings is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names in thousands of dollars 

  

 18 



net earnings attributable to ww grainger inc for 2017  decreased by 3 to  586 million  from  606 million  in 2016  the decrease in net earnings primarily resulted from lower operating earnings partially offset by lower income taxes excluding the net charges from both years mentioned above and discrete tax items net earnings decreased 6

net cash provided by operating activities was  1057 million  and  1024 million  for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of lower payments related to employee benefits partially offset by lower earnings and higher working capital 

net cash used in investing activities was  146 million  and  262 million  for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was driven by lower additions to property buildings and equipment compared to the prior year and higher proceeds primarily from the sales of branch real estate assets in the us and a us business divestiture when compared to the prior year 

net cash used in financing activities was  867 million  and  776 million  in the twelve months ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by lower proceeds of longterm debt and higher net payments of commercial paper offset by lower stock repurchases in 2017 compared to 2016 and lower payments of longterm debt

net cash used in investing activities was 262 million and 843 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the higher use of cash in 2015 was driven by the cromwell acquisition in september 2015 in 2016 lower additions to property buildings and equipment compared to the prior year and higher proceeds from the sale of branch real estate assets contributed to the reduction in cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 776 million and 109 million in the twelve months ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the change in financing activities was primarily driven by the issuance of 400 million in senior notes in 2016 compared to the issuance of 1 billion in senior notes in 2015 and significantly lower stock repurchases in 2016 compared to 2015 

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used for growth initiatives and capital expenditures graingers working capital is not impacted by significant seasonality trends throughout the year

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2017  graingers contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 



see notes 7 8 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to debt interest on debt and operating lease obligations 

purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and other employee benefit plans 

the company’s obligation for the postretirement healthcare benefits plan as determined by actuarial projections is 208 million at december 31 2017 the company has established a group benefit trust trust to fund the plan obligations the trust assets available for benefits payments are 189 million at december 31 2017 the company has no minimum funding requirements and the timing and amounts of the company’s additional contributions into the trust have not been determined other employmentrelated benefits obligations of 65 million have also not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not predictable see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately 45 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2017  this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot predict the timing of these cash payments by period see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

 26 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements all significant contractual obligations are recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheet or disclosed in the notes to graingers consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as discussed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 

accounting policies and estimates are considered critical when they require management to make subjective and complex judgments estimates and assumptions about matters that have a material impact on graingers financial statements and accompanying notes 

the company believes that the following discussion addresses grainger’s most critical accounting policies and estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts   

grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer 

based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable graingers estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

inventory reserves   

grainger establishes inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory cost and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 17 million stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically 

graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves that could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets   

business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets that affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment writedowns that may occur in future periods grainger tests reporting units’ goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist grainger periodically performs qualitative assessments of significant events and circumstances such as reporting units historical and current results assumptions regarding future performance strategic initiatives and overall economic factors to determine the existence of impairment indicators and assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying value and if a quantitative impairment test is necessary in the quantitative test grainger compares the carrying value of the reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset with its fair value any excess of the carrying value over fair value is recorded as an impairment charge 

 27 

the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow dcf method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values the dcf method incorporates various assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows including revenues gross margins operating expenses capital expenditures and working capital based on operational budgets longrange strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period and reflects management’s best estimates for perpetual growth for the reporting units estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value 

grainger’s indefinitelived intangibles are primarily trade names the fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief from royalty method which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset the key assumptions when valuing a trade name are the revenue base the royalty rate and the discount rate 

the company performed its annual tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment including qualitative assessments of all of its reporting units’ goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives quantitative tests of the company’s reporting unit in canada and the cromwell reporting unit in other businesses were also performed due to lowerthanexpected operating performance and lowered shortterm forecasts based on the results of the quantitative tests performed the fair values of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 31 percent for the canada reporting unit and 15 percent for the cromwell reporting unit 

the company performed sensitivity analyses on the reporting units’ fair values utilizing alternate assumptions that reflect reasonably possible changes to future assumptions holding all other assumptions constant the impact of a 100 basis point increase in discount rates or a 100 basis point decrease in terminal growth rates would have not resulted in the reporting units failing the quantitative tests 

while the company’s impairment test and respective sensitivity analyses supported no impairment of goodwill and intangibles the risk of potential failure of quantitative tests in future reporting periods is highly dependent upon key assumptions included in the determination of reporting unit or intangible fair values changes in assumptions regarding future performance and the ability to execute on growth initiatives and productivity improvements may have a significant impact on future cash flows likewise changes in terminal value and discount rate assumptions unfavorable economic environment or market conditions and other factors may result in future impairments of goodwill and intangible assets the company will continue to monitor results and projected cash flows to assess whether goodwill or intangible impairments may be necessary 

postretirement healthcare benefits     

the postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on graingers postretirement benefit obligation and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

during the third quarter of 2017 the company implemented plan design changes effective january 1 2018 for the post65 age group this plan change will move all post65 medicare eligible retirees to healthcare exchanges and provide them a subsidy to purchase insurance the amount of the subsidy will be based on years of service the plan obligation was remeasured as a result of this plan design change the company has elected to amortize the amount of net unrecognized gains over a period equal to the average remaining service period for active plan participants expected to retire and receive benefits grainger estimates that this plan change could increase 2018 pretax earnings by approximately 53 million however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect   

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year    a higher discount rate reduces the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs   as of december 31 2017  grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 400 to 344 to reflect the decrease in market interest rates   grainger estimates that this decrease could decrease 2018  pretax earnings by approximately 20 million   however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

 28 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2017  results in thousands of dollars 



grainger used mortality table rph2014 and changed the mortality improvement scale used to project mortality rates into the future from mortality improvement scale mp2016 to mortality improvement scale mp2017 at december 31 2017 mortality table rph2014 is a headcountweighted table that is more appropriate for the measurement of other postretirement employee benefit plans scale mp2017 published by the society of actuaries reflects the most recent data for mortality improvement grainger estimates this change could increase 2018 pretax earnings by approximately 02 million 

grainger updated the 2017 census for involuntary terminations that occurred in 2017 grainger estimates this change could increase 2018 pretax earnings by approximately 09 million 

when assumptions are selected expected results can vary from actual results graingers expected results varied from actual results for both expected return on plan assets and benefit payments grainger estimates this impact could increase 2018 pretax earnings by approximately 29 million 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and therefore may affect graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes    

the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law which significantly revised the us corporate income tax system including lowering the corporate income tax rates from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

contingent liabilities     

at any time grainger may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against grainger such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability general negligence contract disputes environmental issues unclaimed property wage and hour laws intellectual property employment practices regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees customers competitors suppliers or governmental entities as a government contractor selling to federal state and local governmental entities the company is also subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings including those related to contract administration or to pricing compliance grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation auto liability general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of 

 29 

any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposures as appropriate for claims against grainger when losses become probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies where grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes graingers best estimate grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against grainger when losses are reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to graingers consolidated financial statements these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond graingers control if the assessment of any of these factors changes the estimates may change predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 

other     

other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation and changing prices 

grainger is affected by inflation through increased product and operating costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to customers over time is dependent upon market conditions the ability to achieve sales growth through increased prices is also subject to inflation and normal competitive conditions the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements 

from time to time in this annual report on form 10k as well as in other written reports communications and verbal statements grainger makes forwardlooking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results business plans analyses prospects strategies objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws such forwardlooking statements are identified by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “expect” “could” “forecast” “may” “intend” “plan” “predict” “project” and similar terms and expressions 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond the companys control which could cause graingers results to differ materially from those that are presented 

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the implementation timing and results of the companys strategic pricing initiatives and other responses to market pressures the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings including with respect to wage and hour antibribery and corruption environmental

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update any of its forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rates 

grainger’s financial results including the value of assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the business units as stated in their local currencies are translated into us dollars while it is difficult to quantify any particular impact of changes in exchange rates a uniform 10 strengthening in the us dollar whereby all other variables are held constant and unusual expense items described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are excluded would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2017  and an increase in net earnings of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2016  comparatively a 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2017  and a decrease in net earnings of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2016  this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in future potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

commodity price risk 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which the company is exposed 

weakness in the economy market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of grainger’s customers could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments grainger serves several industries in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity capital spending and demand for products and services of grainger’s customers many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty costs of goods sold currency exchange rates foreign competition offshoring of production oil and natural gas prices geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors beyond grainger’s control any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases reduce production levels or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services 

any of these events could impair the ability of grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger and could cause increased pressure on grainger’s selling prices and terms of sale accordingly a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the united states us canada or any other major world economy or a segment of any such economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for grainger’s products and services 

there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses that compete with price transparency the industry is also consolidating as customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations this consolidation could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by competitors or as competitors with new lower cost business models are able to operate with lower prices and gross profit on products these competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger’s sales and profitability 

changes in inflation may adversely affect gross margins   

inflation impacts the costs at which grainger can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which grainger is able to increase sales through price increases 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins   

some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations   

grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 5100 suppliers located in various countries around the world no one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond grainger’s control including economic downturns political unrest port slowdowns trade issues and other factors any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or 

 7 

deliver products as grainger continues to source lower cost products from asia and other areas of the world the risk for disruptions has increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline 

from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities and competition if rapid growth with lower margin customers continues grainger will face pressure to maintain current gross margins as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future 

disruptions in grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations   

a disruption within grainger’s logistics or supply chain network including damage destruction extreme weather and other events which could cause one or more of grainger’s distribution centers to become nonoperational could adversely affect grainger’s ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner impair grainger’s ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to grainger’s reputation grainger’s ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues 

the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses computer viruses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things grainger’s ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of grainger’s information systems could also subject grainger to additional costs 

breaches of information systems security could damage grainger’s reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues 

  

through grainger’s sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores personally identifiable confidential proprietary and other information from customers so that they may among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs register on grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company moreover grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business customers suppliers and employees and other sensitive matters 

while grainger has instituted safeguards for the protection of such information during the normal course of business grainger has experienced and expects to continue to experience attempts to breach the company’s information systems and grainger may be unable to protect sensitive data andor the integrity of the company’s information systems a cybersecurity incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls encryption and other security defenses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

moreover from time to time grainger may share information with vendors and other third parties that assist with certain aspects of the business while grainger requires assurances that these vendors and other parties will protect confidential information there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised if successful those attempting to penetrate grainger’s or its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate 

 8 

personally identifiable credit card confidential proprietary or other sensitive customer supplier employee or business information 

in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information further grainger’s systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases and a breach of the company’s information systems could be used to gain illicit access to customer systems and information 

loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage grainger’s reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and others any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations  

grainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency while the consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of grainger’s subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars in addition grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the us dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger’s international subsidiaries primarily the canadian dollar euro pound sterling mexican peso renminbi and yen arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries sales to thirdparty customers purchases from suppliers and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings 

changes in grainger’s credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs 

grainger’s credit ratings are based on a number of factors including grainger’s financial strength and factors outside of grainger’s control such as conditions affecting grainger’s industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies grainger cannot provide assurances that grainger’s current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if rating agencies lower suspend or withdraw the ratings the market price or marketability of grainger’s securities may be adversely affected in addition any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the grainger to raise capital on acceptable terms impact the ability to obtain adequate financing and result in higher interest costs for grainger’s existing credit facilities or on future financings 

acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

acquisitions partnerships joint ventures and other business combination transactions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability there is also risk relating to grainger’s ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions additionally problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies grainger’s results of operations 

 9 

could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of grainger’s reputation   

one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of grainger’s brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on grainger’s business 

grainger is subject to various domestic and foreign laws regulations and standards failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect grainger’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

grainger’s business is subject to a wide array of laws regulations and standards in every domestic and foreign jurisdiction where it operates including advertising and marketing regulations antibribery and corruption laws anticompetition regulations data protection including payment card industry data security standards data privacy including in the us and the european union which has traditionally imposed strict obligations under data privacy laws and regulations that vary from country to country and cybersecurity requirements including as to protection of information and incident responses environmental protection laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions government business regulations applicable to grainger as a government contractor selling to federal state and local government entities health and safety laws import and export requirements intellectual property laws labor laws product compliance laws supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products tax laws including as to us taxes on foreign subsidiaries unclaimed property laws and laws regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters moreover grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business 

failure to comply with any of these laws regulations and standards could result in civil criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to the company’s reputation changes in these laws regulations and standards or in their interpretation could increase the cost of doing business including among other factors as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes furthermore while grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws regulations and standards there can be no assurance that employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws regulations and standards or grainger’s policies any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect grainger’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

grainger also is and from time to time may become party to a number of legal proceedings incidental to grainger’s business involving alleged damages or injuries arising out of the use of grainger’s products and services or violations of these laws regulations or standards the defense of these proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management’s time and attention and grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the company against potential loss exposures 

tax changes could affect grainger’s effective tax rate and future profitability 

grainger’s future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in grainger’s overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax legislation the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of the company’s tax exposures

gross profit of  4115 million  for 2016  decreased 3 the gross profit margin for 2016  was 406  down 18  percentage points versus 2015  primarily due to price deflation exceeding cost deflation and unfavorable customer mix 

 17 

operating expenses of  2995 million  for 2016  increased 2 from  2931 million  for 2015  the increase was primarily due to the following

cash flow 

2016 compared to 2015 

net cash provided by operating activities was  1003 million  and  990 million  for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively the increase was primarily the result of lower employee related costs 

net cash used in investing activities was  262 million  and  843 million  for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively the higher use of cash in 2015 was driven by the cromwell acquisition in september 2015 in 2016 lower additions to property buildings and equipment compared to the prior year and higher proceeds from the sale of branch real estate assets contributed to the reduction in cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was  755 million  and  63 million  in the twelve months ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively the change in financing activities was primarily driven by the issuance of 400 million in senior notes in 2016 compared to the issuance of 1 billion in senior notes in 2015 and significantly lower stock repurchases in 2016 compared to 2015 

2015 compared to 2014

net cash used in financing activities of 63 million in 2015 decreased 695 million from 758 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of 1 billion in senior notes a £160 million term loan and issuance of commercial paper to support the acquisition of cromwell as well as ¥6 billion term loans to support the construction of a new distribution center in monotaro these proceeds were partially offset by an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in graingers results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

accounting estimates are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of graingers financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

note 1  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts   grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable graingers estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory cost and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 16 million stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves that could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets that affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment writedowns that may occur in future periods grainger reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 

grainger completed the annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2016 for all of the company’s reporting units the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values except for the fabory reporting unit as of the 2015 test the fair value of the fabory reporting unit exceeded its 106 million carrying value by 15 during the current year testing grainger considered fabory’s performance and the revised outlook prior branch rationalization initiatives and structural changes in the business contributed to cost improvements however declines in sales primarily in the netherlands and france and price pressure contributed to lower earnings for the year the current year business performance and revised financial projections also reflect market conditions which continued to be negatively impacted by the downturn in oil and gas and maritime industries in the netherlands fabory’s largest market the revised outlook and uncertainty beyond 2016 were factored into lower earnings cash flow projections and longterm expectations for fabory’s future performance resulting in the calculated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value in step one of the twostep quantitative test and step two impairment calculations were required as a result a 47 million 

 28 

goodwill impairment charge was recorded with no tax benefit due to the nondeductibility of goodwill in the relevant taxing jurisdictions 

the risk of potential failure of step one of the quantitative tests in future reporting periods is highly dependent upon key assumptions included in the determination of the reporting units fair value the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow dcf method and incorporating value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values the dcf method incorporates various assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future expected cash flows including revenues gross margins operating expenses capital expenditures and working capital based on operational budgets longrange strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period and reflects management’s best estimates for perpetual growth for the reporting units estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value 

changes in assumptions regarding future performance and unfavorable economic environment may have a significant impact on reporting units cash flows in the future grainger performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the reasonableness of the step one results for the reporting units subject to the twostep quantitative tests and evaluated the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate no indications of impairment resulted from this sensitivity analysis given the sensitivity of the calculated fair value to changes in these key assumptions grainger may be required to recognize an impairment for goodwill in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to these key assumptions 

stock incentive plans   grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted used the following assumptions 



the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of graingers stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant because the expense for other stockbased awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements

postretirement healthcare benefits     the postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on graingers postretirement benefit obligation and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year    a higher discount rate reduces the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs   as of december 31 2016  grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 420 to 400 to reflect the decrease in market interest rates   grainger estimates that this decrease could decrease 2017 pretax earnings by approximately 08 million   however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2016  results in thousands of dollars 



grainger used mortality table rph2014 and changed the mortality improvement scale used to project mortality rates into the future from mortality improvement scale mp2015 to mortality improvement scale mp2016 at december 31 2016 mortality table rph2014 is a headcountweighted table that is more appropriate for the measurement of other postretirement employee benefit plans scale mp2016 published by the society of actuaries reflects the most recent data for mortality improvement grainger estimates this change could increase 2017 pretax earnings by approximately 06 million 

grainger updated the 2016 census for involuntary terminations that occurred in 2016 grainger estimates this change could increase 2017 pretax earnings by approximately 05 million 

as of december 31 2016 grainger adopted a new healthcare trend rate to include a pre and post age 65 trend rate the alternative trend rates allow for a better estimate of expected trends for this plan grainger estimates this change could decrease 2017 pretax earnings by approximately 18 million 

grainger uses the longterm historical return on the plan assets and the historical performance of the sp 500 and the total international composite index to develop its expected return on plan assets in 2016 the company increased the aftertax expected longterm rate of return on plan assets from 665 to 713 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return due to a change in the estimated tax rate this change was due to the nature of the taxable income earned on the investments in the group benefit trust and the applicable tax rates grainger estimates this change could increase 2017 pretax earnings by approximately 08 million 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and therefore may affect graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

 30 

income taxes    the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

contingent liabilities    at any time grainger may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against grainger such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability general negligence contract disputes environmental issues unclaimed property wage and hour laws intellectual property employment practices regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees consumers competitors suppliers or governmental entities grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation auto liability general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposures as appropriate for claims against grainger when losses become probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies where grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes graingers best estimate grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against grainger when losses are reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to graingers consolidated financial statements these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond graingers control if the assessment of any of these factors changes the estimates may change predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 

other      other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

 31 

effects of inflation and changing prices 

grainger is affected by inflation through increased product and operating costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to customers over time is dependent upon market conditions the ability to achieve sales growth through increased prices is also subject to inflation and normal competitive conditions the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements 

from time to time in this annual report on form 10k as well as in other written reports and verbal statements grainger makes forwardlooking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results business plans analyses prospects strategies objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws such forwardlooking statements are identified by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “expect” “could” “forecast” “may” “intend” “plan” “predict” “project” and similar terms and expressions 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond the companys control which could cause graingers results to differ materially from those that are presented 

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings including with respect to wage and hour antibribery and corruption environmental advertising privacy and cybersecurity matters investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions loss of key members of management the companys ability to operate integrate and leverage acquired businesses changes in credit ratings changes in effective tax rates and other factors identified under item 1a risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10k 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update any of its forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rates 

grainger’s financial results including the value of assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the international subsidiaries as stated in their local currencies are translated into us dollars while it is difficult to quantify any particular impact of changes in exchange rates a uniform 10 strengthening in the us dollar whereby all other variables are held constant and unusual expense items described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are excluded would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and a decrease of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2015 comparatively a 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and an increase of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2015  this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in future potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

interest rates 

grainger is subject to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt portfolio grainger may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage those risks based on graingers variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 5 million for 2016  and 3 million for 2015  a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 5 million for 2016  and 3 million for 2015  this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in future potential changes in longterm debt levels 

commodity price risk 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to graingers business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

weakness in the economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth economic and industry trends affect graingers business environments economic downturns can cause customers both domestic and international to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their purchases of graingers products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the united states canada or any other major world economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for graingers products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses that compete with price transparency the industry is also consolidating as customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations this consolidation could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by competitors or as competitors with new lower cost business models are able to operate with lower prices and gross profit on products these competitive pressures could adversely affect graingers sales and profitability 

changes in inflation may adversely affect gross margins  inflation impacts the costs at which grainger can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time prolonged periods of low inflation could adversely affect the degree to which grainger is able to increase sales through price increases 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins  some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs graingers ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations  graingers competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 4800 key suppliers located in various countries around the world no one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond graingers control such as economic downturns political unrest port slowdowns trade issues etc any of which could adversely affect a suppliers ability to manufacture or deliver products as grainger continues to source lower cost products from asia and other areas of the world the risk for disruptions has increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and graingers reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities and competition if rapid growth with large customers continues grainger will face pressure to maintain current gross margins as this customer segment receives discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future 

disruptions in graingers supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations  a disruption within graingers logistics or supply chain network including damage destruction extreme weather and other events which could cause one or more of the distribution centers to become nonoperational could adversely affect graingers ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner impair graingers ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to graingers reputation graingers ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of the business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact the results of operations

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of graingers information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems although graingers information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses computer viruses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things graingers ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of graingers information systems could also subject grainger to additional costs 

breaches of information systems security could damage graingers reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues through graingers sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores confidential information from customers so that they may among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs register on graingers websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company grainger also acquires and retains information about suppliers employees and others in the normal course of business despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information during the normal course of business grainger has experienced and expects to continue to experience attempts to breach the companys information systems and grainger may be unable to protect sensitive data andor the integrity of the companys information systems moreover from time to time grainger may share information with vendors and other third parties that assist with certain aspects of the business while grainger requires assurances that these vendors and other parties will protect confidential information there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised if successful those attempting to penetrate graingers or its vendors information systems may misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage graingers reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and others any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with evolving privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes grainger could be subject to liability for failure to comply with these laws and standards failure to protect information failure to respond appropriately to an incident or misuse of information including use of information for unauthorized marketing purposes 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations  grainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency while the consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of grainger’s subsidiaries outside the united states are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger’s international subsidiaries primarily the yen renminbi euro pound sterling and canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in reported results grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows 

acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations acquisitions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing the value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies there is a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business and of an inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition additionally problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies graingers operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

graingers continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of graingers reputation  one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of graingers brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish graingers brand and lead to adverse effects on graingers business 

graingers business is subject to various government regulations  graingers business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where it operates and compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business grainger is subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements antibribery and corruption laws tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries product compliance laws environmental laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions advertising regulations data privacy and cybersecurity requirements regulations and potential expansion of regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor laws and anticompetition regulations and is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business as a government contractor selling to federal state and local government entities grainger is also subject to a wide variety of additional laws and regulations changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation furthermore grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or graingers policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect graingers financial condition or operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

general  grainger is a broad line distributor of maintenance repair and operating supplies and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions grainger’s operations are primarily in the united states and canada with a presence also in europe asia and latin america grainger uses a combination of multichannel and single channel online business models to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives catalogs direct marketing materials and ecommerce grainger serves approximately 3  million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches distribution centers and websites 

grainger’s two reportable segments are the united states and canada the united states segment reflects the results of grainger’s us operating segment the canada segment reflects the results for acklands – grainger grainger’s canadian operating segment other businesses which include zoro and operations in europe asia and latin america are not material individually 

business environment  given graingers large number of customers and the diverse industries it serves   several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape grainger’s business environment the overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting grainger’s growth grainger’s sales in the united states and canada tend to positively correlate with business investment exports industrial production and gross domestic product gdp in the united states sales also tend to positively correlate with business inventory in canada sales also tend to positively correlate with oil prices the table below provides these estimated indicators for 2015 and 2016 



in the united states business investment and exports are two major indicators of mro spend equipment spending slowed in 2015 while many companies invested steadily firms directly and indirectly exposed to the oil and gas sector significantly reduced capital spending the nearly 10 appreciation of the us dollar during 2015 as measured by the federal reserve on a trade weighted basis contributed to us exports of industrial supplies and materials in november reaching their lowest levels in 5 years in the forecast equipment spending growth accelerates from 31 in 2015 to approximately 44 in 2016 as the drag from the stronger us dollar and low energy prices dissipates and companies invest at rates consistent with an economy growing at a 25–30 rate global insight expects the us dollar to continue to strengthen during 2016 but at a decelerating pace over the first half of the year mainly due to tightening monetary policy and accelerating us economic growth exports and imports are forecast to continue to be impacted by the stronger dollar in 2016 preventing overall growth from accelerating in 2016 

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised approximately 30 of grainger’s total 2015  sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production the us department of labor reported manufacturing employment levels were flat from december 2014 to december 2015  according to the federal reserve manufacturing output increased by only 08 from december 2014 to december 2015  these statistics were reflected in graingers sales performance in these sectors as total manufacturing sales were down in the low single digits primarily driven by the heavy manufacturing end market 

the canadian economy in 2015 suffered its worst economic performance since the global recession of 2009 the main reason for this weakness was the significant decline in oil prices that led to severely depressed investment in the energy sector the low oil prices also caused the value of the canadian dollar to fall relative to the us dollar leading to an increase in price inflation unfortunately the reduced energy prices and low canadian dollar were not enough to support the canadian manufacturing industry and export sectors which combined with the weakness in the energy sector led to a small recession in the first half of the year economic activity contracted by 07 in the first quarter and 025 in the second quarter economic growth in the second half of the year rebounded modestly and the canadian economy is now projected to have grown approximately 10 for 2015 in total ihs global insight no longer anticipates a quick recovery in oil prices though as the market adjusts supply and demand imbalances as a 

 14 

result an oilprice recovery will be delayed instead a more gradual climb in oil prices will keep real gdp growth at 20 or less through 2017 

the start of 2016 shows more evidence of weakness in the canadian economy the further drop in energy prices is taking a toll on canada with manufacturing output declining in the latest gdp report as such real gdp growth prospects have been lowered for 2016 to only 13 the low canadian dollar continues to put upward pressure on inflation and with a few exceptions the domestic economy faces many challenges the rapid deterioration of oil prices to levels not seen in over a decade continue to impact the performance of the canadian business which is heavily dependent on the natural resources sector   most analysts are forecasting little to no improvement in oil prices through at least the first half of 2016 

outlook  grainger plans to continue to execute changes in the us and canada in 2016 while continuing to make investments in its supply chain ecommerce capabilities information systems sales force productivity tools and inventory management services these investments will support the company’s revenue growth objectives of i continuing to grow its share of business with large complex customers ii creating a unique value proposition to further penetrate the medium customer segment and iii further leveraging its ecommerce capabilities to serve smaller customers through the execution of the restructuring initiatives in both the us and canada the company will reduce its cost base while ensuring that it continues to deliver an effortless customer experience 

on january 26 2016 grainger reiterated its 2016 earnings per share guidance of 1080 to 1300 and its 2016 sales guidance of 1 to 7 percent 

matters affecting comparability  grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2015  2014  and 2013 all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate grainger’s operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates 

results of operations

gross profit of  4231 million  for 2015  decreased 2 the gross profit margin for 2015  was 424  down 09  percentage point versus 2014  primarily driven by higher sales to lower margin customers and price deflation exceeding cost deflation 

operating expenses of  2931 million  for 2015  decreased 1 from  2967 million  for 2014  the decrease was primarily driven by lower employee benefits partially offset by higher severance and contract services costs operating expenses included an incremental 132 million in growthrelated spending on ecommerce new sales representatives supply chain and inventory management solutions as well as 42 million of charges primarily related to reorganizing the businesses in the united states and canada in 2014 operating expenses included 51 million related to the closing of the business in brazil restructuring costs and the transition of the retirement plan in europe and an impairment charge for the business in colombia excluding the reorganization and restructuring costs from both years operating expenses were down 1

net earnings attributable to grainger for 2015  decreased by 4 to  769 million  from  802 million  in 2014  the decrease in net earnings primarily resulted from lower operating earnings partially offset by lower income taxes diluted earnings per share of 1158 in 2015  were 1  higher than 1145 for 2014  due to lower average shares outstanding 

the table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states to adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names

income taxes of 522 million in 2014 increased 9 compared with 480 million in 2013 graingers effective tax rates were 391 and 373 in 2014 and 2013 respectively excluding the effect of the separately identified charges reported in both 2014 and 2013 graingers adjusted tax rate was 382 and 373 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in the tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the united states versus geographies with lower tax rates and losses with no tax benefit

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as to pay cash dividends 

cash flow 

2015 compared to 2014 

cash from operating activities continues to serve as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2015 were 990 million versus 960 million in 2014 cash flows from operations were higher in 2015 primarily due to a positive cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities versus 2014 this positive cash flow was due to relatively flat receivable balances partially offset by a decrease in employee benefit liabilities 

net cash used in investing activities was 843 million and 384 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively the higher use of cash was primarily driven by 464 million of net cash paid for business acquisition in 2015 versus 31 million in 2014 

net cash used in financing activities of 63 million in 2015 decreased 695 million from 758 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of 1 billion in senior notes a £160 million term loan and issuance of commercial paper to support the acquisition of cromwell as well as ¥6 billion term loans to support the construction of a new distribution center in japan these proceeds were partially offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock and dividends paid 

2014 compared to 2013 

cash from operating activities served as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2014 were 960 million versus 986 million in 2013 cash flows from operations were lower in 2014 primarily due to higher inventory purchases in 2014 compared to 2013 in 2013 the inventory position at the start of the year was higher due to lower sales in december 2012 as well as an inventory build to facilitate the move of graingers chicagoarea distribution center 

net cash used in investing activities was 384 million and 399 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the lower use of cash was primarily driven by acquisition activity less cash was spent on acquisitions in 2014 versus 2013 the lower use of cash from acquisition activity in 2014 was partially offset by more cash expended in 2014 for additions to property buildings and equipment primarily related to supply chain investments 

net cash used in financing activities of 758 million in 2014 increased 167 million from 591 million in 2013 the increase was primarily due to a partial repayment of the term loan in the united states as well as an increase in the purchase of treasury stock and dividends paid this was partially offset by proceeds from the new revolving credit facility in the canadian business 

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt in addition funds are expended to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

working capital consists of current assets less nonoperating cash and current liabilities less shortterm debt and current maturities of longterm debt working capital was 1794 million  at december 31 2015  compared with 1697 million  at december 31 2014  at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 25  and 25  respectively the increase in working capital was primarily related to higher receivable and inventory balances driven by the cromwell acquisition as well as lower liabilities for employees profit sharing plans 

 23 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 



in 2015 grainger continued investing in the north america distribution center network and the completion of the common erp platform for north america and made investments in support of sales initiatives other significant investments in 2015 included the ecommerce platform sustaining capital investments for graingers branches and distribution centers and other technology infrastructure 

in 2014 grainger made significant capital investments to build new distribution centers in the united states and canada in the united states grainger began the replacement of its existing new jersey distribution center with construction of a new 13 million squarefoot distribution center in canada grainger continued construction of the new distribution center in the toronto area grainger also invested in technology infrastructure vending machines for the keepstock program and normal recurring replacement of equipment 

in 2013 significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the united states and canada in the united states grainger opened a new 1 million squarefoot and highly automated chicagoarea distribution center in canada grainger began construction of the 535000 squarefoot distribution center in the toronto area other significant investments in 2013 included investing in a new ecommerce platform sustaining capital investments for graingers branches and distribution centers and other technology infrastructure 

in 2016 capital expenditures are expected to range from 300 million to 350 million projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain ecommerce inventory management solutions and in support of sales initiatives grainger expects to fund 2016  capital spending primarily from operating cash 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 458  and 129 as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

on april 16 2015 grainger announced plans to issue 18 billion in longterm debt over the next three years to partially fund the repurchase of 3 billion in shares the remaining amount is expected to be funded from internally generated cash in june 2015 grainger issued 1 billion in longterm debt which is the first of three expected debt issuances the new debt is payable in 30 years and carries a 460 interest rate payable semiannually with the new longterm debt grainger expects to maintain a debt to ebitda ratio in the 10–15x range ebitda which is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization is a nongaap measure and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner refer to note 7 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2015  graingers contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 



purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and employee benefits plans as determined by actuarial projections and other employee benefit plans other employmentrelated benefits costs of 59 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not predictable see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

see also note 8 and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately 66 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2015  this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements all significant contractual obligations are recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to graingers consolidated financial statements grainger has an investment in a variable interest entity vie for which grainger is not the primary beneficiary the vie is accounted for as an equity method investment see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in graingers results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of graingers financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

note 1  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts    grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable graingers estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for obsolete inventory grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 14 million stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves that could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets that affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment writedowns that may occur in future periods grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 

grainger completed the annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2015 including the quantitative test for fabory with 106 million of goodwill the fair value of the fabory reporting units goodwill exceeded the carrying value by 15 and the step two calculation was not required for this reporting unit the risk of potential failure of step one of the impairment test for fabory in future reporting periods is highly dependent upon key assumptions included in the determination of the reporting units fair value the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow dcf method and incorporating value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values the dcf method incorporates various assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future expected cash flows including revenues gross margins operating expenses capital expenditures and working capital based on operational budgets longrange strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period and reflects management’s best estimates for perpetual growth for the reporting units estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of 

 26 

capital are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value changes in assumptions regarding future performance and unfavorable economic environment in europe may also have a significant impact on cash flows in the future grainger performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the reasonableness of the step one results and evaluated the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate no indications of impairment resulted from this sensitivity analysis given the sensitivity of the calculated fair value to changes in these key assumptions grainger may be required to recognize an impairment for fabory’s goodwill in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to these key assumptions 

stock incentive plans    grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted used the following assumptions 



the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of graingers stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant because the expense for other stockbased awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

postretirement healthcare benefits     the postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on graingers postretirement benefit obligation and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year    a higher discount rate reduces the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs   as of december 31 2015  grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 389 to 420 to reflect the increase in market interest rates    grainger estimates that this increase could increase 2016 pretax earnings by approximately 12 million    however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2015  results in thousands of dollars 



grainger changed the mortality improvement table used to project mortality rates into the future from mortality table rp2014 with mortality improvement scale mp2014 to mortality table rph2014 with mortality improvement scale mp2015 at december 31 2015 mortality table rph2014 is a headcountweighted table that is more appropriate for the measurement of other postretirement employee benefit plans scale mp2015 published by the society of actuaries reflects the most recent data for mortality improvement grainger estimates this change could increase 2016 pretax earnings by approximately 13 million 

grainger updated the 2015 census for involuntary terminations that occurred in 2015 grainger estimates this change could increase 2016 pretax earnings by approximately 11 million 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and therefore may affect graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 28 

insurance reserves  grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation auto liability general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels in calculating the liability historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current periods results of operations grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied there were no material adjustments based on graingers historical experience in 2015 2014 and 2013  if actual trends including the nature severity or frequency of claims differ from graingers estimates or if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes    the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

contingent liabilities    at any time grainger may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against grainger such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability general negligence contract disputes environmental issues wage and hour laws intellectual property employment practices regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees consumers competitors suppliers or governmental entities grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure as appropriate for claims against grainger when losses become probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies where grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes graingers best estimate grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against grainger when losses are reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to graingers consolidated financial statements these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond graingers control if the assessment of any of these factors changes the estimates may change predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 

other      other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

 29 

effects of inflation and changing prices 

grainger is affected by inflation through increased product and operating costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to customers over time is dependent upon market conditions the ability to achieve sales growth through increased prices is also subject to inflation and normal competitive conditions the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements 

from time to time in this annual report on form 10k as well as in other written reports and verbal statements grainger makes forwardlooking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results business plans analyses prospects strategies objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws such forwardlooking statements are identified by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “expect” “could” “forecast” “may” “intend” “plan” “predict” “project” and similar terms and expressions 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond the companys control which could cause graingers results to differ materially from those which are presented 

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings including with respect to wage and hour antibribery and corruption environmental advertising privacy and cybersecurity matters investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions loss of key members of management the companys ability to operate integrate and leverage acquired businesses and the factors identified under item 1a risk factors and elsewhere in the form 10k 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 30 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 9 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on graingers derivative activities 

foreign currency exchange rates 

grainger’s financial results including the value of assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the international subsidiaries as stated in their local currencies are translated into us dollars while it is difficult to quantify any particular impact of changes in exchange rates a uniform 10 strengthening in the us dollar whereby all other variables are held constant and unusual expense items described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are excluded would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of 1 million and 4 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively comparatively a 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of 1 million and 5 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in future potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

interest rates 

grainger is subject to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt portfolio grainger may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage those risks based on graingers variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 3 million for 2015 and 2 million for 2014 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 3 million for 2015 and 2 million for 2014 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in future potential changes in longterm debt levels 

commodity price risk 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to graingers business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

weakness in the economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth economic and industry trends affect graingers business environments economic downturns can cause customers both domestic and international to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their purchases of graingers products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the united states canada or any other major world economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for graingers products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses the industry is also consolidating as customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of consistent sources of supply   competitive pressures could adversely affect graingers sales and profitability 

changes in inflation may adversely affect gross margins  inflation impacts the costs at which grainger can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time prolonged periods of low inflation could adversely affect the degree to which grainger is able to recover inflationary costs or increase sales through price escalation 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins  some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market increases in the price of fuel could also drive up transportation costs graingers ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations  graingers competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 4500 key suppliers located in various countries around the world no one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond graingers control such as economic downturns political unrest port slowdowns trade issues etc any of which could adversely affect a suppliers ability to manufacture or deliver products as grainger continues to source lower cost products from asia and other areas of the world the risk for disruptions has increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and graingers reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer and product mix that effect gross margin changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities and competition if rapid growth with large customers continues grainger will face pressure to maintain current gross margins as this customer segment receives discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future 

disruptions in graingers supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations  a disruption within graingers logistics or supply chain network including damage destruction extreme weather and other events which would cause one or more of the distribution centers to become nonoperational could adversely affect graingers ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner impair graingers ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to graingers reputation graingers ability to provide sameday shipping and nextday delivery is an integral component of the business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact the results of operations 

 7 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of graingers information systems including its websites is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems and websites although graingers information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses computer viruses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things graingers ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of graingers information systems could also subject grainger to additional costs 

breaches of information systems security could damage graingers reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues through graingers sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on the website grainger also acquires and retains information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information computer hackers may attempt to penetrate graingers or its vendors information systems and if successful misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage graingers reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations  grainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency while the consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of grainger’s subsidiaries outside the united states are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger’s international subsidiaries could cause fluctuations in reported results grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary’s functional currency and could have an impact on sales costs and cash flows 

acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations acquisitions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing the value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies there is a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business and of an inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition additionally problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired 

 8 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies graingers operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

graingers continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of graingers reputation  one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of graingers brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish graingers brand and lead to adverse effects on graingers business 

graingers business is subject to various government regulations  graingers business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where it operates and compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business grainger is subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements the foreign corrupt practices act tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements regulations and potential expansion of regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor laws and anticompetition regulations and is also subject to audits and inquiries in the ordinary course of business as a government contractor selling to federal state and local government entities grainger is also subject to a wide variety of additional laws and regulations changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation furthermore grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or graingers policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect graingers financial condition or operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

general  grainger is a broadline distributor of maintenance repair and operating supplies and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions grainger’s operations are primarily in the united states and canada with presence also in europe asia and latin america grainger uses a combination of multichannel and single channel online business models to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives catalogs direct marketing materials and ecommerce grainger serves more than 2  million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches distribution centers and websites 

grainger’s two reportable segments are the united states and canada the united states segment reflects the results of grainger’s us operating segment the canada segment reflects the results for acklands – grainger grainger’s canadian operating segment other businesses which include zoro and operations in europe asia and latin america are not material individually 

business environment  given graingers large number of customers and the diverse industries it serves   several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape grainger’s business environment the overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting grainger’s growth grainger’s sales in the united states and canada tend to positively correlate with gross domestic product gdp industrial production exports and business investment in the united states sales also tend to positively correlate with business inventory in canada sales also tend to positively correlate with oil prices the table below provides these estimated indicators for 2014 and 2015 



in the united states business investment and exports are two major indicators of mro spend after growing 11 for two straight quarters business investment slowed to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2014 according to global insight however given the economys momentum at the end of 2014 as demonstrated through the november and december employment reports business spending is expected to rebound in the first quarter of 2015 however investment in equipment is expected to face headwinds if weak foreign demand continues export growth is expected to remain in the low singledigits due to subpar world growth and a strong us dollar 

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised approximately 30 of grainger’s total 2014  sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production the united states department of labor reported an increase of 15 in manufacturing employment levels from december 2013 to december 2014  according to the federal reserve manufacturing output increased 49 from december 2013 to december 2014  these increases contributed to a high singledigit percent sales increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a mid singledigit percent sales increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for grainger in 2014 

while full year 2014 economic growth for canada was positive the canadian economy experienced pressure throughout the year as the canadian dollar weakened to new fiveyear lows versus the us dollar the weak canadian dollar combined with a 1 drop in the commodity price index for metals and minerals from december 2013 to december 2014 have impacted the performance of the canadian business which is heavily dependent on the natural resources sector these market factors led to declines in the agriculture and mining sectors for the canadian business in 2014 in addition the recent decline of oil prices has caused investment in canadas oil and gas industries to slow according to the royal bank of canada 

outlook  in 2015 grainger plans to continue to make investments in its supply chain information systems ecommerce sales force and inventory management services these investments are expected to accelerate market share growth and increase graingers size and scale 

 14 

on january 26 2015 grainger revised its 2015 earnings per share guidance from a range of 1290 to 1380 to a range of 1260 to 1360 and also revised its 2015 sales guidance from a range of 5 to 9 percent to a range of 3 to 7 percent this change is driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and the weak economy in canada 

matters affecting comparability 

grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2014  2013  and 2012 all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate grainger’s operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates 

results of operations

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 9 million of expense in 2013 compared with 13 million of expense in 2012 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 



net interest expense decreased in 2013 due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average outstanding debt 

income taxes 

income taxes of 480 million in 2013 increased 15 as compared with 419 million in 2012 graingers reported tax rates were 373 and 375 in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as to pay cash dividends 

cash flow 

2014 compared to 2013 

cash from operating activities continues to serve as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2014 were 960 million versus 986 million in 2013 cash flows from operations were lower in 2014 primarily due to higher inventory purchases in 2014 compared to 2013 in 2013 the inventory position at the start of the year was higher due to lower sales in december 2012 as well as an inventory build to facilitate the move of graingers chicagoarea distribution center 

net cash used in investing activities was 384 million and 399 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the lower use of cash was primarily driven by acquisition activity less cash was spent on acquisitions in 2014 versus 2013 the lower use of cash from acquisition activity in 2014 was partially offset by more cash expended in 2014 for additions to property buildings and equipment primarily related to supply chain investments 

net cash used in financing activities of 758 million in 2014 increased 167 million from 591 million in 2013 the increase was primarily due to a partial repayment of the term loan in the united states as well as an increase in the purchase of treasury stock and dividends paid this was partially offset by proceeds from the new revolving credit facility in the canadian business 

2013 compared to 2012 

cash from operating activities served as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2013 were 986 million and increased 170 million from 816 million in 2012 the primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of 109 million in addition changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net use of cash of 58 million for 2013 compared to 129 million for 2012 the lower use of cash for operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher trade accounts payable due to higher inventory purchases at yearend in 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by higher accounts receivable from increased sales 

net cash used in investing activities was 399 million and 306 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively the higher use of cash in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by the increased cash paid for acquisitions and cash expended for property buildings equipment and software 

 21 

net cash used in financing activities of 591 million in 2013 increased 197 million from 394 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher treasury share repurchases cash paid for treasury share purchases was 438 million in 2013 versus 341 million in 2012 an increase of 97 million the prior year also included 300 million in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt in addition funds are expended to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

working capital consists of current assets less nonoperating cash and current liabilities less shortterm debt and current maturities of longterm debt working capital was 1697 million  at december 31 2014  compared with 1621 million  at december 31 2013  at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 24  and 25  respectively the increase in working capital was primarily related to higher receivable balances driven by sales volume and an increase in extended terms given to customers 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 



in 2014 grainger made significant capital investments to build new distribution centers in the united states and canada in the united states grainger began construction of a new 13 million squarefoot distribution center in new jersey in canada grainger continued construction of the new distribution center in the toronto area grainger also invested in technology infrastructure vending machines for the keepstock program and normal recurring replacement of equipment 

in 2013 and 2012 significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the united states and canada in the united states grainger opened a new 1 million squarefoot and highly automated chicagoarea distribution center in 2013 in canada grainger began construction of the 535000 squarefoot distribution center in the toronto area other significant investments in 2013 and 2012 included investing in a new ecommerce platform sustaining capital investments for graingers branches and distribution centers and other technology infrastructure 

in 2015 capital expenditures are expected to range from 375 million to 425 million projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain technology infrastructure ecommerce and in support of sales initiatives grainger expects to fund 2015  capital spending from operating cash 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit refer to note 6  and note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 129  and 140 as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to the partial repayment of the term loan in the united states in 2014 grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 

 22 

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2014  graingers contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 



purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and employee benefits plans as determined by actuarial projections and other employee benefit plans other employmentrelated benefits costs of 59 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not predictable see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

see also note 7  and note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately 49 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2014  this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in graingers results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of graingers financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

note 1  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts    grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable graingers estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for obsolete inventory grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 14 million stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment writedowns that may occur in future periods grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and performs a qualitative assessment of factors such as a reporting units current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test in the twostep test grainger compares the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit to its calculated fair value if the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value the second step is performed where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of assets to determine the amount of impairment 

 24 

the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow dcf method and incorporating value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values the dcf method incorporates various assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows including revenues gross margins operating expenses capital expenditures and working capital based on operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period and reflects management’s best estimates for perpetual growth for the reporting units estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value 

grainger completed the annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2014 and identified two reporting units for which it could not determine whether or not the fair value would be less than the carrying value for one of these reporting units grainger colombia the twostep quantitative test indicated that the carrying value of assets exceeded the calculated fair value and step two impairment calculations were required during the testing in the fourth quarter grainger considered management’s revised outlook on the business which included lower projected sales growth and incremental investment necessary to execute on the strategy grainger incorporated this revised outlook into the twostep quantitative test resulting in lowered projected sales growth operating earnings and cash flows grainger recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of 12 million on the grainger colombia reporting unit 

fabory with 118 million of goodwill had a calculated fair value which exceeded the carrying value of assets by 31 and step two calculations were not required for this reporting unit the risk of potential failure of step one of the impairment test for fabory in future reporting periods is highly dependent upon key assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows sales growth rates gross margins capital expenditures discount rates and estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc these assumptions require considerable management judgment and are subject to uncertainty grainger performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the reasonableness of the step one results and evaluated the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate no indications of impairment resulted from this sensitivity analysis changes in assumptions regarding future performance and a continued unfavorable economic environment in europe may also have a significant impact on cash flows in the future given the sensitivity of the calculated fair value to changes in these key assumptions grainger may be required to recognize an impairment for fabory’s goodwill in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to these key assumptions 

for grainger’s remaining reporting units the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values 

 25 

stock incentive plans    grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted used the following assumptions 



the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of graingers stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant because the expense for other stockbased awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements 

postretirement healthcare benefits     the postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on graingers postretirement benefit obligation and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year    a higher discount rate reduces the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs   as of december 31 2014  grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 490 to 389 to reflect the decrease in market interest rates    grainger estimates that this decrease could decrease 2015 pretax earnings by approximately 44 million    however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poors 500 index and the total international composite index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2014  grainger increased the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets from 570 net of tax to 665 net of tax based on the historical average of longterm rates of return net of estimated tax rates grainger estimates this change could increase 2015 pretax earnings by approximately 15 million 

 26 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2014  results in thousands of dollars 



grainger changed the mortality improvement table used to project mortality rates into the future from mortality table rp2000 with mortality improvement scale bb to mortality table rp2014 with mortality improvement scale mp 2014 at december 31 2014 which was published by the society of actuaries in october 2014 and reflects longer life expectancies than under the previous table and scale grainger estimates this change could reduce 2015 pretax earnings by approximately 09 million 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and therefore may affect graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

insurance reserves  grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation auto liability general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels in calculating the liability historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current periods results of operations grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied there were no material adjustments based on graingers historical experience in 2014 2013 and 2012  if actual trends including the nature severity or frequency of claims differ from graingers estimates or if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes    grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

 27 

contingent liabilities    at any time grainger may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against grainger such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability general negligence contract disputes environmental issues wage and hour laws intellectual property employment practices regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees consumers competitors suppliers or governmental entities grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure as appropriate for claims against grainger when losses become probable and reasonably estimable where grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes graingers best estimate grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against grainger when losses are reasonably possible and material these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond graingers control 

other      other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation and changing prices 

grainger is affected by inflation through increased product and operating costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to customers over time is dependent upon market conditions the ability to achieve sales growth through increased prices is also subject to inflation and normal competitive conditions the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws such forwardlooking statements are identified by words such as “anticipate estimate expect forecast intend plan predict and project” or similar expressions and include graingers expected earnings per share sales growth and capital expenditures 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause graingers results to differ materially from those which are presented 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages litigation involving appropriate payment for wages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 29 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 8  and note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on graingers derivative activities 

foreign currency exchange rates 

grainger’s financial results including the value of assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the international subsidiaries as stated in their local currencies are translated into us dollars while it is difficult to quantify any particular impact of changes in exchange rates a uniform 10 strengthening in the us dollar whereby all other variables are held constant and unusual expense items described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are excluded would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of 4 million and 8 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively comparatively a 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of 5 million and 10 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in future potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

interest rates 

grainger is subject to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt portfolio grainger may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage those risks based on graingers variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 2 million for 2014 and 3 million for 2013 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 2 million for 2014 and 3 million for 2013 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in future potential changes in longterm debt levels 

commodity price risk 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to graingers business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

weakness in the economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth economic and industry trends affect graingers business environments economic downturns can cause customers both domestic and international to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase graingers products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the united states canada or any other major world economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for graingers products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses competitive pressures could adversely affect graingers sales and profitability 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins  some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market increases in the price of fuel could also drive up transportation costs graingers ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower operating margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations  graingers competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 5000 key suppliers located in various countries around the world no one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond graingers control such as economic downturns political unrest trade issues etc any of which could adversely affect a suppliers ability to manufacture or deliver products if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and graingers reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger were unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline from time to time grainger experiences changes in customer and product mix that effect gross margin changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions changes in customer demand customer acquisitions selling and marketing activities and competition if rapid growth with large customers continues grainger will face pressure to maintain current gross margins as this customer segment receives discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future 

disruptions in graingers supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations  a disruption within graingers logistics or supply chain network including damage destruction and other events which would cause one or more of the distribution centers to become nonoperational could adversely affect graingers ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner impair graingers ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to graingers reputation such a disruption could adversely impact the results of operations 

 6 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of graingers information systems including its websites is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems and websites although graingers information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses computer viruses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things graingers ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of graingers information systems could also subject grainger to additional costs 

breaches of information systems security could damage graingers reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues through graingers sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on the website grainger also acquires and retains information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information computer hackers may attempt to penetrate graingers or its vendors information systems and if successful misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage graingers reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations  foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations have an impact on sales costs and cash flows from international operations and could affect reported financial performance 

acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations acquisitions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing the value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies there is a risk of potential losses of key employees of an acquired business and of an inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition additionally problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies graingers operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

graingers continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of graingers reputation  one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of graingers brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish graingers brand and lead to adverse effects on graingers business

business environment  given graingers large number of customers and the diverse industries it serves   several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape grainger’s business environment the overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting grainger’s growth grainger’s sales in the united states and canada tend to positively correlate with gross domestic product gdp industrial production exports and business investment in the united states sales also tend to positively correlate with business inventory the table below provides these estimated indicators for 2013 and 2014 



the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised approximately 30 of grainger’s total 2013  sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels in the united states increased approximately 06  from december 2012 to december 2013  while manufacturing output increased 26  these increases contributed to a high singledigit percent sales increase in the light manufacturing customer sector and a mid singledigit percent sales increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector for grainger in 2013 

as oil production represents a large segment of the canadian economy fluctuations in crude oil prices can have a significant impact on the sales and business conditions in graingers canadian business according to the us energy information administration crude oil prices increased from 88 to 98 per barrel or an 11 increase from december 2012 to december 2013 

outlook  in 2014 grainger plans to continue to make investments in its supply chain ecommerce sales force and inventory management services these investments are expected to accelerate market share growth and increase graingers size and scale grainger is also taking appropriate steps to strengthen areas of the business that are not performing to expectations 

on january 24 2014 grainger revised its 2014 earnings per share guidance from a range of 1225 to 1300 to a range of 1210 to 1285 and also revised its 2014 sales guidance from a range of 6 to 10 percent to a range of 5 to 9 percent this change is primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and the divestiture of the four direct marketing brands which were sold on december 31 2013

the following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

united states 

net sales were 6926 million for 2012 an increase of 425 million or 7 when compared with net sales of 6501 million for 2011 the 7 increase for the year consisted of the following contributors 



sales to all customer end markets increased for 2012 the increase was led by growth in sales to heavy and light manufacturing customers followed by diversified commercial services customers 

the segment gross profit margin increased 03 percentage point in 2012 over 2011 primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by customer mix 

operating expenses were up 8 for 2012 versus 2011 the 2012 year included a 76 million expense related to the settlement of disputes involving the gsa and usps contracts   also included was 10 million of expense primarily related to branch closure costs and an impairment charge for grainger lighting services the 2011 year included costs for the closure of 35 branches of 18 million excluding these expenses from both years operating expenses increased 4 primarily driven by an incremental 70 million in growthrelated spending on new sales representatives ecommerce and advertising 

for the segment operating earnings of 1133 million for 2012 increased 6 over 1066 million in 2011 excluding the expenses mentioned above in both years operating earnings were up 12 the improvement in operating earnings for 2012 was due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales 

 18 

canada 

net sales were 1106 million for 2012 an increase of 113 million or 11 when compared with 993 million for 2011 in local currency sales increased 12 for 2012 the 11 increase for the year consisted of the following contributors 



the increase in net sales was led by growth to oil and gas commercial and construction customers 

the segment gross profit margin increased 02 percentage point in 2012 over 2011 primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by unfavorable customer and product mix 

  

operating expenses increased 9 in 2012 in local currency operating expenses increased 10 primarily due to higher volumerelated payroll and travel costs and higher advertising and depreciation expense partially offset by lower occupancy costs 

operating earnings of 127 million for 2012 were up 20 million or 18 versus 2011 in local currency operating earnings increased 19 the increase in earnings was due to strong sales growth an improved gross profit margin and expense leverage 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses which include operations in europe asia latin america and other us operations were up 55 for 2012 the sales increase was due primarily to a full year of sales from fabory acquired in august 2011 and incremental sales from anfreixo acquired in april 2012 as well as strong growth from the businesses in japan and mexico 

operating earnings for other businesses were 20 million for 2012 compared to 31 million for 2011 the decrease was primarily due to restructuring charges related to improving the longterm performance of the businesses in europe india and china excluding these charges operating earnings were up 3 million primarily driven by improved performance in japan and mexico partially offset by losses from the acquired businesses in europe and brazil along with losses in some startup businesses in developing markets 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 13 million of expense in 2012 compared with 1 million of expense in 2011 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 



net interest expense increased in 2012 due to higher average outstanding debt higher average interest rates and interest expense related to capital leases for the acquired business in europe 

in 2011 grainger divested its 49 ownership in the mro korea co ltd joint venture   resulting in a gain of approximately 8 million 

 19 

income taxes 

income taxes of 419 million in 2012 increased 9 as compared with 385 million in 2011 graingers effective tax rates were 375 and 366 in 2012 and 2011 respectively the 2011 rate benefited from a tax law change in japan and the settlement of various tax reviews excluding these benefits in 2011 the effective tax rate was 381 the effective tax rate in 2012 benefited primarily from a lower blended state tax rate 

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as to pay cash dividends 

cash flow 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

cash from operating activities continues to serve as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2013 were 986 million and increased 170 million from 816 million in 2012 the primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of 109 million in addition changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net use of cash of 58 million for 2013 compared to 129 million for 2012 the lower use of cash for operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher trade accounts payable due to higher inventory purchases at yearend in 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by higher accounts receivable from increased sales 

net cash used in investing activities was 399 million and 306 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively the higher use of cash in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by the increased cash paid for acquisitions and cash expended for property buildings equipment and software 

net cash used in financing activities of 591 million in 2013 increased 197 million from 394 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher treasury share repurchases cash paid for treasury share purchases was 438 million in 2013 versus 341 million in 2012 an increase of 97 million the prior year also included 300 million in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

cash from operating activities served as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2012 were 816 million and increased 70 million from 746 million in 2011 the primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of 32 million as well as an increase of 34 million in net noncash expenses 

net cash used in investing activities of 306 million in 2012 was driven by net cash expended for property buildings equipment and software of 241 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of 65 million additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures  section below net cash used in investing activities was 229 million less than in 2011 due primarily to a decrease in net cash paid for business acquisitions of 294 million versus 2011 

net cash used in financing activities of 394 million in 2012 increased 217 million from 177 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher treasury shares repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2012 versus 2011 cash paid for treasury share purchases was 341 million in 2012 versus 151 million in 2011 an increase of 190 million cash dividends paid were 220 million in 2012 an increase of 39 million versus 2011 

 20 

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt in addition funds are expended to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

working capital consists of current assets less nonoperating cash and current liabilities less shortterm debt and current maturities of longterm debt working capital was 1621 million  at december 31 2013  compared with 1604 million  at december 31 2012  at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 25  and 26  respectively 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 



in 2013 and 2012 grainger made significant capital investments to build new distribution centers in the united states and canada in the united states grainger opened a new 1 million squarefoot and highly automated chicagoarea distribution center in 2013 in canada grainger began construction of a 500000 squarefoot distribution center in the toronto area grainger also invested in vending machines for keepstock as this program continues to grow other significant investments in 2013 and 2012 included investing in a new ecommerce platform sustaining capital investments for graingers branches and distribution centers and other technology infrastructure 

in 2011 significant expenditures were made to build new distribution centers in the united states and for distribution center expansion in canada also a large investment was made to update and improve the ecommerce platform in the united states business finally grainger continued to invest in new and existing international businesses as well as for normal recurring replacement of equipment 

in 2014 capital expenditures are expected to range from 375 million to 425 million projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain technology infrastructure ecommerce and in support of sales initiatives grainger expects to fund 2014  capital spending from operating cash 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit refer to note 6  and note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 140  and 153 as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to increased retained earnings associated with higher earnings in 2013  grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 

 21 

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2013  graingers contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 



purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and employee benefits plans as determined by actuarial projections and other employee benefit plans other employmentrelated benefits costs of 50 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not predictable see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

see also note 7  and note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately 44 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2013  this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

 22 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in graingers results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of graingers financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

note 1  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts    grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable graingers estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for obsolete inventory grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 14 million stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment writedowns that may occur in future periods grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and performs a qualitative assessment of factors such as a reporting units current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test in the twostep test grainger compares the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit to its calculated fair value if the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value the second step is performed where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of assets to determine the amount of impairment 

 23 

the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow dcf method and incorporating value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values the dcf method incorporates various assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows including revenues gross margins operating expenses capital expenditures and working capital based on operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period and reflects management’s best estimates for perpetual growth for the reporting units estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value 

grainger completed the annual impairment testing using the qualitative approach for seven reporting units and the twostep quantitative test for four of these reporting units during the fourth quarter for two of these reporting units grainger lighting services gls and grainger brazil gb the twostep quantitative test indicated that the carrying value of assets exceeded the calculated fair value and step two impairment calculations were required as part of the review of the strategic plans for gls during the fourth quarter grainger evaluated the impact of planned changes to the business model and level of investment in the business grainger’s estimates of future projected sales growth operating earnings and cash flows were revised to reflect lower estimates for new customers and projects as a result of the lower projections grainger recognized impairment charges of 13 million on the gls reporting unit 

during the fourth quarter management provided strategic plans which included changes to the business model and level of investment required for gb based on insights gained from owning the business since the acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 grainger’s assumptions were revised to reflect changes related to realization of expected deal synergies and anticipated shortterm and longterm operating results of gb that were different from preacquisition projections as a result of the lower performance expectations grainger’s estimates for future projected sales growth operating earnings and cash flows were revised accordingly these lowered expectations as well as an increase in relevant risk factors that increased the discount rate used in the calculations resulted in the calculated fair value of gb being lower than the carrying value of assets in the step one analysis as a result of the completion of step two grainger recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 11 million 

for the two other reporting units the fair values calculated in the step one analysis exceeded the carrying value of assets and therefore the step two calculation was not required fabory with 134 million of goodwill had a calculated fair value which exceeded the carrying value of assets by 17 the risk of potential failure of step one of the impairment test for fabory in future reporting periods is highly dependent upon key assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows sales growth rates gross margins capital expenditures discount rates and estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc these assumptions require considerable management judgment and are subject to uncertainty changes in assumptions regarding the future performance and a continued unfavorable economic environment in europe may also have a significant impact on cash flows in the future given the sensitivity of the calculated fair value to changes in these key assumptions grainger may be required to recognize an impairment for fabory’s goodwill in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to these key assumptions 

grainger colombia with 14 million of goodwill had a calculated fair value which exceeded the carrying value of assets by 26 as of the test date 

 24 

stock incentive plans    grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted used the following assumptions 



the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of graingers stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant because the expense for other stockbased awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements 

postretirement healthcare benefits     postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on graingers postretirement benefit obligation and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year    a higher discount rate reduces the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs   as of december 31 2013  grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 40 to 49 to reflect the increase in market interest rates    grainger estimates that this increase could increase 2014 pretax earnings by approximately 4 million    however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poors 500 index and the total international composite index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2013  grainger decreased the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets from 60 net of tax to 57 net of tax based on the historical average of longterm rates of return grainger estimates this change could reduce 2014 pretax earnings by approximately 04 million 

the company ’ s healthcare trend rate is selected based on historical experience and expected experience grainger changed the duration of the healthcare trend rate from an assumed rate of increase of 75 declining 50 basis points a year until reaching the ultimate trend rate of 5 to an assumed rate of increase of 75 declining 25 basis points a year until reaching the ultimate trend rate of 45 grainger estimates this change could reduce 2014 pretax earnings by approximately 1 million 

 25 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2013  results in thousands of dollars 



grainger changed the mortality improvement scale used to project mortality rates into the future from mortality improvement scale aa to mortality improvement scale bb at december 31 2013 grainger estimates this change could reduce 2014 pretax earnings by approximately 2 million  

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and therefore may affect graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

insurance reserves  grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels in calculating the liability historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current periods results of operations grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied there were no material adjustments based on graingers historical experience in 2013 2012 and 2011  if actual trends including the nature severity or frequency of claims differ from graingers estimates or if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes    grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

 26 

contingent liabilities    at any time grainger may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against grainger such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability general negligence contract disputes environmental issues wage and hour laws intellectual property employment practices regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees consumers competitors suppliers or governmental entities grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure as appropriate for claims against grainger when losses become probable and reasonably estimable where grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes graingers best estimate grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against grainger when losses are reasonably possible and material these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond graingers control 

other      other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

 27 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws grainger has generally identified such forwardlooking statements by using words such as “ anticipated assumed assumes assumptions believe believes can continue continued continues could estimate estimated estimates expect expectation expectations expected expects forecasted forecasts guidance if intended intends maintain maintains may might no assurance plans predict predictable presumption project projected projecting projections potential potentially reasonably likely risk scheduled should tend unanticipated will and would” or similar expressions 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause graingers results to differ materially from those which are presented 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages litigation involving appropriate payment for wages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 8  and note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on graingers derivative activities 

foreign currency exchange rates 

graingers international subsidiaries generate revenue and expenses in their local currencies grainger  s consolidated earnings are subject to foreign currency translation exposure upon conversion of a foreign entitys statement of earnings from the functional currency to the reporting currency which is the us dollar for 2013 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect graingers international subsidiaries would have resulted in a 6 million decrease in net earnings comparatively in 2012 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect graingers international subsidiaries would have resulted in a 7 million decrease in net earnings a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 7 million increase in net earnings for 2013 as compared with an increase in net earnings of 8 million for 2012 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in future potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

interest rates 

grainger is subject to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt portfolio grainger may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage those risks based on graingers variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 3 million for 2013 and 2 million for 2012 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 3 million for 2013 and 2 million for 2012 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in future potential changes in longterm debt levels 

commodity price risk 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to graingers business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

weakness in the economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth economic and industry trends affect graingers business environments economic downturns can cause customers both domestic and international to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase graingers products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the united states canada or any other major world economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for graingers products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses competitive pressures could adversely affect graingers sales and profitability 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins  some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market increases in the price of fuel could also drive up transportation costs graingers ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower operating margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations  graingers competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 4600 key suppliers located in various countries around the world no one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond graingers control such as economic downturns political unrest trade issues etc any of which could adversely affect a suppliers ability to manufacture or deliver products if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and graingers reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger were unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth  grainger is continuing in a multiyear product line expansion program the continued success of this program is expected to be a driver of growth its success will depend on graingers ability to accurately forecast market demand obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain as such there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

disruptions in graingers supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations  a disruption within graingers logistics or supply chain network including damage destruction and other events which would cause one or more of the distribution centers to become nonoperational could adversely affect graingers ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner impair graingers ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to graingers reputation such a disruption could adversely impact the results of operations 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of graingers information systems including its websites is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems and websites although graingers information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses computer viruses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things graingers ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of graingers information systems could also subject grainger to additional costs 

breaches of information systems security could damage graingers reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues through graingers sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in 

promotional programs and register on the website grainger also acquires and retains information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information computer hackers may attempt to penetrate graingers or its vendors information systems and if successful misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage graingers reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations  foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations have an impact on sales costs and cash flows from international operations and could affect reported financial performance 

acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations acquisitions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing the value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies there is a risk of potential losses of key employees of an acquired business and of an inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition additionally problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies graingers operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

graingers continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of graingers reputation  one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of graingers brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish graingers brand and lead to adverse effects on graingers business 

graingers business is subject to various government regulations  graingers business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where it operates and compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business grainger is subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements the foreign corrupt practices act tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition regulations and is also subject to audits and inquiries in the ordinary course of business as a government contractor selling to federal state and local government entities grainger is also subject to a wide variety of additional laws and regulations changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation furthermore grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or graingers policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect graingers financial condition or operating results

business environment  several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape grainger’s business environment the overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting grainger’s growth grainger’s sales tend to correlate with gross domestic product gdp industrial production exports business investment business inventory for the united states and oil prices for canada the table below provides these estimated indicators for 2012 and 2013 



the bureau of economic analysis reported the gdp advance estimate released on january 30 2013 decreased at an annual rate of 01 in the fourth quarter of 2012 graingers results reflected this as sales growth slowed in the fourth quarter particularly with a sudden decrease in sales the last third of december sequentially graingers sales growth declined in each of the four quarters of 2012 

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised approximately 27 of grainger’s total 2012  sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels in the united states increased approximately 15  from december 2011 to december 2012  while manufacturing output increased 15  these increases contributed to a low doubledigit percent increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a high singledigit percent increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for grainger in 2012  

outlook  during 2013 grainger plans to continue to make investments in growth drivers such as sales force and product line expansion ecommerce inventory management services and international expansion 

while indicators on a macro basis point to a softer economy in 2013 grainger believes it will continue to outperform these metrics on january 24 2013 grainger reiterated the 2013 earnings per share guidance of 1085 to 1200 and raised the 2013 sales guidance to a new range of 3 to 9 percent growth graingers previous 2013 sales guidance was 2 to 8 percent growth issued on november 14 2012 the increase in sales guidance reflects the december 31 2012 acquisition of technitool inc which had sales of 88 million in 2011 

matters affecting comparability  there were 255 sales days in 2012  255 in 2011  and 254 in 2010  

grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2012  and 2011  all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate grainger’s operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates

operating earnings of  1131 million  for 2012  increased 7  from  1052 million  for 2011  excluding the expenses mentioned above for both years operating earnings increased 15 primarily due to higher sales and gross profit margins and operating expenses increasing at a slightly slower rate than sales 

net earnings attributable to grainger for 2012  increased by 5  to  690 million  from  658 million  in 2011  the increase in net earnings primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings diluted earnings per share of 952 in 2012  were 5  higher than 907 for 2011  due to increased net earnings 

the table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states to adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names

the table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states to adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names 



segment analysis 

the following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings see note 16  to the consolidated financial statements 

united states 

net sales were 6501 million for 2011 an increase of 481 million or 8 when compared with net sales of 6020 million for 2010 the 8 daily increase for the year consisted of the following contributors 



sales to all customer endmarkets except one increased for 2011 the overall increase in net sales was led by a midteen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a high singledigit increase to light manufacturing customers the agriculture and mining customer endmarket declined due to the difficult comparisons from the oil spill in 2010 

the segment gross profit margin increased 17 percentage points in 2011 over 2010 the gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases a decline in sales of low margin sourced products and a lower excess and obsolete inventory requirement 

operating expenses were up 10 for 2011 versus 2010 operating expenses increased driven by volume and growthrelated spending including new sales representatives ecommerce advertising and incremental expenses for the new distribution center in northern california the 2011 year also included costs for the closure of 35 branches in addition 2010 included a 30 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change which reduced the related liability excluding the branch closure costs from 2011 and the 2010 benefit operating expenses increased 7 

for the segment operating earnings of 1066 million for 2011 increased 16 over 920 million in 2010 the improvement in operating earnings for 2011 was due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin partially offset by operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales 

canada 

net sales were 993 million for 2011 an increase of 172 million or 21 when compared with 821 million for 2010 daily sales were up 20 in local currency daily sales increased 15 for 2011 the 20 daily increase for the year consisted of the following contributors 



the increase in net sales was led by growth to heavy manufacturing retail oil and gas and agriculture and mining customers 

the gross profit margin increased 23 percentage points in 2011 over 2010 primarily driven by lower product costs and stronger sales of private label products which carry higher margins 

operating expenses increased 10 in 2011 in local currency operating expenses increased 5 primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs driven by higher bonus expense headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year nonpayroll related expenses also increased driven by volumerelated occupancy and warehouse costs 

operating earnings of 108 million for 2011 were up 61 million or 130 versus 2010 in local currency operating earnings increased 121 due to higher sales an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses which include operations in europe asia latin america and other us operations were up 66 for 2011 the increase in net sales was due primarily to fabory acquired in august of 2011 along with strong growth from all the other international businesses operating earnings for other businesses were 31 million for 2011 compared to 12 million for 2010 the increase was primarily driven by improved performance in japan and mexico 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 1 million of expense in 2011 compared with 7 million of expense in 2010 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 



the reduction in net expense was primarily attributable to a gain of 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the divestiture of graingers 49 ownership in the mro korea co ltd joint venture 

income taxes 

income taxes of 385 million in 2011 increased 13 as compared with 340 million in 2010 graingers effective tax rates were 366 and 398 in 2011 and 2010 respectively the 2011 rate benefited from a tax law change in japan and the settlement of various tax reviews the 2010 effective tax rate included a tax expense related to the us healthcare legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010 excluding these items in both years the effective tax rate for 2011 was 381 compared to 391 in 2010 primarily the result of lower state tax expense and higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in 2011 

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as to pay cash dividends 

cash flow 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

cash from operating activities continues to serve as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2012 were 816 million and increased 70 million from 746 million in 2011 the primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of 32 million as well as an increase of 38 million in net noncash expenses 

net cash used in investing activities of 306 million in 2012 was driven by net cash expended for property buildings equipment and software of 241 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of 65 million additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures  section below net cash used in investing activities was 229 million less than in 2011 due primarily to a decrease in net cash paid for business acquisitions of 294 million versus 2011 

net cash used in financing activities of 394 million in 2012 increased 217 million from 177 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher treasury shares repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2012 versus 2011 cash paid for treasury share purchases was 341 million in 2012 versus 151 million in 2011 an increase of 190 million cash dividends paid were 220 million in 2012 an increase of 39 million versus 2011 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

cash from operating activities served as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2011 were 746 million and increased 150 million from 596 million in 2010 the primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of 153 million higher accounts receivable and inventory balances driven by growth in sales volumes and a new distribution center in northern california partially offset by an increase in accounts payable reduced the operating cash flow from net earnings 

net cash used in investing activities of 535 million in 2011 was driven by net cash expended for property buildings equipment and software of 190 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of 359 million additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures  section below net cash used in investing activities was 366 million more than in 2010 due primarily to an increase in net cash paid for business acquisitions of 297 million versus 2010 

net cash used in financing activities of 177 million in 2011 decreased 401 million from 579 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to lower treasury shares repurchases in 2011 versus 2010 cash paid for treasury share purchases was 151 million in 2011 versus 505 million in 2010 a reduction of 354 million 

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt in addition funds are expended to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

working capital consists of current assets less nonoperating cash and current liabilities less shortterm debt and current maturities of longterm debt working capital was 1604 million  at december 31 2012  compared with 1438 million  at december 31 2011  at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 26  and 24  respectively the 166 million increase in working capital and higher current ratio was primarily related to higher accounts receivable and inventory balances lower accrued compensation and benefits and lower accounts payable 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 



in 2012 significant capital investments were made to build new distribution centers in the united states and for distribution center expansion in canada in addition grainger continued to invest in the improvement of the ecommerce platform new and existing international businesses and for the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

in 2011 significant expenditures were made to build new distribution centers in the united states and for distribution center expansion in canada also a large investment was made to update and improve the ecommerce platform in the united states business finally grainger continued to invest in new and existing international businesses as well as for normal recurring replacement of equipment 

in 2010 significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the us and canada additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment 

in 2013 capital expenditures are expected to range from 280 million to 350 million projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain technology infrastructure and ecommerce grainger expects to fund 2013  capital spending from operating cash 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit refer to note 6  and note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 153  and 159 as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively the reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to increased retained earnings associated with strong earnings in 2012  grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2012  graingers contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 



purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and employee benefits plans as determined by actuarial projections and other employee benefit plans other employmentrelated benefits costs of 45 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

see also note 7  and note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately 43 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2012  this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in graingers results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of graingers financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

note 1  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts    grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable graingers estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for obsolete inventory grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 12 million stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    graingers business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment writedowns that may occur in future periods grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and first performs a qualitative assessment of factors such as a reporting units current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test grainger completed the annual impairment testing using the qualitative approach for all of its reporting units and the twostep quantitative test for two of its reporting units grainger recorded an impairment of 4 million reducing the carrying value of goodwill to 13 million for one of them the estimated fair value of the other reporting unit with the carrying value of goodwill of 125 million exceeded its carrying value and no indication of impairment existed as of the test date 

grainger uses the discounted cash flow method to derive the fair value of a reporting unit the discounted cash flow method requires considerable management judgment assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of its reporting units and general market conditions including terminal growth rate and discount rate assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these unobservable level 3 inputs the results of these tests may differ and impairment charges could occur in future periods while grainger will continue to consider the economic environment and other pertinent factors that may have an adverse effect on its reporting units there can be no assurance that graingers estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows or other inputs used in forecasting the fair value of future cash flows will prove to be accurate projections 

stock incentive plans    grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted used the following assumptions 



the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of graingers stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant because the expense for other stockbased awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements 

postretirement healthcare benefits     postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on graingers postretirement benefit obligation and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year    a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs   as of december 31 2012  grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 45 to 40 to reflect the decrease in market interest rates    grainger estimates that this decrease could reduce 2013 pretax earnings by approximately 5 million    however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poors 500 index and the total international composite index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2012  grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2012  results in thousands of dollars 



during the fourth quarter 2012 grainger implemented an employer group waiver plan egwp and a secondary supplemental wraparound plan for its medicare eligible retiree medical plan participants and the part d retiree drug subsidy rds was eliminated effective january 1 2013 as a result of the implementation of the egwp program the benefit obligation is no longer reduced by part d rds as of december 31 2012 the egwp program does not alter the benefits expected to be provided to the plan participants and is recognized as an actuarial gain for the year ended december 31 2012 as a result of this change graingers postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by 19 million as of december 31 2012 grainger estimates that this change could increase 2013 pretax earnings by approximately 5 million 

during the fourth quarter 2012 grainger also implemented plan design changes effective january 1 2013 employees hired after january 1 2013 will not be eligible for retiree health benefits active participants in the plan as of december 31 2012 will remain eligible for retiree health benefits with the employee contribution structure modified for certain employees based on retirement eligibility as a result of this plan amendment graingers postretirement benefit obligation declined 84 million as of december 31 2012 grainger estimates that this plan amendment could increase 2013 pretax earnings by approximately 20 million 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and therefore may affect graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

insurance reserves  grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels in calculating the liability historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current periods results of operations grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied there were no material adjustments based on graingers historical experience in 2012 2011 and 2010  if actual trends including the nature severity or frequency of claims differ from graingers estimates or if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes    grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

contingent liabilities   at any time grainger may be subject to investigations legal proceedings or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business including claims both by and against grainger such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability contract disputes wage and hour laws employment practices regulatory compliance or other actions brought by employees consumers competitors suppliers or governmental entities grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure as appropriate for claims against grainger when losses become probable and reasonably estimable where grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes graingers best estimate grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against grainger when losses are reasonably possible and material these accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond graingers control 

other      other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws grainger has generally identified such forwardlooking statements by using words such as “anticipate anticipated assumed assumes assumption assumptions believe believes can continue continued continues continues to believe it has complied continuing could estimate estimated estimates expect expectation expected expects forecast forecasts if intend intended intends maintains may might no assurance plans predict predictable presumption project projected projecting projection projections potential potentially reasonably likely scheduled should strategy tend tended timing and outcome are uncertain unanticipated will will be realized and would” or similar expressions 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause graingers results to differ materially from those which are presented 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages litigation involving appropriate payment for wages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 8  and note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on graingers derivative activities 

foreign currency exchange rates 

graingers international subsidiaries generate revenue and expenses in their local currencies grainger  s consolidated earnings are subject to foreign currency translation exposure upon conversion of a foreign entitys statement of earnings from the functional currency to the reporting currency which is the us dollar for 2012 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect graingers international subsidiaries would have resulted in a 7 million decrease in net earnings comparatively in 2011 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect graingers international subsidiaries would have resulted in an 8 million decrease in net earnings a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in an 8 million increase in net earnings for 2012 as compared with an increase in net earnings of 9 million for 2011 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in future potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

interest rates 

grainger is subject to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt portfolio grainger may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage those risks based on graingers variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 2 million for 2012 and 3 million for 2011 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 2 million for 2012 and 3 million for 2011 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in future potential changes in longterm debt levels 

commodity price risk 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to graingers business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

weakness in the economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth economic and industry trends affect graingers business environments economic downturns can cause customers both domestic and international to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase graingers products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the united states canada or any other major world economy could negatively impact graingers sales growth and results of operations 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for graingers products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses competitive pressures could adversely affect graingers sales and profitability 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins  some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market increases in the price of fuel could also drive up transportation costs graingers ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower operating margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations  graingers competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 3500 key suppliers located in various countries around the world no one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however disruptions could occur due to factors beyond graingers control such as economic downturns political unrest trade issues etc any of which could adversely affect a suppliers ability to manufacture or deliver products if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and graingers reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth  grainger is continuing in a multiyear product line expansion program the continued success of this program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2012 and beyond its success will depend on graingers ability to accurately forecast market demand obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain as such there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

disruptions in graingers supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations  a disruption within graingers logistics or supply chain network including damage destruction and other events which would cause one or more of the distribution centers to become nonoperational could adversely affect graingers ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner impair graingers ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to graingers reputation such a disruption could adversely impact the results of operations 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of graingers information systems including its websites is critical to the successful operation of its business grainger continues to invest in software hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems and websites although graingers information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses computer viruses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable among other things graingers ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected any such interruption of graingers information systems could also subject grainger to additional costs 

breaches of information systems security could damage graingers reputation disrupt operations increase costs andor decrease revenues through graingers sales and ecommerce channels grainger collects and stores confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on the website grainger also acquires and retains information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information computer hackers may attempt to penetrate graingers or its vendors information systems and if successful misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information in addition a grainger employee contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information loss of customer supplier employee or other business information could disrupt operations damage graingers reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers suppliers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on grainger its financial condition and results of operations in addition compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations  foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations have an impact on sales costs and cash flows from international operations and could affect reported financial performance 

acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations acquisitions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing the value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies there is a risk of potential losses of key employees of an acquired business and of an inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition additionally problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies graingers operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

graingers continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of graingers reputation  one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years to be successful in the future grainger must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of graingers brand reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities even an isolated incident or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and as a result could tarnish graingers brand and lead to adverse effects on graingers business 

graingers business is subject to various government regulations  graingers business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where it operates and compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business as a government contractor selling to federal state and local government entities grainger is subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements the foreign corrupt practices act tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition regulations and is also subject to audits and inquiries in the ordinary course of business changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation furthermore grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or graingers policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect graingers financial condition or operating results

operating expenses of 21452 million for 2010 increased 110 from 19333 million for 2009 operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions bonuses and profit sharing costs due to improved performance partially offset by a 331 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change which reduced the related liability 

operating earnings of 8605 million for 2010 increased 294 from 6652 million for 2009 the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the strong sales growth and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales 

net earnings attributable to grainger for 2010 increased by 187 to 5109 million from 4305 million in 2009 the increase in net earnings for 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings diluted earnings per share of 693 in 2010 were 233 higher than 562 for 2009 due to increased net earnings and fewer shares outstanding there were two noncash items included in 2010 earnings a 028 per share benefit from a change to a paid time off policy and a 015 per share tax expense related to the tax treatment of retiree healthcare benefits following the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act which when combined resulted in a net benefit of 013 per share results for 2009 included a 037 per share noncash gain from the monotaro transaction in september 2009 excluding these items from both years net earnings increased 294 and earnings per share increased 295 in 2010 versus 2009 

segment analysis 

the following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

united states 

net sales were 60201 million for 2010 an increase of 5747 million or 106 when compared with net sales of 54454 million for 2009 daily sales in the united states were up 110 approximately 9 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume in addition acquisitions and price each added 1 percentage point sales to all customer endmarkets except contractor customers increased for 2010 the overall increase in net sales was led by a mid20 percent increase to reseller customers driven by the sales of products used to assist in the oil spill cleanup a highteen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a low doubledigit increase to light manufacturing customers 

the segment gross profit margin increased 06 percentage point in 2010 over 2009 the gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by an increase in sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins 

operating expenses were up 60 for 2010 versus 2009 operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions bonus expense and profit sharing costs due to improved performance partially offset by a 297 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change which reduced the related liability 

for the segment operating earnings of 9202 million for 2010 increased 251 over 7356 million in 2009 the improvement in operating earnings for 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales 

canada 

net sales were 8209 million for 2010 an increase of 1697 million or 261 when compared with 6512 million for 2009 daily sales were up 266 in local currency daily sales increased 149 for 2010 contributing to the sales growth was 3 percentage points for acquisitions the increase in net sales was led by growth to oil and gas construction and agriculture and mining customers 

the gross profit margin increased 04 percentage point in 2010 over 2009 primarily driven by lower product costs including the positive effect of foreign currency exchange on buying products in us dollars 

  

operating expenses increased 320 in 2010 in local currency operating expenses increased 197 primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs including higher commissions and bonus expense increased volumerelated headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year nonpayroll related expenses also increased driven by higher travel entertainment and advertising due to the sponsorship of the 2010 winter olympic games and increased occupancy and warehouse costs driven in part by the incremental costs for a distribution center opened in the 2010 second quarter 

operating earnings of 468 million for 2010 were up 31 million or 71 versus 2009 due to the foreign exchange rate impact in local currency operating earnings decreased 1 primarily due to increased operating expenses as discussed above 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses which include the following significant operations monotaro mexico china and colombia were up 1361 for 2010 daily sales increased 1370 the increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of results for japan after obtaining controlling interest in september 2009 and colombia acquired in june 2010 along with strong growth from all the other international businesses operating earnings for other businesses were 117 million for 2010 compared to operating losses of 116 million for 2009 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 67 million of expense in 2010 compared with 421 million of income in 2009 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 



the change from net income to net expense was primarily attributable to the noncash gain of 474 million in 2009 from the stepup of the investment in monotaro after grainger became a majority owner 

income taxes 

income taxes of 3402 million in 2010 increased 230 as compared with 2766 million in 2009 graingers effective tax rates were 398 and 391 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in the tax rate in 2010 was primarily driven by a onetime tax expense related to the us healthcare legislation passed in the first quarter of 2010 excluding this tax expense the 2010 effective tax rate was 391 

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as to pay cash dividends 

cash flow 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

cash from operating activities continues to serve as graingers primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations in 2011 were 7461 million and increased 1497 million from 5964 million in 2010 the primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of 1528 million higher accounts receivable and inventory balances driven by growth in sales volumes and a new distribution center in northern california partially offset by an increase in accounts payable reduced the operating cash flow from net earnings 

net cash used in investing activities of 5351 million in 2011 was driven by net cash expended for property buildings equipment and software of 1897 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of 3593 million additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures  section below net cash used in investing activities was 3659 million more than in 2010 due primarily to an increase in net cash paid for business acquisitions of 2972 million versus 2010 

net cash used in financing activities of 1774 million in 2011 decreased 4012 million from 5786 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to lower treasury shares repurchases in 2011 versus 2010 cash paid for treasury share purchases was 1511 million in 2011 versus 5048 million in 2010 a reduction of 3537 million 

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

net cash flows from operations of 5964 million in 2010 decreased 1360 million from 7324 million in 2009 excluding business acquisitions the decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of 1278 million and inventories of 805 million driven by the higher sales volumes the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net earnings 

net cash used in investing activities of 1692 million in 2010 decreased 934 million versus 2626 million in 2009 net cash expended for property buildings equipment and software of 1206 million decreased 201 million from 1407 million in 2009 additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures  section below in addition net cash paid for business acquisitions decreased 610 million versus 2009 

net cash used in financing activities of 5786 million in 2010 increased 1651 million from 4135 million in 2009 grainger repaid 2391 million of longterm debt in 2010 and issued 2000 million of commercial paper resulting in a net use of cash cash paid for treasury share purchases of 5048 million was 1321 million higher than 3727 million in 2009 grainger repurchased 46 million shares in 2010 compared to 45 million shares in 2009 

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt in addition funds are expended on facilities to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was  13070 million  at december 31 2011 compared with  13688 million  at december 31 2010 at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 19  and 26  the 618 million decrease in working capital and lower current ratio was primarily due to an increase in current maturities of longterm debt and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory the changes were primarily driven by higher sales volumes the acquisition of the fabory group and a new distribution center in northern california 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 



in 2011 significant expenditures were made to build new distribution centers in the united states and for distribution center expansion in canada also a large investment was made to update and improve the ecommerce platform in the united states business finally the company continued to invest in new and existing international businesses as well as for normal recurring replacement of equipment 

in 2010 and 2009 significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the us and canada additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment 

capital expenditures are expected to range from 200 million to 225 million in 2012 projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain primarily the new chicago distribution center and distribution centers in canada technology infrastructure and continued investments in ecommerce grainger expects to fund 2012 capital investments from operating cash flows 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit refer to notes 7 and 8 of the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 159  and 178 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to increased retained earnings associated with strong earnings in 2011 grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2011 graingers contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 



purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections and other employee benefit plans other employmentrelated benefits costs of 603 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

see also notes 8 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of 239 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2011 this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in graingers results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of graingers financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts    grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable graingers estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for years 2011 2010 and 2009 actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 

provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as graingers inventory consists of approximately 900000 stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically graingers methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on graingers results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    graingers business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment writedowns that may occur in future periods grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 grainger early adopted the financial accounting standard boards new accounting guidance which allows companies to assess qualitative factors such as a reporting units current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test grainger completed the annual impairment testing using the qualitative approach for all of its reporting units and the twostep quantitative test for one of its reporting units with the carrying value of goodwill of 17 million the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no indication of impairment existed as of the test date grainger uses the discounted cash flow method to derive the fair value of a reporting unit the discounted cash flow method requires considerable management judgment assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of its reporting units and general market conditions including terminal growth rate and discount rate assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these unobservable level 3 inputs the results of these tests may differ and impairment charges could occur in future periods while grainger will continue to consider the economic environment and other pertinent factors that may have an adverse effect on its reporting units there can be no assurance that graingers estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows or other inputs used in forecasting the fair value of future cash flows will prove to be accurate projections 

stock incentive plans    grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted in 2011 2010 and 2009 used the following assumptions 



the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of graingers stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

postretirement healthcare benefits     postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on graingers postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs as of december 31 2011 grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 56 to 45 to reflect the decrease in market interest rates grainger estimates that this decrease could reduce 2012 pretax earnings by approximately 91 million however other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poors 500 index and the total international composite index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2011 grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax at 40 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2011 results in thousands of dollars 



grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and therefore may affect graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

insurance reserves  grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels in calculating the liability historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current periods results of operations grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied there were no material adjustments based on graingers historical experience in 2011 2010 and 2009 if actual trends including the nature severity or frequency of claims differ from our estimates or if business or economic conditions change graingers estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes    grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on managements interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects graingers best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions 

future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

other      other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

some of graingers products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws grainger has generally identified such forwardlooking statements by using words such as “anticipate anticipated assumed assumes assumption assumptions believe believes can continue continued continues continues to believe it has complied continuing could estimate estimated estimates expect expectation expected expects forecast forecasts if intend intended intends may might plans predict predictable presumption project projected projecting projection projections potential potentially reasonably likely scheduled should strategy tended timing and outcome are uncertain unanticipated will will be realized and would” or similar expressions 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause graingers results to differ materially from those which are presented 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages litigation involving appropriate payment for wages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on graingers forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy the derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see notes 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on graingers derivative activities 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as graingers international businesses grow the greater the effect that foreign currency fluctuations have on the companys consolidated earnings for 2011 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect graingers international subsidiaries would have resulted in a 75 million decrease in net earnings comparatively in 2010 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger international subsidiaries would have resulted in a 27 million decrease in net earnings a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 92 million increase in net earnings for 2011 as compared with an increase in net earnings of 33 million for 2010 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

  

interest rates 

grainger is subject to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt portfolio grainger may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage those risks based on the companys variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 30 million for 2011 and 31 million for 2010 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 30 million for 2011 and 31 million for 2010 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in longterm debt levels 

  

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

 

weakness in the economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments economic downturns can cause customers both commercial and government to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase grainger’s products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations 

 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger’s products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger’s sales and profitability 

 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper or oil and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market increases in the price of fuel could also drive up transportation costs grainger’s ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions the inability to pass along costs increases could result in lower operating margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

  

  

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 3000 key suppliers no one of which accounted for more than 5 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however economic downturns can adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

 

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth grainger from time to time expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes in 2006 grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program the continued success of this program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2011 and beyond its success will depend on grainger’s ability to accurately forecast market demand obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain as such there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or breaches of information systems security could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail are breached or are otherwise unavailable grainger’s ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company customer and employee data could be adversely affected 

 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies grainger’s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations have an impact on sales costs and cash flows from international operations and could affect reported financial performance 

 

acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and have an adverse effect on results of operations   acquisitions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing the value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies there is a risk of potential losses of key employees of an acquired business and an ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition additionally problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired 

 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations grainger derives a growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to grainger’s international operations including without limitation import and export requirements the foreign corrupt practices act tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions and such costs may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation furthermore grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or grainger’s policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect grainger’s financial condition or operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

overview 

    general    grainger is a broadline distributor of maintenance repair and operating supplies and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions grainger’s operations are primarily in the united states and canada with an expanding presence in asia and latin america grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives direct marketing materials and catalogs grainger serves approximately 20 million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches distribution centers multiple websites and export services

    business environment    several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape grainger’s business environment the overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting grainger’s growth historically grainger’s sales trends have tended to correlate with industrial production and nonfarm payrolls according to the federal reserve overall industrial production increased 59 from december 2009 to december 2010 both the united states’ and canada’s gdp grew an estimated 29 in 2010 the improvement in the economy has positively affected grainger’s sales growth for the twelve months of 2010 

 

in february 2011 consensus forecastsusa projected 2011 industrial production and gdp growth for the united states of 46 and 32 respectively and gdp growth of 26 for canada 

 

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised approximately 25 of grainger’s total 2010 sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels in the united states increased approximately 12 from december 2009 to december 2010 while manufacturing output increased 09 from december 2009 to december 2010 this increase in manufacturing employment and output contributed to an upper teen percent increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a low doubledigit percent increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for grainger in 2010 

 

    outlook    grainger intends to take advantage of its strong financial position by continuing to make investments in growth such as hiring additional sales representatives and onsite inventory services managers and expanding product breadth and availability and ecommerce capabilities as well as the company’s global presence these investments should contribute to continued market share growth by helping businesses and institutions streamline their purchasing processes and reduce costs as of january 25 2011 grainger forecasts 5 to 9 percent in sales growth and 715 to 790 of earnings per share for the full year of 2011 

 

the sales growth for 2011 while still strong is expected to be at a lower rate than 2010 primarily due to more difficult comparisons the 2010 results reflect the effect of economic recovery as well as a one percentage point contribution from sales of products used to assist in the oil spill cleanup that will not repeat in 2011 

 

matters affecting comparability  there were 254 sales days in 2010 255 in 2009 and 256 in 2008

gross profit of 30057 million for 2010 increased 157 the gross profit margin for 2010 was 418 flat versus 2009 the gross profit margin was favorably affected by flat prices while product costs decreased offset by faster sales growth from the lower margin international businesses and by an increase in sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins 

 

operating expenses of 21452 million for 2010 increased 110 from 19333 million for 2009 operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions bonuses and profit sharing costs due to improved performance partially offset by a 331 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change which reduced the related liability 

 

operating earnings of 8605 million for 2010 increased 294 from 6652 million for 2009 the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the strong sales growth and operating expenses which increased at a slower rate than sales 

 

net earnings attributable to grainger for 2010 increased by 187 to 5109 million from 4305 million in 2009 the increase in net earnings for 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings diluted earnings per share of 693 in 2010 were 233 higher than 562 for 2009 due to increased net earnings and fewer shares outstanding there were two unusual noncash items included in 2010 earnings a 028 per share benefit from a change to a paid time off policy and a 015 per share tax expense related to the tax treatment of retiree healthcare benefits following the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act which resulted in a net benefit of 013 per share results for 2009 included a 037 per share noncash gain from the monotaro transaction in september 2009 excluding these unusual items from both years net earnings increased 294 and earnings per share increased 295 in 2010 versus 2009 

 

segment analysis 

the following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

united states 

net sales were 60201 million for 2010 an increase of 5747 million or 106 when compared with net sales of 54454 million for 2009 daily sales in the united states were up 110 approximately 9 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume in addition acquisitions and price each added 1 percentage point sales to all customer endmarkets except contractor customers increased for 2010 the overall increase in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent increase to reseller customers driven by the sales of products used to assist in the oil spill cleanup a high teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a low doubledigit increase to light manufacturing customers 

 

  

  

the segment gross profit margin increased 06 percentage point in 2010 over 2009 the gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by an increase in sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins 

 

operating expenses were up 60 for 2010 versus 2009 operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions bonus expense and profit sharing costs due to improved performance partially offset by a 297 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change which reduced the related liability 

 

for the segment operating earnings of 9202 million for 2010 increased 251 over 7356 million in 2009 the improvement in operating earnings for 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales 

canada 

net sales were 8209 million for 2010 an increase of 1697 million or 261 when compared with 6512 million for 2009 daily sales were up 266 and in local currency daily sales increased 149 for 2010 contributing to the sales growth was 3 percentage points for acquisitions the increase in net sales was led by growth to oil and gas construction and agriculture and mining customers 

 

the gross profit margin increased 04 percentage point in 2010 over 2009 primarily driven by lower product costs including the positive effect of foreign currency exchange on buying products in us dollars 

  

operating expenses increased 320 in 2010 in local currency operating expenses increased 197 primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs including higher commissions and bonus expense increased volumerelated headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year nonpayroll related expenses also increased driven by higher travel entertainment and advertising due to the sponsorship of the 2010 winter olympic games and increased occupancy and warehouse costs driven in part by the incremental costs for a distribution center opened in the 2010 second quarter 

 

operating earnings of 468 million for 2010 were up 31 million or 71 versus 2009 due to the foreign exchange rate impact in local currency operating earnings decreased 1 primarily due to increased operating expenses as discussed above 

 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses which include japan mexico india puerto rico china colombia and panama were up 1361 for 2010 daily sales increased 1370 the increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of results for japan after obtaining controlling interest in september 2009 and colombia acquired in june 2010 along with strong growth from all the other international businesses operating earnings for other businesses were 117 million for 2010 compared to operating losses of 116 million for 2009 

 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 67 million of expense in 2010 compared with 421 million of income in 2009 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 

 

 

 

 

the change from net income to net expense was primarily attributable to the onetime noncash gain of 474 million in 2009 from the stepup of the investment in monotaro after grainger became a majority owner 

 

income taxes 

income taxes of 3402 million in 2010 increased 230 as compared with 2766 million in 2009 grainger’s effective tax rates were 398 and 391 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in the tax rate in 2010 was primarily driven by a onetime tax expense related to the us healthcare legislation passed in the first quarter of 2010 excluding this onetime tax expense the 2010 effective tax rate was 391 

 

for 2011 grainger is estimating its effective tax rate to be approximately 392 the increase is primarily due to a higher income tax rate adopted in the state of illinois in the first quarter of 2011 

 

  

  

2009 compared to 2008 

grainger’s net sales of 62220 million for 2009 decreased 92 when compared with net sales of 68500 million for 2008 there was one less selling day in 2009 versus 2008 daily sales were down 88 sales were negatively affected by a decline in volume of approximately 14 percentage points partially offset by price increases of approximately 5 percentage points in addition sales were negatively affected by 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange while sales from acquisitions contributed approximately 1 percentage point the overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector followed by a low 20 percent decline in the reseller customer sector and a mid teen percent decline in the contractor customer sector the government customer sector performed the strongest as sales were flat for 2009 followed by a mid singledigit decline in the commercial customer sector refer to the segment analysis below for further details 

 

gross profit of 25985 million for 2009 decreased 75 the gross profit margin for 2009 increased 08 percentage point to 418 from 410 in 2008 the improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by an increase in the mix of sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins 

 

operating expenses of 19333 million for 2009 decreased 46 from 20256 million for 2008 operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of lower headcount profit sharing and incentive compensation nonpayroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts 

 

operating earnings of 6652 million for 2009 decreased 150 from 7827 million for 2008 the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to the decline in sales combined with operating expenses which declined at a lower rate than sales these declines were partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin 

 

net earnings for 2009 decreased by 94 to 4305 million from 4754 million in 2008 the decline in net earnings for 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in operating earnings partially offset by the onetime noncash pretax gain of 474 million 28 million after tax from the stepup of the investment in monotaro after grainger became a majority owner in september 2009 diluted earnings per share of 562 in 2009 were 59 lower than 597 for 2008 primarily due to the decline in net earnings partially offset by lower shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2009 grainger adopted authoritative guidance regarding “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” resulting in a seven cent reduction to the previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share 

 

segment analysis 

the following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

united states 

net sales were 54454 million for 2009 a decrease of 6124 million or 101 when compared with net sales of 60578 million for 2008 daily sales in the united states were down 98 all customer sectors were negatively impacted by economic conditions the overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and in the reseller customer sector the contractor and light manufacturing customer sectors declined in the mid teens and high single digits respectively while the government customer sector performed the strongest with flat sales for 2009 

 

beginning in 2006 grainger has added approximately 234000 new products to supplement the plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines as part of the business’ ongoing product line expansion initiative the catalog issued in february 2010 offered a total of 307000 products an increase of 70000 products over the 2009 catalog 

 

the segment gross profit margin increased 13 percentage points in 2009 over 2008 the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers 

 

operating expenses in this segment were down 46 for 2009 operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of reduced headcount lower profit sharing and no incentive compensation partially offset by an increase in severance costs nonpayroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts 

 

for the segment operating earnings of 7356 million for 2009 decreased 125 over 8404 million for 2008 this decrease in operating earnings for 2009 was primarily due to the decline in net sales and operating expenses which declined at a lower rate than sales partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin 

 

canada 

net sales were 6512 million for 2009 a decrease of 768 million or 106 when compared with 7280 million for 2008 daily sales were down 102 and in local currency daily sales decreased 39 for 2009 the decrease in net sales was led by declines in the heavy manufacturing and contractor customer sectors driven by economic conditions partially offsetting these declines were strong sales to the utilities customer sector driven by special projects and to higher sales to the government 

 

  

  

the gross profit margin decreased 11 percentage points in 2009 over 2008 the decline in the gross profit margin was primarily due to cost increases exceeding price increases and an increase in the mix of lower margin sales particularly to large customers 

 

operating expenses decreased 115 in 2009 in local currency operating expenses decreased 56 primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation accruals and nonpayroll related expenses including lower travel and advertising costs in addition 2008 included expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services 

 

operating earnings of 437 million for 2009 were down 105 million or 194 versus 2008 in local currency operating earnings decreased 156 primarily due to the decline in net sales and gross profit margin 

 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses which include japan mexico india puerto rico china and panama were up 477 for 2009 daily sales increased 483 the increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of results from the acquisitions of the businesses in india and japan along with a positive contribution from china operating losses for other businesses were 116 million for 2009 a 16 improvement compared to operating losses of 118 million for 2008 

 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 421 million of income in 2009 an increase of 516 million as compared with 95 million of expense in 2008 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 

 

 

 

 

 

the change from net expense to net income was primarily attributable to the onetime noncash gain of 474 million from the stepup of the investment in monotaro after grainger became a majority owner in september 2009 in addition 2008 included the writeoff of a joint venture investment in india as described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements other operating income is lower primarily due to lower foreign currency transactions gains versus 2008 

 

income taxes 

income taxes of 2766 million in 2009 decreased 72 as compared with 2979 million in 2008 grainger’s effective tax rates were 391 and 385 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in the tax rate in 2009 was primarily driven by increased us state tax rates 

 

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as to pay cash dividends 

 

cash flow 

 

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

cash from operating activities continues to serve as grainger’s primary source of liquidity net cash flows from operations of 5964 million in 2010 decreased 1360 million from 7324 million in 2009 excluding business acquisitions the decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of 1278 million and inventories of 805 million driven by the higher sales volumes the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net earnings 

 

net cash used in investing activities of 1692 million in 2010 decreased 934 million versus 2626 million in 2009 net cash expended for property buildings equipment and software of 1206 million decreased 201 million from 1407 million in 2009 additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below in addition net cash paid for business acquisitions decreased 610 million versus 2009 

 

  

  

net cash used in financing activities of 5786 million in 2010 increased 1651 million from 4135 million in 2009 grainger repaid 2391 million of longterm debt in 2010 and issued 2000 million of commercial paper resulting in a net use of cash cash paid for treasury share purchases of 5048 million was 1321 million higher than 3727 million in 2009 grainger repurchased 46 million shares in 2010 compared to 45 million shares in 2009 in 2011 treasury share repurchases are expected to be 210 million to 265 million 

 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

net cash provided by operations of 7324 million increased 2023 million in 2009 versus 5301 million in 2008 the increase was primarily driven by a decrease in inventories due to lower purchases in response to the slowdown in the economy and lower sales volumes partially offsetting the increase were lower net earnings of 446 million in 2009 versus 2008 

 

net cash used in investing activities of 2626 million in 2009 increased 599 million versus 2008 the increase was primarily due to 1231 million paid for business acquisitions net of cash acquired 888 million higher than in 2008 net cash expended for property buildings equipment and capitalized software was 1407 million 407 million lower than 1814 million in 2008 

 

net cash used in financing activities of 4135 million in 2009 was 3767 million higher than 368 million in 2008 proceeds from a fouryear bank term loan of 5000 million were included in 2008 and used to pay off 959 million in commercial paper cash paid for treasury stock purchases of 3727 million was 215 million lower than 3942 million in 2008 grainger repurchased 45 million shares in 2009 compared to 55 million shares in 2008 

  

working capital 

internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt in addition funds are expended on facilities to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

 

working capital was 13688 million at december 31 2010 compared with 13547 million at december 31 2009 and 13824 million at december 31 2008 at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 26 27 and 28 working capital and the current ratio were essentially flat over this threeyear period 

 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 

 

 

 

in 2010 and 2009 significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the us and canada additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment 

 

in 2008 grainger substantially completed its investments in the market expansion program in the united states that realigned branches in the top 25 major metropolitan areas in addition there was continued international investment including branch expansion in mexico as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

 

capital expenditures are expected to range from 175 million to 200 million in 2011 projected investments include continued investments in distribution centers information technology and the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2011 capital investments from operating cash flows 

 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit a fouryear bank term loan of 5000 million obtained in may 2008 was partially prepaid by proceeds from 2000 million of commercial paper issued in 2010 grainger’s available lines of credit were 4000 million at december 31 2010 and 2500 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 178 191 and 207 as of the same dates the reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily the result of the reduction in longterm debt grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 

 

  

  

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2010 grainger’s contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 

 

 

 

purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

 

other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections and other employee benefit plans other employmentrelated benefits costs of 488 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

see also notes 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of 360 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2010 this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in grainger’s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of grainger’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

 

note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

  

  

allowance for doubtful accounts  grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer based on analysis of actual historical writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable grainger’s estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts however writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends and grainger’s estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes for years 2010 2009 and 2008 actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 

 

provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

 

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values as grainger’s inventory consists of approximately 800000 stocked products it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a sku level and no individual sku is material there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of writeoffs historically grainger’s methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on grainger’s results of operations based on significant changes in product demand market conditions or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change grainger’s estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 

 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    grainger’s business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment writedowns that grainger may incur in future periods grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level grainger’s tests indicated that the fair values were substantially in excess of carrying values and thus did not fail step one of the goodwill impairment test grainger’s determination of fair value requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of acquired businesses and market conditions however due to the inherent uncertainties associated with using these assumptions impairment charges could occur in future periods 

 

stock incentive plans  grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted in 2010 2009 and 2008 used the following assumptions 

 

 

 

the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders’ exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of grainger’s stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

 

the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

 

  

  

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 

 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

postretirement healthcare benefits    postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs as of december 31 2010 grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of   its postretirement plan obligation from 60 to 56 to reflect the decrease in market interest rates grainger estimates that this decrease in the discount rate will decrease 2011 pretax earnings by approximately 27 million although other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poor’s 500 index and beginning in 2010 the total international composite index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2010 grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax at 40 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2010 results in thousands of dollars 

 

 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and therefore may affect grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future expense 

 

for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

insurance reserves  grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels in calculating the liability historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made 

 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied there were no material adjustments based on grainger’s historical experience in 2010 2009 and 2008 if actual trends including the nature severity or frequency of claims differ from our estimates or if business or economic conditions change grainger’s estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

  

  

income taxes  grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management’s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects grainger’s best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

 

other    other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets fair value measurements and valuations and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

inflation 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

 

some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper or oil and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations 

 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws grainger has generally identified such forwardlooking statements by using words such as “anticipate anticipated assumed assumes assumption assumptions believe believes continue continued continues to believe it has complied continuing could estimate estimated estimates expectation expected expects forecast forecasts intended intends may might plans predict predictable presumption project projected projecting projection projections potential potentially reasonably likely scheduled should tended timing and outcome are uncertain unanticipated will will be realized and would” or similar expressions 

 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause grainger’s results to differ materially from those which are presented 

 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages litigation involving appropriate payment for wages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger’s forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies grainger may use financial instruments to hedge certain exposures as part of its overall risk management strategy in 2010 grainger entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the foreign exchange rate effect on its net investment in its canadian subsidiary these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and therefore the effective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

 

the net losses on grainger’s net investment hedges reported in other comprehensive income were 36 million net of tax effects in 2010 see notes 10 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on grainger’s derivative activities 

 

for 2010 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 27 million decrease in net earnings comparatively in 2009 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 09 million decrease in net earnings a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 33 million increase in net earnings for 2010 as compared with an increase in net earnings of 11 million for 2009 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 

 

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio during 2010 and 2009 all of its longterm debt was variable rate debt a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 31 million for 2010 and 33 million for 2009 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 31 million for 2010 and 33 million for 2009 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in longterm debt levels 

 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

 

weakness in the economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments economic downturns can cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase grainger’s products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations the recent global economic crisis has had a negative effect on grainger’s sales 

 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger’s products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses retail enterprises and internetbased businesses competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger’s sales and profitability 

 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper or oil and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger’s ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions the inability to pass along costs increases could result in lower operating margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 3400 key suppliers no one of which accounted for more than 2 of total purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however economic   

  

downturns can adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

 

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth grainger from time to time expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes in 2006 grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program the continued success of this program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2010 and beyond its success will depend on grainger’s ability to accurately forecast market demand obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain as such there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable grainger’s ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected 

 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies grainger’s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations have an impact on sales costs and cash flows from international operations and could affect reported financial performance 

 

acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and have an adverse effect on results of operations   acquisitions both foreign and domestic involve various inherent risks such as uncertainties in assessing the value strengths weaknesses liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies there is a risk of potential losses of key employees of an acquired business and an ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition additionally problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause grainger not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units accordingly goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

overview 

general    grainger distributes facilities maintenance products and provides related services and information used by businesses and institutions primarily in the united states canada japan and mexico to keep their facilities and equipment running grainger has two reportable segments the united states and canada grainger integrated the lab safety supply business into the grainger industrial supply business in 2009 and results are now reported under the united states segment the canada segment reflects the results for acklands – grainger inc other businesses include the following monotaro co ltd japan grainger sa de cv mexico grainger industrial supply india private limited india grainger caribe inc puerto rico grainger china llc china and grainger panama sa panama   grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives direct marketing materials and catalogs grainger serves approximately 20 million customers through a network of highly integrated branches distribution centers and multiple web sites 

 

business environment    several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger’s business environment and projections for the coming year historically grainger’s sales trends have tended to correlate positively with industrial production and nonfarm payrolls in february 2010 consensus forecastusa reported a 2009 decline of 97 and 24 for industrial production and gdp respectively according to the federal reserve nonfarm payrolls decreased 31 from december 2008 to december 2009 the continued decline in the economy affected grainger’s sales growth for 2009 which declined 9 percent 

 

in february 2010 consensus forecastusa projected 2010 gdp growth of 31 and industrial production growth of 49 for the united states in february 2010 consensus forecastusa projected gdp growth of 27 for canada as compared with a 25 estimated decline in 2009 

 

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised approximately 24 of grainger’s total 2009 sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels in the united states declined approximately 99 from december 2008 to december 2009 while manufacturing output decreased 13 from december 2008 to december 2009 this decline in manufacturing employment and output contributed to a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a high singledigit decline in the light manufacturing customer sector for grainger in 2009 

 

outlook    while in early 2010 there are some initial signs of improvement in the overall economy job growth is expected to lag the economic recovery grainger expects positive sales growth in 2010 of 6 to 10 percent which will be realized through the impact of acquisitions made in 2009 favorable foreign exchange rates and organic growth beginning in 2006 grainger has added approximately 234000 new products as part of its multiyear product line expansion program in the united states of which 70000 were added to the 2010 catalog issued in february products were added to supplement the plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines the product line expansion program has been a positive contributor to sales since being launched and is expected to continue to be a driver of growth in 2010 and beyond grainger plans to continue to invest in the business and may choose to fund some additional sales and marketing programs to increase market share if sales trends accelerate in 2010 

 

operating expenses are expected to increase in 2010 compared to 2009 due in part to incremental expenses from the businesses acquired in 2009 in addition part of the expenses eliminated in 2009 as a result of lowering the cost structure will return such as merit increases and incentive compensation grainger expects some reduction in operating expenses in 2010 from changes in its paid time off program partially offsetting these increases 

 

capital expenditures are expected to range from 150 million to 175 million in 2010 projected investments include continued investments in distribution centers information technology and the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2010 capital investments from operating cash flows 

 

matters affecting comparability  there were 255 sales days in 2009 and 2007 compared to 256 sales days in 2008 

 

grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2008 and 2009 all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate grainger’s operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition date

results of operations 

the following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in grainger’s consolidated statements of earnings 

 

 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

grainger’s net sales of 62220 million for 2009 decreased 92 when compared with net sales of 68500 million for 2008 there was one less selling day in 2009 versus 2008 daily sales were down 88 sales were negatively affected by a decline in volume of approximately 14 percentage points partially offset by price increases of approximately 5 percentage points in addition sales were negatively affected by 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange while sales from acquisitions contributed approximately 1 percentage point the overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector followed by a low 20 percent decline in the reseller customer sector and a midteen percent decline in the contractor customer sector the government customer sector performed the strongest as sales were flat for 2009 followed by a mid singledigit decline in the commercial customer sector refer to the segment analysis below for further details 

 

gross profit of 25985 million for 2009 decreased 75 the gross profit margin for 2009 increased 08 percentage point to 418 from 410 in 2008 the improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by an increase in the mix of sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins 

 

operating expenses of 19333 million for 2009 decreased 46 from 20256 million for 2008 operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of lower headcount profit sharing and incentive compensation nonpayroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts 

 

operating earnings of 6652 million for 2009 decreased 150 from 7827 million for 2008 the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to the decline in sales combined with operating expenses which declined at a lower rate than sales these declines were partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin 

 

net earnings for 2009 decreased by 94 to 4305 million from 4754 million in 2008 the decline in net earnings for 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in operating earnings partially offset by the onetime noncash pretax gain of 474 million 28 million after tax from the stepup of the investment in monotaro after grainger became a majority owner in september 2009 diluted earnings per share of 562 in 2009 were 59 lower than 597 for 2008 primarily due to the decline in net earnings partially offset by lower shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2009 grainger adopted authoritative guidance regarding “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” resulting in a seven cent reduction to the previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share 

 

segment analysis 

the following comments at the segment and business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

united states 

net sales were 54454 million for 2009 a decrease of 6124 million or 101 when compared with net sales of 60578 million for 2008 daily sales in the united states were down 98 all customer sectors were negatively impacted by economic conditions the overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and in the reseller customer sector the contractor and light manufacturing customer sectors declined in the midteens and high single digits respectively while the government customer sector 

  

  

performed the strongest with flat sales for 2009 due to the impact of acquisitions made in 2009 favorable foreign exchange rates and organic growth sales are expected to improve in 2010 

 

beginning in 2006 grainger has added approximately 234000 new products to supplement the plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines as part of the business’ ongoing product line expansion initiative the most recent catalog issued in february 2010 offers a total of 307000 products an increase of 70000 products over the 2009 catalog 

 

the segment gross profit margin increased 13 percentage points in 2009 over 2008 the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases partially offset by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers 

 

operating expenses in this segment were down 46 for 2009 operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of reduced headcount lower profit sharing and no incentive compensation partially offset by an increase in severance costs nonpayroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts 

 

for the segment operating earnings of 7356 million for 2009 decreased 125 over 8404 million for 2008 this decrease in operating earnings for 2009 was primarily due to the decline in net sales and operating expenses which declined at a lower rate than sales partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin 

 

canada 

net sales were 6512 million for 2009 a decrease of 768 million or 106 when compared with 7280 million for 2008 daily sales were down 102 and in local currency daily sales decreased 39 for 2009 the decrease in net sales was led by declines in the heavy manufacturing and contractor customer sectors driven by economic conditions partially offsetting these declines were strong sales to the utilities customer sector driven by special projects and to higher sales to the government 

 

the gross profit margin decreased 11 percentage points in 2009 over 2008 the decline in the gross profit margin was primarily due to cost increases exceeding price increases and an increase in the mix of lower margin sales particularly to large customers 

 

operating expenses decreased 115 in 2009 in local currency operating expenses decreased 56 primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation accruals and nonpayroll related expenses including lower travel and advertising costs in addition 2008 included expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services 

 

operating earnings of 437 million for 2009 were down 105 million or 194 for 2009 in local currency operating earnings decreased 156 primarily due to the decline in net sales and gross profit margin 

 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses which include japan mexico india puerto rico china and panama were up 477 for 2009 daily sales increased 483 the increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of results from the acquisitions of the businesses in india and japan along with a positive contribution from china operating losses for other businesses were 116 million for 2009 a 16 improvement compared to operating losses of 118 million for 2008 

 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 421 million of income in 2009 an increase of 516 million as compared with 95 million of expense in 2008 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 

  

 

 

the change from net expense to net income was primarily attributable to the onetime noncash gain of 474 million from the stepup of the investment in monotaro after grainger became a majority owner in september 2009 in addition 2008 included the writeoff of a joint venture investment in india as described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements other operating income is lower primarily due to lower foreign currency transactions gains versus 2008 

  

  

income taxes 

income taxes of 2766 million in 2009 decreased 72 as compared with 2979 million in 2008 grainger’s effective tax rates were 391 and 385 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in the tax rate in 2009 was primarily driven by increased us state tax rates 

 

for 2010 grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 393 the increase is primarily due to current estimates of the us state tax rates and unfavorable impacts of nonus tax jurisdictions 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

grainger’s net sales of 68500 million for 2008 increased 67 when compared with net sales of 64180 million for 2007 there was one more selling day in 2008 versus 2007 daily sales were up 63 the increase in net sales was led by high singledigit sales growth in the government sector and mid singledigit sales growth in the commercial and reseller sectors approximately 1 percentage point of the sales growth came from grainger’s product line expansion initiative and approximately 5 percentage points came from price and volume refer to the segment analysis below for further detail of grainger’s ongoing strategic initiatives 

 

the gross profit margin for 2008 improved 04 percentage point to 410 from 406 in 2007 the improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding cost increases partially offset by an increase in the mix of sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins 

 

operating earnings of 7827 million for 2008 increased 167 over the 6707 million for 2007 this earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and positive operating expense leverage 

 

net earnings for 2008 increased by 131 to 4754 million from 4201 million in 2007 the growth in net earnings for 2008 primarily resulted from the improvement in operating earnings partially offset by lower interest income higher interest expense and the writeoff of grainger’s 60 million investment in grainger industrial supply india private limited formerly known as asia pacific brands india private limited diluted earnings per share of 597 in 2008 were 216 higher than the 491 for 2007 this improvement was higher than the percentage increase for net earnings due to the effect of grainger’s share repurchase program 

 

segment analysis 

the following comments at the segment and business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

united states 

net sales were 60578 million for 2008 an increase of 3285 million or 57 when compared with net sales of 57293 million for 2007 daily sales were up 53 sales were led by high singledigit sales growth in the government sector and mid singledigit sales growth in the commercial and reseller sectors approximately 2 percentage points of the sales growth came from the product line expansion initiative and approximately 4 percentage points came from price and volume sales volume was negatively affected by approximately 1 percentage point due to a decline in sales of seasonal products 

 

in 2004 a multiyear market expansion program was launched to strengthen grainger’s presence in top metropolitan markets and better position it to serve local customers the market expansion program was completed in 2008 however the benefits realized from this initiative are expected to continue 

 

consistent with the overall downturn in the economy beginning in october most of these markets saw negative sales growth which significantly affected sales growth for 2008 results for the market expansion program were as follows 

 

 

over the past three years over 150000 new products have been added to supplement the plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines as part of the business’ ongoing product line expansion initiative the catalog issued in 2009 offered a total of 237000 products an increase of 50000 products over the 2008 catalog 

 

the segment gross profit margin increased 04 percentage point in 2008 over 2007 driven primarily by price increases exceeding cost increases partially offset by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers 

  

  

operating expenses in this segment were up 33 in 2008 expenses grew at a slower rate than sales primarily due to lower advertising expenses incentive compensation severance and lower bad debt expense the result of improved collection efficiency 

 

for the segment operating earnings of 8404 million for 2008 increased 149 over the 7316 million for 2007 this earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and positive operating expense leverage 

 

canada 

net sales were 7280 million for 2008 an increase of 915 million or 144 when compared with 6365 million for 2007 daily sales were up 139 in local currency daily sales increased 131 the increase was led by sales growth in the contractor agriculture and mining and government sectors macro economic factors such as higher commodity prices for oil gas and mineral products drove a significant portion of this growth due to an increase in customer demand in these sectors sales to new customers and increased sales penetration to existing customers was also a contributing factor to these increases 

 

the gross profit margin increased 03 percentage points in 2008 over 2007 the improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to price increases exceeding cost increases 

 

operating expenses were up 137 in 2008 the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to payroll and benefits as a result of increased headcount merit increases and commissions and higher advertising and occupancy expenses and expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services 

 

operating earnings of 543 million for 2008 were up 100 million or 227 this earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than sales 

 

other businesses 

net sales for other businesses which include mexico puerto rico china and panama were up 195 for 2008 daily sales increased 190 the increase in net sales was due primarily to mexico as sales increased 119 in 2008 versus 2007 daily sales were up 115 in local currency daily sales were up 127 driven primarily by increased market share coming from the ongoing branch expansion program operating losses for other businesses were 118 million for 2008 a 578 increase over operating losses of 75 million for 2007 

 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 95 million of expense in 2008 compared with 112 million of income in 2007 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 

 

 

the change from net interest income to net interest expense was primarily attributable to the fouryear bank term loan obtained in may 2008 the writeoff of the investment relates to grainger industrial supply india private limited formerly known as asia pacific brands india private limited as described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements other nonoperating income increased primarily due to higher foreign exchange transaction gains 

 

income taxes 

income taxes of 2979 million in 2008 increased 138 as compared with 2617 million in 2007 grainger’s effective tax rates were 385 and 384 in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

  

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as pay cash dividends 

 

cash flow 

net cash flows from operations of 7324 million in 2009 5301 million in 2008 and 4689 million in 2007 continued to improve grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding contributing to cash flows from operations were net earnings for 2009 of 4308 million and the effect of noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization partially offset by the noncash pretax gain of 473 million from unconsolidated entities after grainger became a majority owner also contributing to net cash provided by operating activities were changes in operating assets and liabilities which resulted in a net source of cash of 1218 million for 2009 the principal operating source of cash was a decrease in inventory due to lower purchases   other current liabilities declined primarily due to reduced profit sharing and incentive compensation accruals 

 

net cash provided by operations increased 612 million in 2008 over 2007 driven primarily by increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisitions reduced cash by 1431 million in 2008 this use of cash was driven primarily by an increase in inventory due to the product line expansion initiative 

 

net cash flows used in investing activities were 2626 million 2026 million and 1970 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively cash expended for property buildings equipment and capitalized software was 1424 million 1950 million and 1974 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below in 2009 grainger funded infrastructure improvement projects in the distribution centers in the united states canada and mexico and paid 1218 million for business acquisitions and other investments net of cash received in 2008 grainger continued to fund the company’s market expansion initiative 

 

net cash flows used in financing activities for 2009 2008 and 2007 were 4135 million 368 million and 5139 million respectively proceeds from the fouryear bank term loan of 500 million were included in 2008 treasury stock purchases were 3727 million in 2009 as grainger repurchased 45 million shares compared to purchases of 3942 million in 2008 to repurchase 55 million shares as of december 31 2009 approximately 31 million shares of common stock remained available under grainger’s repurchase authorization dividends paid to shareholders were 1347 million in 2009 versus 1215 million in 2008 grainger also used cash in financing activities to repay 189 million of longterm debt borrowings in 2009 and 814 million to repay shortterm borrowings in 2008 in 2007 treasury stock purchases were 6473 million for 72 million shares and dividends paid to shareholders were 1131 million 

  

working capital 

internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and of funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated in addition funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

 

working capital was 13547 million at december 31 2009 compared with 13824 million at december 31 2008 and 9744 million at december 31 2007 at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 27 28 and 22 working capital and the current ratio were essentially flat in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in the current ratio and working capital from 2007 to 2008 primarily related to increases in cash and inventories and the replacement of shortterm borrowings with longterm borrowings 

 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 

 

 

in 2009 significant capital expenditures included investments in the united states distribution center network in addition there was continued investment in canada and other international branches and distribution centers as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

  

  

in 2008 grainger substantially completed its investments in the market expansion program in the united states which realigned branches in the top 25 major metropolitan areas in addition there was continued international investment including branch expansion in mexico as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

 

in 2007 grainger’s investments included the market expansion program mexico and china expansion and the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

 

capital expenditures are expected to range from 150 million to 175 million in 2010 projected investments include continued investments in distribution centers information technology and the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2010 capital investments from operating cash flows 

 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit a fouryear bank term loan of 500 million was obtained in may 2008 proceeds were used to pay down shortterm debt and for general corporate purposes at december 31 2009 grainger’s longterm debt rating by standard  poor’s was aa grainger’s available lines of credit as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements were 2500 million at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 191 207 and 50 as of the same dates the increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization in 2008 was primarily the result of the 500 million bank term loan grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 

 

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2009 grainger’s contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars 

 

 

 

purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

 

other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections other employmentrelated benefits costs of 391 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

see also notes 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of 279 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2009 this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in grainger’s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of grainger’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

 

note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts  grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 

 

inventory reserves  grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger’s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 

 

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger’s results of operations 

 

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets    grainger’s business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment writedowns that grainger may incur in future periods grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values grainger determines fair value using an income approach in conjunction with relevant market information which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability of acquired businesses grainger believes that it does not have a material amount of goodwill at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test however due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and market conditions impairment charges could occur in future periods 

 

stock incentive plans  grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted in 2009 2008 and 2007 used the following assumptions 

 

 

  

  

the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders’ exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of grainger’s stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant the dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

 

the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 

 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

postretirement healthcare benefits      postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employee related factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality rates changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs as of december 31 2009 grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of   its postretirement plan obligation from 59 to 60 to reflect the increase in market interest rates grainger estimates that this increase in the discount rate will increase 2010 pretax earnings by approximately 06 million although other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poor’s 500 index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2009 grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax at 40 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2009 results in thousands of dollars 

 

 

in 2009 grainger changed the mortality table used in the postretirement valuation from rp2000 to the irs 2008 fully generational mortality table which builds in future increases in healthcare rates and expenses due to improved mortality rates this change resulted in a 139 million increase of the postretirement healthcare obligation as of december 31 2009 and is estimated to decrease 2010 pretax earnings by approximately 25 million other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

  

  

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and therefore may affect grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future expense 

 

for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

insurance reserves  grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 

 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations 

 

income taxes  grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management’s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects grainger’s best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

 

other   other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

new accounting standards 

the following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on grainger upon adoption 

 

in december 2008 the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding employer’s disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets codified primarily in asc 715 asc 715 requires expanded disclosures about investment policies and strategies for the plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan including information regarding major categories of assets input and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within the plans the company has applied the provision of asc 715 and the adoption did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

 

in june 2009 the fasb issued “the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” codified in asc 105 which established the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities the accounting standards codification superseded all existing nonsec accounting and reporting standards asc 105 was effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after september 15 2009 the company has applied this statement and the adoption did not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 

 

inflation 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

 

some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper or oil and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations 

 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws grainger has generally identified such forwardlooking statements by using words such as “anticipate anticipated assumed assumes assumption assumptions believe believes continue continued continues continues to believe it complies could estimate estimated estimates expectation expected expects forecast forecasts had potentially intended intends likely may might plans predict predictable presumption project projected projecting projection projections potential reasonably likely scheduled should tended timing and outcome are uncertain unanticipated unlikely will will be realized and would” or similar expressions 

 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause grainger’s results to differ materially from those which are presented 

 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

 

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger’s forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies for 2009 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 09 million decrease in net earnings comparatively in 2008 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 26 million decrease in net earnings a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 11 million increase in net earnings for 2009 as compared with an increase in net earnings of 31 million for 2008 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

 

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio during 2009 and 2008 all of its longterm debt was variable rate debt a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 33 million for 2009 and 25 million for 2008 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 33 million for 2009 and 25 million for 2008 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in longterm debt levels 

 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

 

weakness in the united states and international economies could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments economic downturns can cause customers to idle or close facilities delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase grainger’s products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments thus a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth and results of operations the recent global economic crisis has had a negative effect on grainger’s sales and could continue to do so into the future however the duration of this or any other economic downturn cannot be predicted 

 

the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger’s products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses and retail enterprises competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger’s sales and profitability 

 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins some of grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commoditypriced materials such as steel copper or oil and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market grainger’s ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions the inability to pass along costs increases could result in lower operating margins in addition higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 

 

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 3000 key suppliers no one of which accounts for more than 5 of purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply however economic downturns can adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

  

  

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth grainger from time to time expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes in 2006 grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program the continued success of the expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2009 and beyond the success of these expansions will depend on grainger’s ability to accurately forecast market demand obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain as such there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business although grainger’s information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable grainger’s ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected 

 

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies grainger’s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency could have an adverse effect on reported results of operations foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on sales future costs or on future cash flows from international operations and could adversely affect reported financial performance

 item 3 legal proceedings 

grainger has been named along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies as a defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos andor silica these lawsuits typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos andor silica as a consequence of products purportedly distributed by grainger as of february 3 2009 grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of approximately 2200 plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to asbestos andor silica grainger has denied or intends to deny the allegations in all of the abovedescribed lawsuits 

 

in 2008 lawsuits relating to asbestos andor silica and involving approximately 660 plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to grainger typically based on the lack of product identification if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer in addition grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance grainger has entered agreements with its major insurance carriers relating to the scope coverage and costs of defense while grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on grainger’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

grainger is a party to a contract with the united states general services administration the “gsa” first entered into in 1999 and subsequently extended in 2004 the gsa contract had been the subject of an audit performed by the gsa’s office of the inspector general in december 2007 the company received a letter from the commercial litigation branch of the civil division of the department of justice the “doj” regarding the gsa contract the letter suggested that the company had not complied with its disclosure obligations and the contract’s pricing provisions and had potentially overcharged government customers under the contract 

 

discussions relating to the company’s compliance with its disclosure obligations and the contract’s pricing provisions are ongoing the timing and outcome of these discussions are uncertain and could include settlement or civil litigation by the doj to recover among other amounts treble damages and penalties under the false claims act while this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position an unfavorable resolution could result in significant payments by the company the company continues to believe that it has complied with the gsa contract in all material respects 

 

in addition to the foregoing from time to time grainger is involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to its business including claims relating to product liability general negligence environmental issues employment intellectual property and other matters as a government contractor grainger is also subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings including those related to pricing compliance it is not expected that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on grainger’s consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

overview 

general grainger distributes facilities maintenance products and provides services and related information used by businesses and institutions primarily in the united states canada and mexico to keep their facilities and equipment running grainger reports its operating results in three segments grainger branchbased acklands – grainger branchbased acklands – grainger and lab safety supply inc lab safety grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches sales representatives direct marketing including catalogs and a variety of electronic and internet channels grainger serves customers through 617 branches 18 distribution centers and multiple web sites 

 

business environment several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger’s business environment the current overall economy and leading economic indicators provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in forming the development of projections for the upcoming year in february 2009 consensus forecastusa projected a 2009 gdp decline of 21 and an industrial production decline of 72 for the united states as compared to 2008 gdp growth of 13 and a 17 decline in industrial production in february 2009 consensus forecastusa projected a gdp decline of 11 for canada as compared to the 2008 growth estimate of 06 

 

historically grainger’s sales trends have tended to correlate positively with industrial production growth and nonfarm payrolls in more recent years grainger’s sales growth in the united states has outperformed both economic indicators for the first five months of 2008 grainger benefited from the growth in industrial production and nonfarm payrolls both economic indicators began to deteriorate in may 2008 however grainger continued to outperform both until late 2008 at which time grainger’s sales began to be negatively affected by the economic downturn 

 

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised approximately 25 of grainger’s total 2008 sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels in the united states declined approximately 57 from december 2007 to december 2008 while manufacturing output decreased 99 from december 2007 to december 2008 this decline in manufacturing employment and output contributed to low singledigit sales growth in the light manufacturing customer sector and flat sales growth in the heavy manufacturing customer sector for grainger in 2008 

 

given the steep decline in the economic trends in grainger’s markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 it is difficult to project future results during the fourth quarter grainger began implementing contingency plans to deal with the changing environment which included a hiring freeze on all noncustomerfacing positions a reduction in hours of parttime employees and a significant reduction to travel consulting and relocation expenses in response to a continuing decline in sales on february 11 2009 grainger announced plans to freeze salaries of all executives and salaried employees and indicated that the payment of management incentive bonuses for 2009 would occur only if grainger meets aggressive sales targets additionally grainger announced 300 to 400 jobs would be eliminated as a result of lower sales volume and the combination of its lab safety supply and grainger industrial supply businesses resulting in annualized cost savings of between 25 million and 35 million see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2004 grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program in the united states to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer the expansion program was completed in 2008 however the benefits realized from this initiative are expected to continue 

 

in 2006 grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program in the united states over the past three years grainger has added over 150000 new products to supplement industrial supply’s plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines the product line expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2007 and 2008 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2009 and beyond in 2009 grainger expects to add 50000 new products to further supplement industrial supply’s product lines 

 

grainger’s financial strength enables it to fund major initiatives acquisitions and productivity improvements capital spending in 2008 for the us market expansion program was approximately 40 million with total capital expenditures of 196 million 

 

capital expenditures are expected to range from 175 million to 200 million in 2009 projected investments include improved infrastructure in distribution centers both in the us and canada information technology including 

  

  

upgraded electronic commerce platforms and the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2009 capital investments from operating cash flows with spending planned for the following major projects

the following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

grainger branchbased 

net sales were 53525 million for 2007 an increase of 4417 million or 90 when compared with net sales of 49108 million for 2006 daily sales were up 86 daily sales in the united states were up 85 with growth in all customer end markets led by sales growth in the upper teens in the government sector and high singledigit sales growth in the commercial sector approximately 4 percentage points of the sales growth came from grainger’s ongoing strategic initiatives market expansion and product line expansion the winddown of grainger’s low margin integrated supply contracts reduced sales growth by approximately 1 percentage point 

 

in 2004 grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers market expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the sales growth for the segment results for the market expansion program were as follows 

 

 

product line expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the growth in the segment over the past two years grainger has added approximately 90000 new products in the plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines as part of its ongoing product line expansion initiative 

 

daily sales in mexico increased 227 in 2007 versus 2006 in local currency daily sales were up 228 driven primarily by the ongoing branch expansion program and an improved economy 

 

the segment gross profit margin increased 04 percentage point in 2007 over 2006 driven primarily by positive inflation recovery partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix 

 

operating expenses in this segment were up 90 in 2007 expenses grew at the same rate as sales with payroll and benefits growing at a slower rate than sales offset by other operating expenses growing faster than sales primarily due to increased bad debt expense and provisions and higher facility costs related to market expansion 

 

for the segment operating earnings of 6694 million for 2007 increased 128 over the 5935 million for 2006 this earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin 

 

acklands – grainger branchbased 

net sales at acklands – grainger were 6365 million for 2007 an increase of 714 million or 126 when compared with 5651 million for 2006 daily sales were up 122 in local currency daily sales increased 58 due to a stronger economy this increase was led by the mining sector with sales growth in the low twenties high singledigit sales growth in the oil sector and mid singledigit sales growth in the government sector these increases were partially offset by a midteens sales decline in the forestry sector 

 

the gross profit margin increased 26 percentage points in 2007 over 2006 the improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to positive inflation recovery 

 

operating expenses were up 67 in 2007 expenses grew at a slower rate than sales due to operating expense leverage the result of improved cost management and lower severance costs 

 

operating earnings of 442 million for 2007 were up 290 million or 190 this earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than sales 

 

lab safety 

net sales at lab safety were 4347 million for 2007 an increase of 232 million or 56 when compared with 4115 million for 2006 daily sales were up 52 sales from the acquisitions made during 2007 and late 2006 contributed 61 percentage points to the growth 

 

the gross profit margin decreased 05 percentage point in 2007 over 2006 gross profit margin was down as a result of increased freight costs and unfavorable selling price category mix and product mix partially offset by positive inflation recovery 

 

operating expenses were 46 higher in 2007 and grew at a slower rate than sales due to cost management efforts 

 

operating earnings of 543 million for 2007 were up 38 over 2006 this earnings improvement was less than the sales growth rate primarily due to a lower gross profit margin 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 112 million of income in 2007 a decrease of 138 million as compared with 250 million of income in 2006 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars 

 

 

 

the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances due to working capital needs and share repurchases there was a decrease in equity in net income of unconsolidated entities in 2007 versus 2006 primarily driven by the absence of earnings related to the joint venture that was sold 

 

income taxes 

income taxes of 2617 million in 2007 increased 192 as compared with 2196 million in 2006 

 

grainger’s effective tax rates were 384 and 364 in 2007 and 2006 respectively excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities the effective income tax rates were 385 for 2007 and 367 for 2006 

 

the 2006 tax rate benefited from resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property buildings and equipment 

 

excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities and the tax benefits noted above the effective income tax rate for 2006 was 389 

 

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as pay cash dividends 

 

cash flow 

net cash flows from operations of 5301 million in 2008 4689 million in 2007 and 4368 million in 2006 continued to improve grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding net cash provided by operations increased 612 million in 2008 over 2007 driven primarily by increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisitions used cash of 1431 million in 2008 this use of cash was driven primarily by an increase in inventory due to the product line expansion initiative 

 

the increase in net cash flows from operations from 2006 to 2007 of 321 million was primarily attributable to increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisitions used cash of 1064 million in 2007 this use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable as well as a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the timing of payments at yearend the increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable were due to product line expansion and increased sales these changes were partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities due to higher compensation benefit and profit sharing accruals the result of increased headcount and improved company performance 

 

net cash flows used in investing activities were 2026 million 1970 million and 1397 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively cash expended for property buildings equipment and capitalized software was 1950 million 1974 million and 1368 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below in 2008 grainger continued to fund the company’s market expansion initiative 40 million and acquired two companies highsmith and excel 343 million in 2007 grainger funded the market expansion initiative 88 million purchased mcfeely’s 47 million and purchased its distribution center in china 67 million 

 

net cash flows used in financing activities for 2008 2007 and 2006 were 368 million 5139 million and 4929 million respectively treasury stock purchases were 3942 million in 2008 as grainger repurchased 55 million shares compared to purchases of 6473 million in 2007 to repurchase 72 million shares as of december 31 2008 approximately 74 million shares of common stock remained available under grainger’s repurchase authorization dividends paid to shareholders were 1215 million in 2008 versus 1131 million in 2007 grainger also used cash in 

  

  

financing activities to pay off 814 million of shortterm borrowings versus an increase in shortterm borrowings of 1023 million in 2007 partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds of longterm borrowings of 500 million in 2008 as well as proceeds and excess tax benefits realized from stock options exercised of 604 million in 2008 versus 1442 million in 2007 

 

treasury stock purchases were 4728 million for 70 million shares and dividends paid to shareholders were 979 million in 2006 partially offsetting these cash outlays was proceeds and excess tax benefits realized from stock options exercised of 778 million for 2006 

 

working capital 

internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and of funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated in addition funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

 

working capital was 13824 million at december 31 2008 compared with 9744 million at december 31 2007 and 11558 million at december 31 2006 at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 28 22 and 26 the increase in the current ratio and working capital for 2008 primarily relates to increases in cash and inventories and the replacement of shortterm borrowings with longterm borrowings 

 

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars 

 

 

 

in 2008 grainger completed its investments in the market expansion program in the united states which realigned branches in the top 25 major metropolitan areas in addition there was continued international investment including branch expansion in mexico as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

 

in 2007 and 2006 grainger’s investments included the market expansion program mexico and china expansion and the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

 

capital expenditures are expected to range from 175 million to 200 million in 2009 projected investments include improved infrastructure in distribution centers both in the us and canada information technology including upgraded electronic commerce platforms and the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2009 capital investments from operating cash flows 

 

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including bank borrowings under lines of credit a fouryear bank term loan of 500 million was obtained in may 2008 at december 31 2008 grainger’s longterm debt rating by standard  poor’s was aa grainger’s available lines of credit as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements were 2500 million at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 207 50 and 04 as of the same dates the increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization in 2008 was primarily the result of the 500 million bank term loan grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2008 grainger’s contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows in thousands of dollars  

 

 

 

purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

 

other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections other employmentrelated benefits costs of 310 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

see also notes 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

 

grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of 263 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31 2008 this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in grainger’s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made which would have a material impact on the presentation of grainger’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

 

note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts  grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer 

  

  

writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 

 

inventory reserves   grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger’s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 

 

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger’s results of operations 

stock incentive plans grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value estimate of options granted used the following assumptions 

 

 

 

the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of grainger’s stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant the dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

 

the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

 

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 

 

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

postretirement healthcare benefits  postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs as of december 31 2008 grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of   its postretirement plan obligation from 65 to 59 to reflect the decrease in market interest rates grainger estimates that the decrease in the expected discount rate will decrease 2009 pretax earnings by approximately 25 million although other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poor’s 500 index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2008 grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax at 40 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

  

  

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december 31 2008 results in thousands of dollars 

 

 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

 

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and therefore may affect grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future expense 

 

for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

insurance reserves   grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

 

grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 

 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations 

 

income taxes grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management’s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects grainger’s best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

 

other   other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

new accounting standards 

the following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on grainger upon adoption 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas no 141r sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas no 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will be applied to acquisitions after adoption by the company 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51 sfas no 160 sfas no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the 

parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the company currently does not have any noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements therefore does not expect the adoption of sfas no 160 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 

 

in june 2008 the fasb issued staff position eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” fsp 0361 fsp 0361 states that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method upon adoption a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data presentation to conform with the fsp 0361 provisions fsp 0361 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 

 

the company’s unvested sharebased payment awards such as performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends meet the criteria of a participating security as defined by fsp 0361 accordingly the adoption of fsp 0361 will change the methodology of computing the company’s earnings per share to the twoclass method this change will not affect previously reported consolidated net earnings or net cash flows from operations under the twoclass method earnings will be allocated between common stock and participating securities resulting in lower earnings per share refer to the table below for further analysis of the impact adoption would have had on 2008 earnings per share 

 

 

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of new accounting standards 

 

inflation and changing prices 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

 

the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost accumulates for these longlived assets the related depreciation expense associated with these assets would likely increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 

 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws grainger has generally identified such forwardlooking statements by using words such as “anticipate anticipated assumed assumes assumption assumptions believe believes contingency continue continued continues could estimate estimated estimates expect expectation expected expects forecasts intended intends may might percent complete planned predict predictable predicted presumption project projected projecting projection projections potential reasonably likely scheduled should unlikely will and would” or similar expressions 

 

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause grainger’s results to differ materially from those which are presented 

 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers loss or disruption of source of supply increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries audits and changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general global economic conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility commodity price volatility labor shortages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

  

  

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger’s forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies for 2008 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 26 million decrease in net earnings comparatively in 2007 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 21 million decrease in net earnings a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 31 million increase in net earnings for 2008 as compared with an increase in net earnings of 26 million for 2007 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

 

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio during 2008 and 2007 all of its longterm debt was variable rate debt a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 25 million for 2008 and 03 million for 2007 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 25 million for 2008 and 03 million for 2007 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in longterm debt levels 

 

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale but does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 

  

a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments grainger’s sales growth has tended to correlate with commercial activity manufacturing output and nonfarm employment levels thus a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth 

  

the facilities maintenance industry is a highly fragmented industry and competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger’s products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses and retail enterprises competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger’s sales and profitability 

  

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 3000 key suppliers no one of which accounts for more than 5 of purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger’s reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

  

a delay in the completion or lower than projected results from grainger’s multiyear market expansion program could negatively affect anticipated future sales growth in 2004 grainger launched a six phase market expansion program in the united states to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer the program is being implemented in these markets in a phased approach the success of the market expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2008 and beyond the first phase of the market expansion program was completed in 2005 the second third and fourth phases of the market expansion program were completed in 2007 phases five and six were more than 50 complete at december 31 2007 and are expected to be completed during 2008 a delay in the completion of the program or lower than projected results from the program could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

  

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth grainger from time to time expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes in 2006 grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program the success of the expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2008 and beyond the success of these expansions will depend on grainger’s ability to accurately forecast market demand obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain 

  

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues or both the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business although grainger’s information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable grainger’s ability to process orders identify business opportunities maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected 

  

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies grainger’s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

  

changes in accounting standards subjective assumptions and estimates used by management related to complex accounting matters could have an adverse effect on results of operations generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidance and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters such as stockbased compensation insurance and inventory reserves income taxes and postretirement healthcare benefits are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management changes in these rules or their interpretations or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by management could significantly change reported results

business environment several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger’s business environment the current overall economy and leading economic indicators provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in forming the development of projections for the upcoming year consensus forecastusa projected 2008 gdp growth of 16 and industrial production growth of 11 for the united states a decrease from 2007 estimates of 22 and 19 respectively for canada consensus forecastusa projected 2008 gdp growth of 18 below the 2007 estimate of 26 

  

in 2007 grainger benefited from the economic growth in the united states grainger’s sales correlate positively with industrial production growth with the improvement in industrial production and general growth in the economy grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer sectors grainger’s sales also tend to increase when nonfarm payrolls 

grow especially during economic recoveries nonfarm payrolls increased approximately 1 on average in 2007 over 2006 for 2007 grainger benefited from the combination of increased industrial production and nonfarm payroll growth 

  

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised more than 25 of grainger’s total 2007 sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels in the united states declined approximately 1 on average in 2007 from 2006 however manufacturing output increased approximately 2 this contributed to mid singledigit sales growth in the heavy manufacturing and light manufacturing customer sectors for grainger in 2007

in 2004 grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers 

market expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the sales growth for the segment results for the market expansion program were as follows 

  

 

  

product line expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the growth in the segment over the past two years grainger has added approximately 90000 new products in the plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines as part of its ongoing product line expansion initiative 

  

daily sales in mexico increased 227 in 2007 versus 2006 in local currency daily sales were up 228 driven primarily by the ongoing branch expansion program and an improved economy 

  

the segment gross profit margin increased 04 percentage point in 2007 over 2006 driven primarily by positive inflation recovery partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix 

  

operating expenses in this segment were up 90 in 2007 expenses grew at the same rate as sales with payroll and benefits growing at a slower rate than sales offset by other operating expenses growing faster than sales primarily due to increased bad debt expense and provisions and higher facility costs related to market expansion 

  

for the segment operating earnings of 6694 million for 2007 increased 128 over the 5935 million for 2006 this earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin 

  

acklands – grainger branchbased

the gross profit margin increased 26 percentage points in 2007 over 2006 the improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to positive inflation recovery 

  

operating expenses were up 67 in 2007 expenses grew at a slower rate than sales due to operating expense leverage the result of improved cost management and lower severance costs 

  

operating earnings of 442 million for 2007 were up 290 million or 190 this earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than sales

operating expenses were 46 higher in 2007 and grew at a slower rate than sales due to cost management efforts 

  

operating earnings of 543 million for 2007 were up 38 over 2006 this earnings improvement was less than the sales growth rate primarily due to a lower gross profit margin 

other income and expense

the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances due to working capital needs and share repurchases there was a decrease in equity in net income of unconsolidated entities in 2007 versus 2006 primarily driven by the absence of earnings related to the joint venture that was sold 

  

income taxes 

income taxes of 2617 million in 2007 increased 192 as compared with 2196 million in 2006 

  

grainger’s effective tax rates were 384 and 364 in 2007 and 2006 respectively excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities the effective income tax rates were 385 for 2007 and 367 for 2006 

  

the 2006 tax rate benefited from resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property buildings and equipment 

  

excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities and the tax benefits noted above the effective income tax rate for 2006 was 389 

  

for 2008 grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 39 excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

grainger’s net sales for 2006 of 58837 million were up 65 versus 2005 there was one less selling day in 2006 versus 2005 daily sales were up 69 the increase in net sales was led by low doubledigit sales growth in the government sector high singledigit sales growth in the manufacturing sector and mid singledigit sales growth in the commercial sector also contributing to the improvement was growth from the us market expansion and product line expansion programs partially offsetting these sales improvements was the negative effect of the continued winddown of low margin contracts with integrated supply and automotive customers 

  

the gross profit margin of 400 in 2006 improved 09 percentage point over the gross profit margin of 391 in 2005 principally due to selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix including the global sourcing of products the major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers which carry lower than average gross profit margins 

  

grainger’s operating earnings of 5781 million in 2006 increased 591 million or 114 over the prior year the operating margin of 98 in 2006 improved 04 percentage point over 2005 as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses operating expenses were up 81 in 2006 principally due to higher payroll and benefits driven by increased stockbased compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas no 123r and increased healthcare and profit sharing costs partially offset by lower systems implementation costs 

  

in 2006 net earnings of 3834 million increased 371 million or 107 over the prior year the growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings and higher net interest income partially offset by an increase in income tax expense diluted earnings per share for 2006 of 424 were 122 higher than the 378 for 2005 the result of higher net earnings and fewer shares outstanding

daily sales in mexico increased 201 in 2006 versus 2005 in local currency daily sales were up 210 driven by an improving economy an expanded telesales operation new branches in santa catarina and chihuahua and an expanded presence in tijuana 

  

segment gross profit margin increased 11 percentage points in 2006 over the comparable 2005 period primarily driven by positive inflation recovery and a positive change in selling price category mix a major driver in the improvement in selling price category mix was the reduction of sales related to low margin integrated supply and automotive contracts 

  

operating expenses were up 64 for 2006 the operating expense growth was primarily driven by higher payroll and benefits costs due to higher stockbased compensation related to the adoption of sfas no 123r and higher profit sharing costs partially offset by lower systems implementation costs 

  

operating earnings of 5935 million for 2006 increased 136 over the 5226 million for 2005 the earnings improvement resulted from higher sales and improved gross profit margins partially offset by operating expenses which grew at a faster rate than sales

net sales at lab safety were 4115 million for 2006 an increase of 314 million or 83 when compared with 3801 million for 2005 daily sales were up 87 the sales growth included the benefit of incremental sales from rand acquired on january 31 2006 and professional equipment and construction book acquired on november 17 2006 as well as sales growth in the manufacturing sector rand contributed 40 percentage points to the daily sales increase professional equipment and construction book contributed 06 percentage point to the daily sales increase excluding rand professional equipment and construction book daily sales increased 41 

  

the gross profit margin decreased 03 percentage point in 2006 from 2005 primarily as a result of increased freight costs and lower margin rand product sales partially offset by positive inflation recovery 

operating expenses of 1218 million were 128 million or 117 higher in 2006 primarily due to incremental costs associated with the acquisitions higher advertising costs and increased expenses from the upgrade of the business’ enterprise resource planning system 

  

operating earnings of 523 million for 2006 were down 08 compared to 2005 resulting from a lower gross profit margin and higher operating expenses partially offset by increased sales

the increase in interest income in 2006 was the result of higher interest rates and higher average cash balances 

  

income taxes 

income taxes of 2196 million in 2006 increased 179 as compared with 1864 million in 2005 

  

grainger’s effective tax rates were 364 and 350 in 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding the effect of equity in net income of unconsolidated entities the effective income tax rates were 367 for 2006 and 352 for 2005

the 2005 tax rate included tax benefits related to a favorable revision to the estimate of income taxes for various state and local taxing jurisdictions and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies 

  

excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities and the tax benefits noted above the effective income tax rate was 389 for 2006 and 370 for 2005 

  

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures acquisitions and repurchase of shares as well as pay cash dividends 

  

cash flow 

net cash flows from operations of 4689 million in 2007 4368 million in 2006 and 4325 million in 2005 continued to improve grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding net cash provided by operations increased 321 million in 2007 over 2006 driven primarily by increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisitions used cash of 1064 million in 2007 this use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable as well as a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the timing of payments at yearend the increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable were due to product line expansion and increased sales these changes were partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities due to higher compensation benefit and profit sharing accruals the result of increased headcount and improved company performance the increase in net cash flows from operations from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributable to increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisitions used cash of 972 million in 2006 this use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable which were up due to increased sales and an increase in days sales outstanding these changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases 

  

net cash flows used in investing activities were 1970 million 1397 million and 1630 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively capital expenditures for property buildings equipment and capitalized software were 1974 million 1368 million and 1572 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below in 2007 grainger continued to fund the company’s market expansion initiative 88 million purchased mcfeely’s 47 million and purchased its distribution center in china 67 million in 2006 grainger also invested 139 million to purchase rand and 205 million to purchase 

  

professional equipment and construction book which are part of the lab safety segment the results of operations for the acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective acquisition dates 

  

net cash flows used in financing activities for 2007 2006 and 2005 were 5139 million 4929 million and 1541 million respectively treasury stock purchases increased 1745 million in 2007 as grainger repurchased 7051607 shares compared with 6950900 shares in 2006 treasury stock purchases were 2404400 shares in 2005 as of december 31 2007 approximately 47 million shares of common stock remained available under grainger’s repurchase authorization dividends paid to shareholders were 1131 million in 2007 979 million in 2006 and 827 million in 2005 partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds and excess tax benefits realized from stock options exercised of 1442 million 778 million and 660 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

working capital 

internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated in addition funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

  

working capital was 9744 million at december 31 2007 compared with 11558 million at december 31 2006 and 12902 million at december 31 2005 at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 22 26 and 29 respectively the current ratio and working capital decrease in 2007 was due to the increase in shortterm borrowings and a reduction in cash primarily to fund the accelerated share repurchase program see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table 

  

 

  

in 2007 and 2006 grainger’s investments included the market expansion program which is designed to realign branches in several metropolitan markets mexico and china expansion and the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

  

in 2005 grainger’s investments included the market expansion program ongoing sap initiatives expenditures related to canadian branch and systems projects as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

  

capital expenditures are expected to range from 175 million to 200 million in 2008 these projected investments include the completion of the market expansion program in the united states branch expansion in mexico ongoing information technology expenditures support for the product line expansion program as well as other general projects including the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2008 capital investments from operating cash flows which grainger believes will remain strong 

  

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit at december 31 2007 grainger’s longterm debt rating by standard  poor’s was aa grainger’s available lines of credit as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements were 2500 million at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 50 04 and 04 as of the same dates the increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily the result of shortterm borrowings used to fund an accelerated share repurchase program see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of grainger’s accelerated share repurchase program 

  

grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position certain holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require grainger to redeem these bonds thus a portion is classified as current maturities of longterm debt 

  

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2007 grainger’s contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 

  

 

  

purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

  

payments for other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections other employmentrelated benefits costs of 338 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

see also notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to longterm debt and operating lease obligations respectively 

  

in addition grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of 147 million for tax uncertainties at december 31 2007 this amount is excluded from the table above as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in grainger’s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

  

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

  

note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts  grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer 

writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 

  

inventory reserves grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger’s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 

  

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger’s results of operations 

  

stock incentive plans grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants the model requires projections of the riskfree interest rate expected life volatility expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants the fair value of options granted in 2007 and 2006 used the following assumptions 

  

 

  

the riskfree interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of grainger’s stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant the dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures using historical forfeiture experience 

  

the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 

  

compensation expense for other stockbased awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 

  

for additional information concerning stock incentive plans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

postretirement healthcare benefits  postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

  

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs as of december 31 2007 grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 59 to 65 to reflect the increase in market interest rates grainger estimates that the increase in the expected discount rate will increase 2008 pretax earnings by approximately 24 million although other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

  

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poor’s 500 index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2007 grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax at 40 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

a 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on december 31 2007 results 

 

  

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

  

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and therefore may affect grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future expense 

  

for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

insurance reserves grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

  

grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 

  

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations 

  

income taxes grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management’s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects grainger’s best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

  

other other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies such as revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new accounting standards 

the following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on grainger upon adoption 

  

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return it also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition grainger adopted fin 48 on january 1 2007 and the adoption did not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fin 48 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting 

principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of sfas no 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 grainger does not expect adoption of sfas no 157 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas no 159 sfas no 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies using different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 grainger does not expect adoption of sfas no 159 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas no 141r sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas no 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will be applied to acquisitions after adoption by grainger 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51 sfas no 160 sfas no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 grainger is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas no 160 may have on its results of operations or financial position 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of new accounting standards 

  

inflation and changing prices 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

  

the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost accumulates for these longlived assets the related depreciation expense associated with these assets would likely increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 

  

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

  

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forwardlooking statements” under the federal securities laws grainger has generally identified such forwardlooking statements by using words such as “believe expect anticipate continue estimate intend planned predict projection potential scheduled assumption presumption may might would could and will” or similar expressions 

  

grainger cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forwardlooking statements are reasonable achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause grainger’s results to differ materially from those which are presented 

  

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forwardlooking statement include without limitation higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers increased competitive pricing pressures failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings changes in laws and regulations disruption of information technology or data security systems general industry or market conditions general economic conditions labor shortages facilities disruptions or shutdowns higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and the factors identified in item 1a risk factors 

  

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger’s forwardlooking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies for 2007 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 21 million decrease in net earnings comparatively in 2006 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 10 million decrease in net earnings a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 26 million increase in net earnings for 2007 as compared with an increase in net earnings of 12 million for 2006 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

  

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio during 2007 and 2006 all of its longterm debt was variable rate debt a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately 03 million for 2007 and 01 million for 2006 a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately 03 million for 2007 and 01 million for 2006 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in longterm debt levels 

  

grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly

competition

grainger provides local product availability sales representatives competitive pricing catalogs which include product descriptions and in certain cases extensive technical and application data electronic and internet commerce technology and other services to assist customers in lowering their total facility maintenance costs grainger believes that it can effectively compete with manufacturers on small orders but manufacturers may have an advantage in filling large orders 

  

grainger serves a number of diverse markets based on available data grainger estimates the north american market for facilities maintenance and related products to be more than 145 billion of which grainger’s share is approximately 4 percent there are several large competitors although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

  

a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environments grainger’s sales growth has tended to correlate with commercial activity manufacturing output and nonfarm employment levels thus a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth 

  

the facilities maintenance industry is a highly fragmented industry and competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger’s products and services there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses and retail enterprises competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger’s sales and profitability 

  

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from approximately 1600 key suppliers no one of which accounts for more than 10 of purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse effect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

  

a delay in the implementation of grainger’s multiyear market expansion program could negatively affect anticipated future sales growth in 2004 grainger launched a six phase market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer the program is being 

  

implemented in these markets in a phased approach the success of the market expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2007 and beyond the first phase of the market expansion program was completed in 2005 phases two through six were in various stages of completion at december 31 2006 a delay in the implementation of the program or lower than projected results from the program could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

  

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth grainger from time to time expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes in 2006 grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program the success of the expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2007 and beyond the success of these expansions will depend on grainger’s ability to accurately forecast market demand and to obtain product from suppliers 

  

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues or both the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business although grainger’s information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable grainger’s ability to process orders identify business opportunities maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and pay expenses could be adversely affected 

  

in order to compete grainger must attract retain and motivate key employees and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in order to compete and have continued growth grainger must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions there is no assurance that grainger will continue to be able to hire or retain key employees grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies granger’s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs

grainger has been named along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies as a defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos andor silica these lawsuits typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos andor silica as a consequence of products purportedly distributed by grainger as of january 17 2007 grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of approximately 3100 plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to asbestos andor silica in addition five cases alleging exposure to cotton dust were amended during 2004 to add allegations relating to asbestos but during 2006 the pleadings in those cases were amended and no longer contain allegations of asbestos exposure 

  

grainger has denied or intends to deny the allegations in all of the abovedescribed lawsuits in 2006 lawsuits relating to asbestos andor silica and involving approximately 300 plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to grainger typically based on the lack of product identification if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer in addition grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance grainger is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers regarding the scope and amount of coverage while grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on grainger’s consolidated financial position or results of operations

when grainger first began using the former peer group index in its stock performance graph one of the principal constituent companies of the index was hughes supply inc hughes supply inc was acquired during 2006 and as a result is no longer publicly traded and no longer part of the index grainger believes that the dow jones wilshire 5000 industrial supplier index – which includes all of the current constituent companies in the former peer group index as well as a number of other businesses – now provides a more representative comparator group the graph covers the period commencing december 31 2001 and ending december 31 2006 the graph assumes that the value for the investment in grainger common stock and in each index was 100 on december 31 2001 and that all dividends were reinvested

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

general grainger is the leading broadline supplier of facilities maintenance and other related products in north america for each of the three years presented in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2006 grainger reports its operating results in three segments grainger branchbased acklands – grainger branchbased acklands – grainger and lab safety supply inc lab safety grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches sales representatives direct marketing including catalogs and a variety of electronic and internet channels grainger serves customers through a network of 593 branches 18 distribution centers and multiple web sites 

  

business environment several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger’s business environment the current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in forming the development of projections for the upcoming year at the start of 2007 consensus forecastusa predicted 2007 gdp growth of 24 and industrial production growth of 25 for the united states a slight decrease from preliminary fourth quarter 2006 gdp estimates for canada consensus forecastusa predicted 2007 gdp growth of 23 below the 2006 estimate of 27 

  

in 2006 grainger benefited from the economic growth in the united states grainger’s sales correlate positively with industrial production growth with the improvement in industrial production and general growth in the economy grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer sectors grainger’s sales also tend to increase when nonfarm payrolls grow especially during economic recoveries nonfarm payrolls increased approximately 1 on average in 2006 over 2005 for 2006 grainger benefited from the combination of increased industrial production and nonfarm payroll growth 

  

the light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors which comprised more than 25 of grainger’s total 2006 sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels in the united states were flat during 2006 however manufacturing output increased almost 5 this contributed to almost doubledigit sales growth in the heavy manufacturing and mid singledigit sales growth in the light manufacturing customer sectors for grainger in 2006 economic forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector will continue to expand in 2007 

  

in 2004 grainger launched a multiyear initiative to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer the market expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2006 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2007 and beyond the first phase of the market expansion program was completed in 2005 phases two through six were in various stages of completion at december 31 2006 

  

in 2006 grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program the product line expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2006 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2007 and beyond in 2007 the company plans to add approximately 25000 additional products to supplement the plumbing fastener material handling and security product lines 

  

customer buying behavior is also important in grainger’s business environment grainger believes that customers will continue to focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products consequently during 2006 grainger increased information available to employees for improved service to customers by installing an upgraded sap branch operating system as part of an overall conversion to an integrated sap system in the us branchbased business

grainger’s net sales for 2006 of 58837 million were up 65 versus 2005 there was one less selling day in 2006 versus 2005 daily sales were up 69 the increase in net sales was led by strong sales to the commercial government and manufacturing sectors also contributing to the improvement was growth from the us market expansion program partially offsetting these sales improvements was the negative effect of the continued winddown of low margin contracts with integrated supply and automotive customers 

  

the gross profit margin of 400 in 2006 improved 09 percentage point over the gross profit margin of 391 in 2005 principally due to selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix including the global sourcing of products the major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers which carry lower than average gross profit margins 

  

grainger’s operating earnings of 5781 million in 2006 increased 591 million or 114 over the prior year the operating margin of 98 in 2006 improved 04 percentage point over 2005 as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses operating expenses were up 81 in 2006 principally due to higher payroll and benefits driven by increased stockbased compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas no 123r and increased healthcare and profit sharing costs partially offset by lower systems implementation costs 

  

in 2006 net earnings of 3834 million increased 371 million or 107 over the prior year the growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings and higher net interest income partially offset by an increase in income tax expense diluted earnings per share for 2006 of 424 were 122 higher than the 378 for 2005 the result of higher net income and fewer shares outstanding

grainger’s effective tax rates were 364 and 350 in 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding the effect of equity in unconsolidated entities which is recorded net of tax the effective income tax rates were 367 for 2006 and 352 for 2005 

  

the 2006 tax rate benefited from resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property buildings and equipment 

  

the 2005 tax rate included tax benefits related to a favorable revision to the estimate of income taxes for various state and local taxing jurisdictions and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies 

  

for 2007 grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be 385 excluding the effects of equity in unconsolidated entities 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

grainger’s net sales for 2005 of 55266 million were up 94 versus 2004 the increase in net sales was led by strong sales to the commercial government manufacturing and natural resource sectors also contributing to the improvement was growth from the us market expansion program partially offsetting these sales improvements was the negative effect of the winddown of integrated supply and related automotive contracts 

  

the gross profit margin of 391 in 2005 improved 13 percentage points over the gross profit margin of 378 in 2004 principally due to selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix including the global sourcing of products a major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers which carry lower than average gross profit margins 

  

grainger’s operating earnings of 5190 million in 2005 increased 777 million or 176 over the prior year the operating margin of 94 in 2005 improved 07 percentage point over 2004 as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses operating expenses were up 121 in 2005 principally due to higher variable compensation and benefits associated with the improved performance for the year as well as to incremental costs related to the market expansion and information technology programs 

  

in 2005 net earnings of 3463 million increased 594 million or 207 over the prior year the growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings higher net interest income and a lower tax rate diluted earnings per share for 2005 of 378 were 208 higher than the 313 for 2004

as of the fourth quarter of 2005 the company began phase 4 of the program additional phases began in 2006 

  

 

  

overall market expansion contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the segment sales growth the sales growth in phase 1 was negatively affected in the denver market due to lower sales to one large customer excluding the effect of this customer sales in phase 1 were up 13 

  

sales in mexico were up 186 in 2005 as compared to 2004 driven by a strong local economy expanded telesales operations and improved sales to national accounts

operating expenses for the grainger branchbased businesses increased 113 in 2005 operating expenses were up primarily as a result of payroll and benefits costs payroll increases were due to higher headcount to support strategic initiatives including the market expansion program and information technology upgrades in addition sales commissions and profit sharing accruals increased due to the improved 2005 performance partially offsetting these increases was lower bad debt expense the result of improved collections and reduced writeoffs 

  

in 2005 operating earnings of 5226 million increased by 781 million or 176 over 2004 the improvement was the result of sales growth combined with the improvement in gross profit margin and was partially offset by operating expenses which grew faster than sales 

  

acklands – grainger branchbased 

net sales at acklands – grainger of 5020 million increased by 156 in 2005 compared to 2004 net sales of 4343 million including the effect of a favorable canadian exchange rate in local currency sales increased 77 primarily due to strength in the canadian economy driven by the natural resources sector

the gross profit margin of 425 increased 07 percentage point when compared to the gross profit margin of 418 for 2004 contributing to the improvement was a favorable selling price category mix partially offset by the negative effect of aw direct sales which carry lower gross profit margins 

  

operating expenses were 1090 million in 2005 up 137 million or 143 over 2004 the increase over the prior year was principally driven by higher variable compensation expense related to the strong performance for the year and higher catalog media costs partially offset by lower data processing expense related to fully amortized enterprise software also contributing to the increase were costs associated with the aw direct acquisition 

  

operating earnings of 527 million were up 159 in 2005 over 2004 resulting primarily from the increase in sales and the improved gross profit margin partially offset by increased operating expenses

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives and capital expenditures and to repurchase shares as well as pay cash dividends at or above historical levels 

  

cash flow 

net cash flows from operations of 4368 million in 2006 4325 million in 2005 and 4065 million in 2004 continued to improve grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding net cash provided by operations increased 43 million in 2006 over 2005 driven primarily by increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisitions and joint venture contributions used cash of 972 million in 2006 the use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable which were up due to increased sales throughout 2006 and an increase in days sales outstanding these changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases the increase in net cash flows from operations from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisitions and joint venture contributions used cash of 571 million in 2005 the use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable which were up due to higher inventory purchases and sales in december these changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases and increases in profit sharing and compensationrelated accruals driven by an improved 2005 performance

net cash flows used in financing activities for 2006 2005 and 2004 were 4929 million 1541 million and 2406 million respectively treasury stock purchases increased 3353 million in 2006 as grainger repurchased 6950900 shares compared with 2404400 shares in 2005 treasury stock purchases were 2001000 shares in 2004 as of december 31 2006 approximately 77 million shares of common stock remained available under grainger’s repurchase authorization dividends paid to shareholders were 979 million in 2006 827 million in 2005 and 712 million in 2004 partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds from stock options exercised of 644 million 660 million and 723 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively during 2004 grainger liquidated its crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt with payments totaling 1408 million 

  

working capital 

internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated in addition funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

  

working capital was 11558 million at december 31 2006 compared with 12902 million at december 31 2005 and 11084 million at december 31 2004 at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 26 29 and 27 respectively 

  

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table 

  

 

  

  

in 2006 grainger’s investments included the market expansion program which is designed to realign branches in several metropolitan markets international expansion and the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

  

in 2005 and 2004 grainger’s investments included the market expansion program ongoing sap initiatives expenditures related to canadian branch and systems projects as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

  

capital expenditures are expected to range from 150 million to 175 million in 2007 and include investments for the ongoing market expansion program information technology international expansion as well as other general projects including the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2007 capital investments from operating cash flows which grainger believes will remain strong 

  

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit at december 31 2006 grainger’s longterm debt rating by standard  poor’s was aa grainger’s available lines of credit as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements were 2500 million at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 04 04 and 05 as of the same dates 

  

grainger entered into a twoyear crosscurrency swap on september 25 2002 on september 27 2004 the crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt matured and were liquidated with payments totaling 1408 million see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition certain holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require grainger to redeem these bonds thus a portion is classified as current maturities of longterm debt 

  

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2006 grainger’s contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 

  

 

  

purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

  

payments for other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections other employmentrelated benefits costs of 323 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not as statistically predictable see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

see also notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in grainger’s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

  

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

  

note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

postretirement healthcare benefits  postretirement obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

  

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs as of december 31 2006 grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 55 to 59 to reflect the increase in market interest rates grainger estimates that the increase in the expected discount rate will increase 2007 pretax earnings by approximately 14 million although other changes in assumptions may increase decrease or eliminate this effect 

  

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poor’s 500 index in developing its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2006 grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax at 40 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

  

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

  

grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and therefore may affect grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future expense 

  

for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

insurance reserves grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

  

grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 

  

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts  grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer 

  

writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 

  

inventory reserves grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger’s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 

  

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger’s results of operations 

  

income taxes grainger accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” under sfas no 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management’s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects grainger’s best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

  

other other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies relating to revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new accounting standards 

the following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on grainger upon adoption 

  

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measure of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return it also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the company does not expect adoption of fin 48 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of sfas no 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company is currently evaluating the impact adoption may have on its results of operations or financial position 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year with limited exceptions and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur sfas no 158 requires funded status changes of a defined benefit postretirement plan within accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax to the extent such changes are not recognized in earnings as components of net periodic benefit costs sfas no 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 the company adopted sfas no 158 during the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of the adoption grainger recorded an additional liability of 368 million to accrued employmentrelated benefit costs offset by 143 million of deferred income taxes and a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive earnings of 225 million see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of information related to sfas no 158 

  

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements” sab no 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the adoption of sab no 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november 15 2006 the company adopted sab no 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006 the adoption of sab no 108 did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of new accounting standards 

  

inflation and changing prices 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

  

the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these longlived assets the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 

  

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

  

forwardlooking statements 

this document contains forwardlooking statements under the federal securities laws the forwardlooking statements relate to grainger’s expected future financial results and business plans strategies and objectives and are not historical facts they are often identified by qualifiers such as “will” “could” “should” “might” “may” “would” “tend” “planned” “presumption” “expects” “intends” “is likely” “anticipates” “scheduled” “believes” “positions it” “continue” “estimates” “forecast” “predicting” “projection” “potential” “ assumption” or similar expressions there are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause grainger’s results to differ materially from what is projected 

  

factors that may affect forwardlooking statements include the following higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers increased competitive pricing pressure on grainger’s businesses failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings relating to claims inquiries or audits changes in laws and regulations facilities disruptions or shutdowns disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance 

  

trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions gross domestic product growth rates general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations global and other conflicts employment levels and other factors 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during a portion of 2004 grainger partially hedged its net canadian dollar investment in acklands – grainger with a crosscurrency swap agreement this agreement was terminated in 2004 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for 2006 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 10 million decrease in net income comparatively in 2005 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 16 million decrease in net income a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 12 million increase in net income for 2006 as compared with an increase in net income of 19 million for 2005 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

  

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio during 2006 and 2005 all of its longterm debt was variable rate debt for both 2006 and 2005 a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately 01 million and a 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to income of approximately 01 million this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or longterm debt levels grainger’s level of interest rate risk has been reduced due to the liquidation of the crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt during 2004 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

grainger is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

  

a slowdown in the economy could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth economic and industry trends affect grainger’s business environment grainger’s sales growth has tended to correlate with commercial activity manufacturing output and nonfarm employment levels thus a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger’s sales growth 

  

the facilities maintenance industry is a highly fragmented industry and competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger’s products there are several large competitors in the industry although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market wholesale distributors catalog houses and certain retail enterprises competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger’s sales and profitability 

  

unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations grainger’s competitive strengths include product selection and availability products are purchased from more than 1200 key suppliers no one of which accounts for more than 10 of purchases historically no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products there could be a shortterm adverse affect on results of operations and a longerterm adverse effect on customer relationships and reputation in addition grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 

  

a delay in the implementation of grainger’s multiyear market expansion program could negatively affect anticipated future sales growth in 2004 grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer the program is being implemented in these markets in a phased approach the success of the market expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2006 and beyond a delay in the implementation of the program or lower than projected results from the program could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 

  

the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth grainger may from time to time expand the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes the success of these expansions will depend on grainger’s ability to accurately forecast market demand and to obtain product from suppliers 

  

  

  

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues or both the proper functioning of grainger’s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business although grainger’s information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable grainger’s ability to process orders identify business opportunities maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable and pay expenses could be adversely affected in january 2006 grainger installed an upgraded sap branch operating system and replaced its legacy information systems for the us branchbased businesses implementation of this system at other grainger businesses is scheduled for future years

grainger has denied or intends to deny the allegations in all of the abovedescribed lawsuits in 2005 lawsuits relating to asbestos andor silica and involving approximately 700 plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to grainger typically based on the lack of product identification if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer in addition grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance grainger is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers regarding the scope and amount of coverage while grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on grainger’s consolidated financial position or results of operations

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

general grainger is the leading broadline supplier of facilities maintenance and other related products in north america for each of the three years presented in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2005 grainger reports its operating results in two segments branchbased distribution and lab safety grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches field sales forces direct marketing including catalogs and a variety of electronic and internet channels grainger serves customers through a network of 589 branches 18 distribution centers and multiple web sites 

  

effective january 1 2005 grainger’s integrated supply business no longer entered into new contracts for onsite integrated purchasing and tool crib management services it was merged into grainger’s industrial supply division within the branchbased distribution segment grainger industrial supply is fulfilling existing integrated supply contracts as such in 2005 integrated supply was no longer reported as a separate segment and grainger reported its operating results in two segments branchbased distribution and lab safety 

  

business environment several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger’s business environment the current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in forming the development of projections for the upcoming year at the start of 2006 the consensus forecastusa predicted gdp and industrial production growth of 34 percent for 2006 although preliminary fourth quarter 2005 gdp estimates reflected a slowdown from prior quarters 

  

in 2005 grainger benefited from the economic recovery in the united states grainger’s sales correlate positively with production growth with the improvement in industrial production and general growth in the economy grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer segments grainger’s sales also tend to increase when nonfarm payrolls grow especially during economic recoveries nonfarm payrolls increased approximately 2 on average in 2005 over 2004 for 2005 grainger benefited from the combination of increased industrial production and nonfarm payroll growth 

  

the light and heavy manufacturing customer segments which comprised over 25 of grainger’s total 2005 sales have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production manufacturing employment levels were flat during 2005 however manufacturing output increased almost 4 this contributed to almost doubledigit sales growth in the light and heavy manufacturing customer segments for grainger in 2005 economic forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector should continue to expand in 2006 

  

in 2004 grainger launched a multiyear initiative to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer the market expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2005 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2006 and beyond the first phase of the market expansion program was completed in 2005 phases two through four were in progress at december 31 2005 additional phases are scheduled for 2006 and beyond 

  

customer buying behavior is also important in grainger’s business environment grainger believes that customers will continue to focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products consequently grainger is increasing information available to employees for improved service to customers by installing an upgraded sap branch operating system and replacing its legacy information systems with a new integrated software package also provided by sap in the us branchbased businesses effective january 30 2006 

  

grainger’s financial strength including its low debt and strong cash flow positions it to fund acquisitions and major initiatives improve effectiveness and accelerate top line growth capital spending in 2005 related to the market expansion program and sap initiative was approximately 88 million with total capital expenditures of more than 157 million 

  

  

  

for 2006 grainger anticipates total capital expenditures of 140 million to 175 million grainger intends to continue its investment in the market expansion program and information technology enhancements with spending planned for the following major projects 

  

      

lease or purchase decisions based on availability of facilities may affect the timing of capital expenditures associated with the market expansion program

2005 compared to 2004 

grainger’s net sales for 2005 of 55266 million were up 94 versus 2004 the increase in net sales was led by strong sales to the commercial government manufacturing and natural resource sectors also contributing to the improvement was growth from the us market expansion program partially offsetting these sales improvements was the negative effect of the winddown of integrated supply and related automotive contracts 

  

the gross profit margin of 391 in 2005 improved 13 percentage points over the gross profit margin of 378 in 2004 principally due to selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix including the global sourcing of products the major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers which carry lower than average gross profit margins 

  

grainger’s operating earnings of 5190 million in 2005 increased 777 million or 176 over the prior year the operating margin of 94 in 2005 improved 07 percentage point over 2004 as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses operating expenses were up 121 in 2005 principally due to higher variable compensation and benefits associated with the improved performance for the year as well as to incremental costs related to the market expansion and information technology programs 

  

in 2005 net earnings of 3463 million increased 594 million or 207 over the prior year the growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings higher net interest income and a lower tax rate diluted earnings per share for 2005 of 378 were 208 higher than the 313 for 2004 

  

  

  

segment analysis 

the following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

branchbased distribution 

net sales of 51502 million in 2005 increased 92 over 2004 net sales of 47162 million sales in the united states were up 84 over the prior year all customer segments increased with the strongest sales growth in the commercial government and manufacturing sectors national account sales which include all customer segments were up 119 the winddown of integrated supply and automotive contracts reduced sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points

 overall market expansion contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the segment sales growth the sales growth in phase 1 was negatively affected in the denver market due to lower sales to one large customer excluding the effect of this customer sales in phase 1 were up 13 

net sales in canada were 156 higher in 2005 than in 2004 benefiting from a favorable canadian exchange rate in local currency sales increased 77 primarily due to strength in the canadian economy driven by the natural resources sector sales in mexico were up 186 in 2005 as compared to 2004 driven by a strong local economy expanded telesales operations and improved sales to national accounts 

cost of merchandise sold of 31495 million increased 1994 million or 68 over 2004 due to increased volume gross profit margins improved 14 percentage points to 388 in 2005 from 374 in 2004 contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix which included the global sourcing of additional products the major driver of the improvement in selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers which carry lower than average gross margins 

operating expenses for the branchbased distribution businesses increased 126 in 2005 operating expenses were up primarily as a result of payroll and benefits costs payroll increases were due to higher headcount to support strategic initiatives including the market expansion program and information technology upgrades in addition sales commissions and profit sharing accruals increased due to the improved 2005 performance partially offsetting these increases was lower bad debt expense the result of improved collections and reduced writeoffs 

in 2005 operating earnings of 5366 million increased by 711 million or 153 over 2004 the improvement was the result of sales growth combined with the improvement in gross profit margin and was partially offset by operating expenses which grew faster than sales 

lab safety 

net sales at lab safety were 3801 million in 2005 an increase of 434 million or 129 when compared with 3367 million of sales in 2004 higher sales were principally driven by incremental sales from aw direct which was acquired on january 14 2005 excluding aw direct sales increased 40 over 2004 

  

the gross profit margin of 425 increased 07 percentage point when compared to the gross profit margin of 418 for 2004 contributing to the improvement was a favorable selling price category mix partially offset by the negative effect of aw direct sales which carry lower gross profit margins 

  

operating expenses were 1090 million in 2005 up 137 million or 143 over 2004 the increase over the prior year was principally driven by higher variable compensation expense related to the strong performance for the year and higher catalog media costs partially offset by lower data processing expense related to fully amortized enterprise software also contributing to the increase were costs associated with the aw direct acquisition 

  

operating earnings of 527 million were up 159 in 2005 over 2004 resulting primarily from the increase in sales and the improved gross profit margin partially offset by increased operating expenses 

  

  

  

  

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 137 million of income in 2005 an improvement of 98 million as compared with 39 million of income in 2004 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense 

  

   

the improvement in other income and expense in 2005 over 2004 was primarily attributable to higher interest income and lower interest expense and improvement in the results of unconsolidated entities the increase in interest income in 2005 was primarily the result of higher interest rates interest expense decreased due to the payment of the crosscurrency debt swap in september 2004 

  

income taxes 

income taxes of 1864 million in 2005 increased 178 as compared with 1582 million in 2004

2004 compared to 2003 

grainger’s net sales for 2004 of 50498 million were up 82 versus 2003 the increase in net sales was a result of the strengthening in the manufacturing and commercial sectors full year results also benefited from the completion of the logistics network upgrade which improved product availability as well as from the launch of the market expansion project an expanded sales force and new communication technology in the us branches the increase in net sales was realized in the branchbased distribution and lab safety segments of the business 

  

the gross profit margin of 378 in 2004 improved 16 percentage points over the gross profit margin of 362 in 2003 principally due to product cost reduction programs including the global sourcing of products combined with selected price increases in 2004 and the positive effect of product mix these margin improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in selling price category mix 

  

grainger’s operating earnings of 4413 million in 2004 increased 524 million or 135 over the prior year the operating margin of 87 in 2004 improved 04 percentage point over 2003 as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses operating expenses were up 125 in 2004 principally due to higher variable compensation and benefits associated with the improved performance for the year as well as to incremental costs related to the market expansion and information technology programs

operating expenses for the branchbased distribution businesses increased 115 in 2004 operating expenses were up primarily as a result of higher sales commissions and bonus and profit sharing accruals associated with the improved 2004 performance as well as increased costs related to strategic initiatives such as the market expansion program and technology upgrades partially offsetting these increases was improved productivity achieved from the redesigned logistics network 

in 2004 operating earnings of 4655 million increased by 698 million or 176 over 2003 the effect of sales growth combined with the improvement in gross profit margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses

net sales at lab safety were 3367 million in 2004 an increase of 312 million or 102 when compared with 3055 million of sales in 2003 higher sales were principally driven by growth in nonsafety products sales through lab safety’s web sites were up 261 in 2004 over 2003 also contributing to the yearoveryear increase were incremental sales from gempler’s which was acquired on april 14 2003 excluding gempler’s sales increased 61 over 2003 

  

the gross profit margin of 418 decreased 04 percentage point when compared to the gross profit margin of 422 for 2003 contributing to the decline was the negative effect of selling price category mix combined with the effect of a full year of gempler’s sales which carry lower than average gross profit margins 

  

operating expenses were 953 million in 2004 up 84 million or 96 over 2003 the increase over the prior year was principally driven by higher variable compensation expense related to the strong performance for the year higher catalog media costs and higher benefits expenses from increases in healthcare costs also contributing to the increase were costs associated with gempler’s for a full year in 2004 versus a partial year in 2003 

  

operating earnings of 455 million were up 86 in 2004 over 2003 resulting primarily from the increase in sales partially offset by the lower gross profit margin and increased operating expenses 

  

  

  

other income and expense 

other income and expense was 39 million of income in 2004 an improvement of 117 million as compared with 78 million of expense in 2003 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense 

  

   

the improvement in other income and expense in 2004 over 2003 was primarily attributable to net interest income in 2004 versus net interest expense in 2003 as well as a 33 million improvement in the results of unconsolidated entities the change to net interest income in 2004 from net interest expense in 2003 was due to the combination of higher interest rates and invested balances together with the reduction in outstanding longterm debt balances additionally 2003 included 19 million in expense for the writeoff of investments in two asian joint ventures and 16 million in expense for the writedown of investment securities see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

income taxes of 1582 million in 2004 increased 27 as compared with 1541 million in 2003 

  

grainger’s effective tax rates were 355 and 404 in 2004 and 2003 respectively excluding the effect of equity in unconsolidated entities and the writeoff of these investments which are recorded net of tax the effective income tax rates were 356 for 2004 and 400 for 2003 the tax rate reduction in 2004 was primarily due to a lower tax in canada the realization of tax benefits related to operations in mexico and to capital losses the recognition of tax benefits from the medicare act and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies 

  

financial condition 

grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives and capital expenditures as well as to repurchase shares and pay cash dividends at or above historical levels 

  

cash flow 

net cash flows from operations of 4325 million in 2005 4065 million in 2004 and 3941 million in 2003 continued to improve grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding net cash provided by operations increased 260 million in 2005 over 2004 driven primarily by increased net earnings the change in operating assets and liabilities – net of business acquisition and joint venture contributions used cash of 571 million in 2005 the use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable which were up due to higher inventory purchases and sales in december these changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases and increases in profit sharing and compensation related accruals driven by an improved 2005 performance the increase in net cash flows from operations from 2003 to 2004 was primarily attributable to increased net earnings and an improvement in working capital management increases in current liabilities and trade accounts payable were partially offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivables 

  

  

  

  

net cash flows used in investing activities were 1630 million 1424 million and 1053 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively capital expenditures for property buildings equipment and capitalized software were 1572 million 1608 million and 805 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below in 2005 grainger also invested 248 million to purchase aw direct which is part of the lab safety segment the results of operations for aw direct have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date of january 14 2005 

  

net cash flows used in financing activities for 2005 2004 and 2003 were 1541 million 2406 million and 979 million respectively grainger’s funding of treasury stock purchases increased 366 million in 2005 as grainger repurchased 2404400 shares compared with 2001000 shares in 2004 treasury stock purchases were 918300 in 2003 as of december 31 2005 approximately 47 million shares of common stock remained available under grainger’s repurchase authorization dividends paid to shareholders were 827 million in 2005 712 million in 2004 and 673 million in 2003 partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds from stock options exercised of 660 million 723 million and 152 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively during 2004 grainger liquidated its crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt with payments totaling 1408 million 

  

working capital 

internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated in addition funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 

  

working capital was 12709 million at december 31 2005 compared with 10923 million at december 31 2004 and 9268 million at december 31 2003 at these dates the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 27 26 and 23 respectively the current ratio increased in 2004 principally due to grainger’s liquidation of the crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt that had been classified in current liabilities in 2004 

  

capital expenditures 

in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table 

  

   

in both 2005 and 2004 grainger’s investments included the market expansion program which is designed to realign branches in several metropolitan markets ongoing sap initiatives an upgrade of the branch communication systems and expenditures related to canadian branch and systems projects as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment capital expenditures in 2003 related to grainger’s investment in its logistics network which was completed in march 2004 spending for information technology upgrades as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 

  

capital expenditures are expected to range between 140 million to 175 million in 2006 and include investments for the ongoing market expansion program information technology and canadian branch programs international expansion as well as other general projects including the normal recurring replacement of equipment grainger expects to fund 2006 capital investments from operating cash flows which grainger believes will remain strong 

  

  

  

  

debt 

grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit at december 31 2005 grainger’s longterm debt rating by standard  poor’s was aa grainger’s available lines of credit as further discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements were 2500 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 and 2654 million at december 31 2003 total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 04 05 and 75 as of the same dates 

  

grainger entered into a twoyear crosscurrency swap on september 25 2002 on september 27 2004 the crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt matured and were liquidated with payments totaling 1408 million see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition certain holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require grainger to redeem these bonds thus a portion are classified as current maturities of longterm debt 

  

commitments and other contractual obligations 

at december 31 2005 grainger’s contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 

   

purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 

  

the commitments and other contractual obligations table does not include 801 million of accrued employmentrelated benefits costs of which 523 million is related to grainger’s postretirement benefits these amounts are excluded because a portion of the projected benefit payments has already been funded by grainger and the timing of future funding requirements is not known see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

see also notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in grainger’s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

  

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

  

note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

postretirement healthcare benefits  postretirement obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

  

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs as of december 31 2005 grainger reduced the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 575 to 550 to reflect the decline in market interest rates grainger estimates that the reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease 2006 pretax earnings by approximately 08 million 

  

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard  poor’s 500 index to develop its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2005 grainger maintained the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 net of tax at 40 based on the historical average of longterm rates of return 

  

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

  

while grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience and new trends and therefore may affect grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future expense 

  

for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

  

insurance reserves grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

  

grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 

  

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts  grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivables the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer 

  

writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 

  

inventory reserves grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger’s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 

  

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger’s results of operations 

income taxes grainger accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” under sfas no 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management’s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions income tax expense reflects grainger’s best estimates and assumptions regarding among other items the level of future taxable income interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 

  

other other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies relating to revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

inflation and changing prices 

inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

  

the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these longlived assets the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 

  

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

  

  

  

  

forwardlooking statements 

this document contains forwardlooking statements under the federal securities laws the forwardlooking statements relate to grainger’s expected future financial results and business plans strategies and objectives and are not historical facts they are often identified by qualifiers such as “will” “could” “should” “might” “may” “would” “tend” “planned” “presumption” “expects” “intends” “is likely” “anticipates” “scheduled” “believes” “positions it” “continue” “estimates” “forecast” “predicting” “projection” “potential” “ assumption” or similar expressions there are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause grainger’s results to differ materially from what is projected 

  

factors that may affect forwardlooking statements include the following higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers increased competitive pricing pressure on grainger’s businesses failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings changes in laws and regulations facilities disruptions or shutdowns disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance 

  

trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions gross domestic product growth rates general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations global and other conflicts employment levels and other factors 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during a portion of 2004 and all of 2003 grainger partially hedged its net canadian dollar investment in acklands with a crosscurrency swap agreement this agreement was terminated in 2004 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for 2005 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 16 million decrease in net income comparatively in 2004 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 09 million decrease in net income a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 19 million increase in net income for 2005 as compared with an increase in net income of 11 million for 2004 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

  

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio during 2005 and 2004 all of its longterm debt was variable rate debt a onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately 01 million for 2005 and 07 million for 2004 a onepercentagepoint decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to income of approximately 01 million and 07 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or longterm debt levels grainger’s level of interest rate risk has been reduced due to the liquidation of the crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt during 2004 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

grainger is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly

grainger has denied or intends to deny the allegations in all of the abovedescribed lawsuits in 2004 lawsuits relating to asbestos andor silica and involving approximately 700 plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to grainger typically based on the lack of product identification if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer in addition grainger believes that a substantial portion of these claims are covered by insurance grainger is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers regarding the scope and amount of coverage while grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on grainger’s consolidated financial position or results of operations

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio during 2004 and 2003 all of its longterm debt was variable rate debt a onepercentagepoint increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately 07 million for 2004 and 09 million for 2003 a corresponding increase in net income for the noted periods would have resulted had the interest rates paid decreased by one percentage point this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or longterm debt levels grainger’s level of interest rate risk has been reduced due to the liquidation of the crosscurrency swap and related commercial paper debt during 2004 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general grainger is the leading broadline supplier of facilities maintenance products in north america grainger reports its operating results in three segments branchbased distribution lab safety and integrated supply grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches field sales forces direct marketing including catalogs and a variety of electronic and internet channels grainger serves customers through a network of 575 branches 17 distribution centers and multiple web sites 

  business environment several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger’s business environment the current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in the development of projections for the upcoming year at the start of 2004 the consensus forecastusa is predicting gdp and industrial production growth of 4 to 5 percent for 2004 grainger’s sales to manufacturers tend to correlate more with employment levels than with manufacturing output so job creation in addition to manufacturing production is an indicator for potential sales growth most recently declining employment in the manufacturing sector due to increased productivity and production moving offshore has adversely affected the operating results of grainger 

this trend is likely to continue and could adversely affect employment levels in one of grainger’s largest sectors to address this trend grainger has been focusing on government and commercial customers and healthcare institutions to reach more customer groups grainger’s market expansion program will increase branch coverage expand local availability of products and add local sales professionals in high potential markets through a multiyear program focused on local customers 

the customer’s buying behavior also affects grainger’s business environment in 2004 grainger will continue to target large multisite customers including government and national accounts sales from government accounts grew from 13 of total sales in 2001 to 17 in 2003 grainger believes that customers will increasingly focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products grainger is addressing this anticipated shift in focus by expanding its market coverage and increasing product information available to branch employees for improved service to local customers by accelerating replacement of its legacy information systems grainger’s financial strength including its low debt and strong cash flow leaves it well positioned to fund initiatives to accelerate top line growth 

 

in 2004 grainger will be investing in the branch network and information technology including the following major items 

    in 2004 total capital expenditures of 200 to 225 million are anticipated more than double that of recent years capital spending for the market expansion program may be affected by decisions to lease rather than purchase the related facilities andor equipment 

  matters affecting comparability the emerging issues task force eitf issued “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” issue 0216 in november 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in january 2003 for more detailed information regarding this change in accounting see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements grainger’s accounting treatment for vendor provided funds was consistent with issue 0216 with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances which had been accounted for as an offset to operating advertising expenses this accounting treatment is only allowable under issue 0216 in certain specific circumstances as a result of issue 0216 grainger will classify the majority of its vendor provided allowances as an offset to cost of merchandise sold rather than operating advertising expenses application of issue 0216 is on a prospective basis as contracts are either modified or renewed since a majority of the 2003 contracts with provisions for advertising allowances were entered into prior to december 31 2002 the amounts classified as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold of 79 million were not material to 2003 this change does not have any effect on net earnings 

grainger’s operating results for 2003 include the operating results of gempler’s a direct marketing division of gempler’s inc from the acquisition date of april 14 2003 gempler’s results are included in the lab safety segment 

effective january 1 2002 grainger adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as a result of the application of the new impairment methodology introduced by sfas no 142 grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings in 2002 of 323 million 239 million aftertax or 026 per diluted share related to the writedown of acklands goodwill see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2002 acklands sales declined as automotive aftermarket parts sales were eliminated due to the creation of the joint venture with uniselect inc in canada see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

results of operations the following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in grainger’s consolidated statements of earnings 

 2003 compared to 2002 grainger’s net sales of 46670 million for 2003 were essentially flat compared to 2002 full year results were affected by the general weakness in the us economy sales in the branchbased distribution business segment increased 192 million over 2002 generally unchanged yearoveryear revenue increased in the lab safety segment while sales for integrated supply declined 

 

despite the limited sales growth experienced during the year gross profit margins improved in 2003 to 351 from 344 principally due to favorable changes in product mix and selected price increases designed to offset increased freight and other costs grainger’s operating earnings of 3873 million in 2003 decreased 15 from the prior year operating margins declined to 83 in 2003 from 85 in 2002 reflecting higher operating expenses yearoveryear the principal driver of the operating expense increase was higher severance and healthcare expenses advertising expenses increased as a result of the classification of 79 million of vendor provided allowances in cost of merchandise sold rather than in operating advertising expenses 

grainger’s net earnings of 2270 million in 2003 increased 154 million or 73 as compared with 2002 net earnings of 2116 million diluted earnings per share for the year increased to 246 in 2003 from 224 in 2002 in 2002 grainger recorded a 239 million aftertax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the results for 2002 also included an aftertax gain of 12 million or 001 per diluted share on the reduction of restructuring reserves established for the shutdown of material logic 

segment analysis the following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

branchbased distribution net sales at the branchbased distribution businesses totaled 41672 million in 2003 and were essentially flat when compared with 2002 sales of 41480 million sales in the united states declined approximately 1 in 2003 as compared with 2002 government account sales were up nearly 11 in 2003 while all other customer segments including light and heavy manufacturing were down when compared with 2002 the declines noted in the other customer segments were primarily due to the weakness in the us economy particularly in manufacturing within these customer segments sales to national accounts increased approximately 2 over 2002 

sales growth through internet channels continued in 2003 increasing 159 over 2002 and representing 126 of segment sales grainger will continue to invest in procurement technology to encourage online purchases by its customers and expects sales growth from internet channels to continue in 2004 

sales in canada increased 154 in 2003 principally due to a favorable exchange rate in local currency sales grew 27 primarily in ontario and national accounts in mexico sales declined 37 in 2003 as compared with 2002 principally due to a weak economy in mexico 

cost of merchandise sold of 26826 million for 2003 in the branchbased distribution businesses was essentially flat compared to 26994 million in 2002 gross profit margins increased 07 percentage points to 356 in 2003 from 349 in 2002 selected price increases designed to offset increased freight and other costs both in the united states and canada combined with a favorable change in product mix contributed to the margin increase the classification of vendor provided allowances from operating advertising expenses to cost of merchandise sold also increased gross profit margin by 02 percentage points 

branchbased distribution operating expenses increased 39 in 2003 primarily due to higher severance and healthcare expenses and increased occupancy costs the classification of vendor provided allowances from operating advertising expenses to cost of merchandise sold also contributed to the increase 

operating earnings of 3902 million in 2003 declined by 47 million or 12 as compared with 2002 the increase in operating expenses yearoveryear more than offset the improvement in gross profit margin 

lab safety net sales at lab safety increased by 187 million to 3055 million in 2003 a 65 increase over 2002 the sales growth was attributable to incremental sales from gempler’s acquired on april 14 2003 excluding the results of gempler’s yearoveryear net sales decreased 20 as a result of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the us economy a major portion of lab safety’s sales are to manufacturers the overall decline in the manufacturing sector was partially offset by increased sales to customers in the forestry and public safety markets 

the gross profit margin of 420 decreased 08 percentage points due to incremental sales of gempler’s products which have lower gross margins than the rest of lab safety’s products in addition in 2003 there was a shift in sales mix to lower margin new product sales 

lab safety operating expenses of 865 million increased 145 in 2003 when compared with 755 million for 2002 the primary driver of the yearoveryear increase was the incremental costs associated with the addition of gempler’s during the year and higher spending on catalog media 

as a result operating earnings of 419 million for lab safety in 2003 declined 111 from operating earnings of 471 million in 2002 

 

integrated supply integrated supply net sales of 2117 million in 2003 were 143 million lower than 2260 million of net sales in 2002 the 63 decrease in net sales resulted from six site disengagements as well as lower volumes from existing customers the decrease in sales was partially offset by incremental sales at seven new customer sites sales include both product sales which are passed through to the customer at cost and management fees 

gross profit declined 19 million in 2003 due to lower management fees operating expenses of 221 million increased 54 in 2003 when compared with 210 million for 2002 the increase of 11 million was principally due to a higher provision for bad debts combined with incremental costs associated with a systems upgrade 

operating earnings of 32 million in 2003 for integrated supply declined 30 million from operating earnings of 62 million in 2002 

other income and expense other income and expense was 62 million of expense in 2003 an unfavorable change of 109 million as compared with 47 million of income in 2002 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense 

 in the fourth quarter of 2003 grainger wrote off its investment in two asian joint ventures resulting in an aftertax charge to earnings of 19 million see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the reduction in gains on sales of fixed assets resulted from the sale of one facility in 2003 versus two in 2002 

income taxes income taxes of 1541 million in 2003 declined 51 as compared with 1623 million in 2002 

grainger’s effective tax rates were 404 and 408 in 2003 and 2002 respectively excluding the effect of the equity losses in unconsolidated entities and the writedown of these investments which did not result in tax benefits the effective income tax rates were 400 for 2003 and 405 for 2002 this change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower nondeductible losses in mexico and a lower tax rate in canada 

2002 compared to 2001 grainger’s net sales of 46439 million for 2002 decreased 23 from net sales of 47543 million in 2001 this decline resulted principally from decreases in the branchbased distribution and lab safety segments and the elimination of the digital segment the decrease was partially offset by an 184 increase at integrated supply the general weakness in the north american economy affected overall sales performance 

grainger’s cost of merchandise sold of 30457 million for 2002 decreased 38 from the cost of merchandise sold of 31650 million for 2001 this decrease was primarily volume related due to the decline in net sales and supply chain efficiencies operating expenses of 12051 million for 2002 decreased 37 from operating expenses of 12507 million for 2001 operating expenses for 2002 included a pretax benefit related to a 19 million reduction of a portion of the material logic shutdown reserve established in 2001 operating expenses for 2001 included a pretax restructuring charge of 391 million related to the shutdown of material logic despite tight expense controls in 2002 grainger was unable to decrease expenses in line with the sales decline grainger’s operating earnings of 3932 million for 2002 increased 161 from operating earnings of 3386 million for 2001 operating earnings were affected by a 19 million benefit and a 391 million expense for 2002 and 2001 respectively related to the restructuring charge established for material logic the results for 2001 included operating losses for the digital segment totaling 102 million 

 

grainger’s net earnings of 2116 million for 2002 increased 212 compared with 2001 net earnings of 1745 million grainger’s diluted earnings per share for the year increased 217 to 224 in 2002 from 184 in 2001 the results for 2002 included an aftertax charge of 239 million 026 per diluted share related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the results for 2002 also included an aftertax gain of 45 million 004 per diluted share from the sales of investment securities and an aftertax gain of 12 million 001 per diluted share related to the reduction of restructuring reserves the results for 2001 included an aftertax charge of 366 million or 039 per diluted share related to the digital businesses described earlier excluding all of these items from both periods and excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle from 2002 results net earnings increased 88 to 2298 million in 2002 from 2112 million in 2001 and earnings per share increased 94 to 244 in 2002 from 223 in 2001 

segment analysis the following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

branchbased distribution net sales at the branchbased distribution businesses amounted to 41480 million in 2002 a 24 decrease as compared with 2001 sales of 42516 million sales in the united states decreased slightly in 2002 as compared with 2001 primarily due to weakness in the north american economy while 2002 sales to government and national accounts increased 13 and 6 respectively when compared with the prior year sales declines in other categories offset those increases the increased sales to government and national accounts were primarily due to sales and marketing programs focused on developing these markets 

sales were favorably affected by continued momentum in grainger’s internet programs for 2002 internet channels processed sales of 4195 million a 26 increase from the 3325 million processed in 2001 grainger continued to focus on converting its customers to purchasing online grainger has experienced incremental revenue across all channels from customers who convert to online purchasing 

in canada sales decreased 126 in 2002 as compared with 2001 this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of automotive aftermarket parts sales as a result of the joint venture with uniselect inc established on february 1 2002 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements excluding the impact of the joint venture sales were down 52 for the year due to the weakness in the natural resources sector and the loss of a few major accounts in mexico sales decreased 50 in 2002 as compared with 2001 this decrease was attributable to the weak economy in mexico partially offset by selected price increases intended to offset the declining value of the peso 

gross profit margins improved due to selected pricing actions in 2002 intended to cover freight and supplier cost increases and to favorable product mix partially offsetting these improvements were an unfavorable change in selling price category mix and higher freight costs related to the logistics project 

operating expenses increased 17 in 2002 versus 2001 operating expenses increased due to higher payroll and benefits expenses partially offset by lower advertising from fewer catalogs being printed and lower bad debt expenses from fewer bankruptcies of large customers 

operating earnings of 3949 million increased 22 in 2002 as compared with 3863 million for 2001 the effect of higher gross profit margins was partially offset by lower sales and an increase in operating expenses 

lab safety net sales at lab safety amounted to 2868 million in 2002 an 117 decrease compared with 2001 sales of 3248 million sales at lab safety included the results of the ben meadows co a company acquired on february 26 2001 the sales decrease was primarily the result of weak sales in the us manufacturing sector 

cost of merchandise sold of 1642 million for 2002 at lab safety decreased by 243 million as compared with 1885 million in 2001 this decrease was primarily volume related due to the sales decline 

lab safety operating expenses declined 97 million in 2002 primarily the result of second quarter 2002 workforce reductions and other cost control measures including lower advertising expenditures 

operating earnings of 471 million at lab safety decreased 78 in 2002 as compared with 511 million for 2001 the decrease in operating earnings was primarily the result of lower sales partially offset by lower operating expenses 

integrated supply net sales at integrated supply amounted to 2260 million in 2002 an 184 increase over 2001 sales of 1908 million sales growth for this business was primarily the result of increased penetration of existing customers and includes both product sales and management fees 

integrated supply had operating income of 62 million in 2002 compared with 04 million in 2001 this improvement in operating performance for 2002 was the result of eliminating or restructuring unprofitable contracts throughout 2001 and productivity gains attained by leveraging the existing cost structure operating income for 2002 also benefited from lower bad debt expense compared with 2001 where provisions were made for losses related to two large customer bankruptcies 

 

digital in april 2001 grainger announced that it would shut down the operations of material logic with the exception of findmro material logic was launched in january 2001 as a utility for large customers to facilitate the purchase of facilities maintenance products over the internet material logic would have allowed large customers to access a single networked catalog containing easily searchable and detailed product information prenegotiated prices and availability information for indirect materials from major distributors in order for material logic to grow it needed broad industry support and funding from other equity participants grainger closed material logic because economic and market conditions made it difficult to find funding partners and the market developed more slowly than anticipated in connection with this announcement grainger took a pretax charge of 391 million in 2001 beginning with the 2001 third quarter the digital segment ceased operations see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements effective june 1 2001 findmro was added to the branchbased distribution segment consequently no results were reported for the digital segment in 2002 but 300 million of net sales were reported in 2001 

other income and expense other income and expense was 47 million of income in 2002 an improvement of 460 million as compared with 413 million of expense in 2001 the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense 

 in april 2001 grainger wrote down its investment in other digital businesses and took a pretax charge of 251 million this included the loss on the divestiture of grainger’s 40 investment in workscom inc workscom grainger acquired its ownership in workscom an unrelated third party on august 1 2000 when grainger’s orderzonecom business unit was combined with workscom of this pretax charge 201 million related to the divestiture of workscom and was reported on the income statement as loss on liquidation of investment in unconsolidated entity additionally a loss of 50 million was included in unclassified–net relating to the writedown to net realizable value of investments in other digital businesses see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes income taxes of 1623 million in 2002 increased 323 as compared with 1228 million in 2001 

grainger’s effective tax rates were 408 and 413 in 2002 and 2001 respectively the rate decrease in 2002 as compared with 2001 was primarily due to a reduction of losses in unconsolidated entities the effective tax rate for 2001 was also higher due to the writedown of investments which did not result in tax benefits partially offsetting these items which increased the 2001 tax rate was the tax effect of the writeoff of investment in unconsolidated entity that had tax benefits disproportionate to the writeoff 

excluding the effect of these items the effective tax rate was 405 for both 2002 and 2001 

cumulative effect of accounting change effective january 1 2002 grainger adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

in the second quarter of 2002 grainger completed the initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under sfas no 142 fair values of reporting units were estimated using a present value method that discounted future cash flows when available and as appropriate comparative market multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows as a result of the application of the impairment methodology introduced by sfas no 142 grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings of 323 million 239 million aftertax or 026 per diluted share related to the writedown of goodwill of its canadian subsidiary acklands previous accounting rules required a comparison of book value to undiscounted cash flows whereas new rules require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows which are lower see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

financial condition grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives capital expenditures and payment of cash dividends 

cash flow net cash flows from operations of 3941 million in 2003 3035 million in 2002 and 5092 million in 2001 continued to improve grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements net cash provided by operations in 2003 increased 906 million over 2002 the change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of 558 million in 2003 primarily from a decrease in inventory partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable the reduced inventory resulted from efficiencies realized from the redesigned logistics network and the decrease in trade accounts payable was due to lower inventory purchases during the fourth quarter the majority of the decrease in net cash flows from operations from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to the 2002 inventory infusion to improve service levels and position the branchbased distribution segment to gain share in an economic recovery 

net cash flows used in investing activities were 1053 million 1058 million and 1141 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively capital expenditures for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software were 805 million 1440 million and 1072 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below grainger also funded 367 million in 2003 to purchase gempler’s and 144 million in 2001 to purchase ben meadows both of which are part of the lab safety segment 

net cash used in financing activities for 2003 2002 and 2001 was 979 million 1581 million and 2871 million respectively grainger’s funding of treasury stock purchases decreased 587 million in 2003 as grainger repurchased 918300 shares in 2003 as compared with 2221500 shares in 2002 treasury stock purchases were 1820000 in 2001 as of december 31 2003 approximately 91 million shares of common stock remained available under grainger’s repurchase authorization dividends paid to shareholders were 673 million in 2003 665 million in 2002 and 654 million in 2001 in 2001 more cash from financing activities was required to pay off a higher level of shortterm debt than in 2002 

working capital internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated in addition funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements business development and systems and other infrastructure improvements 

working capital was 9268 million at december 31 2003 compared with 8987 million at december 31 2002 and 8388 million at december 31 2001 the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 23 25 and 25 respectively at such dates the current ratio decreased slightly in 2003 due to grainger’s crosscurrency swap debt being reclassified from longterm debt to current maturities of longterm debt in 2003 which increased current liabilities at a higher rate than current assets 

capital expenditures in each of the past three years a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property buildings equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table 

 in 2003 grainger continued to invest in the logistics network and information technology upgrades as well as normal recurring replacement of equipment higher capital spending in prior years reflects incremental spending for the logistics network project which began in 2000 

capital expenditures are expected to be 200 to 225 million in 2004 and include investments for branches information technology replacement of the branch phone system and completion of the logistics network the level of investment in branches may be influenced by decisions to lease rather than purchase the related facilities andor equipment grainger believes that cash flows from operations will remain strong and expects to fund the 2004 capital investments from existing working capital 

 

restructuring in 2001 grainger shut down the operations of material logic with the exception of findmro and as a result took a pretax charge of 391 million grainger has charged 359 million against the reserve of which 230 million represented cash payments grainger has also reduced its estimate of expense by 25 million since 2001 as of december 31 2003 06 million of the reserve remains for future severance payments and if not settled early lease payments all expenditures will be finalized in 2004 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and longterm cash requirements in addition to internally generated funds grainger has various sources of financing available including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit at december 31 2003 grainger’s longterm debt was rated aa by standard  poor’s a rating it has held since 1987 grainger’s available lines of credit as further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements were 2654 million 2647 million and 4131 million as of december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 75 72 and 78 as of the same dates 

in september 2002 grainger received net proceeds of 1137 million from the issuance of commercial paper the proceeds were used to repay outstanding longterm debt in the amount of c1804 million the longterm debt that was repaid with the proceeds of the commercial paper issuance had been designated by grainger as a nonderivative hedge of grainger’s net investment in its canadian subsidiary grainger entered into a twoyear crosscurrency swap on september 25 2002 which replaced the canadian dollar longterm debt as a hedge of the net investment in grainger’s canadian subsidiary the counterparty to the financial instrument is an investment grade financial institution grainger does not expect any loss from nonperformance by this counterparty since grainger has the ability to refinance the commercial paper with debt having a longer maturity and its intent is to keep the debt outstanding for the twoyear period of the crosscurrency swap the commercial paper has been classified as longterm debt as of december 31 2003 grainger had not determined if it will renew the crosscurrency swap when it comes due in 2004 as a result this commercial paper debt has been classified as current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2003 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition holders of industrial revenue bonds may require grainger to redeem certain of the bonds such as in response to changes in interest rates 

commitments and other contractual obligations at december 31 2003 grainger’s contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 

  

purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty certain vendor agreements provide for minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product 

the above table does not include 680 million of accrued employmentrelated benefits costs of which 421 million is related to grainger’s postretirement benefits because it is not certain when these liabilities will come due see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

see also notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material exposures to offbalance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchangetraded contracts accounted for at fair value 

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in the financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates the revisions are included in grainger’s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 

accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger’s financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations 

note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

postretirement healthcare benefits  postretirement obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts the assumptions used include among others discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience for example could have a material effect on grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense and could affect its results of operations and financial condition these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 

the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on highquality fixed income debt instruments as of december 31 the measurement date of each year in accordance with sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs on december 31 2003 grainger reduced the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 65 to 60 grainger estimates that the noted reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease 2004 pretax earnings by approximately 14 million 

grainger considers the longterm historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the sp 500 to develop its expected longterm return on plan assets in 2003 grainger increased the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets net of tax at 40 from 54 to 60 based on the improved performance of the postretirement trust funds and the historical average longterm rates of return the increase in the expected return on plan assets in 2003 is not anticipated to have a material affect on 2004 pretax earnings 

grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended in the event the postretirement plan is terminated all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue were the postretirement plan to terminate different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 

 

while grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience and new trends and therefore may affect grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future expense further the benefit obligation and net periodic cost may be significantly affected by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 act enacted in december 2003 the plan may also need to be amended in order to benefit from the act 

for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

insurance reserves grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and selfinsured retentions there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 

grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs it retains control over actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and claim payment patterns grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve level 

the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts  grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including age of the receivable the historical ratio of actual writeoffs to the age of the receivable and publicly available default rates the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry group of customers or a specific customer in 2001 reserves were increased in anticipation of adverse economic conditions the economic downturn that followed did not result in the incremental writeoffs expected and as a result the reserve requirement declined 

writeoffs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends or published default rates historically the allowance established for doubtful accounts has been adequate without requiring material adjustment 

inventory reserves grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger’s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 

grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand market conditions and liquidation values actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger’s results of operations 

historically the reserves established for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory have been adequate without material adjustments 

other other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements policies relating to revenue recognition depreciation intangibles longlived assets income taxes and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board the securities and exchange commission etc possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the predominant use of the lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 

 

the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these longlived assets the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation 

grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles which include improving productivity increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 

forwardlooking statements this document contains forwardlooking statements under the federal securities laws the forwardlooking statements relate to grainger’s expected future financial results and business plans strategies and objectives and are not historical facts they are often identified by qualifiers such as “will” “expects” “intends” “is likely” “when completed” “anticipates” “believes” “positioned to” “continue” “estimates” or similar expressions there are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause grainger’s results to differ materially from what is projected 

factors that may affect forwardlooking statements include the following higher product costs or other expenses a major loss of customers increased competitive pricing pressure on grainger’s businesses failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings changes in laws and regulations facilities disruptions or shutdowns disruptions in transportation services natural and other catastrophes unanticipated weather conditions and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance 

trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions gross domestic product growth rates general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations global and other conflicts job creation and employment levels and other factors 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during 2003 and 2002 grainger partially hedged the net canadian dollar investment in acklands with either borrowings denominated in canadian dollars or with a crosscurrency swap agreement see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for 2003 a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 03 million decrease in net income comparatively a uniform 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a 18 million increase in net income in 2002 a uniform 10 weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a 03 million increase in income for 2003 as compared with a decrease in net income of 23 million for 2002 this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio all of its longterm debt at december 31 2003 is variable rate debt see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the maturity schedule of the debt outstanding as of december 31 2003 a one percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately 09 million for 2003 and 08 million for 2002 a corresponding increase in net income for the noted periods would have resulted had the interest rates paid decreased by one percentage point this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on longterm debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or longterm debt levels 

grainger is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly
