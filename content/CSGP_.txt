industry overview 

the market for real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties forsale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics are instrumental to the success of industry participants there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in commercial and residential real estate and the related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of efforts in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database researchers our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

the apartment rental advertising industry serves property managers and owners who are tasked with finding renters to occupy vacant apartments as well as renters who are searching for their next home property managers have several options at their disposal including their own websites driveby and outdoor advertising traditional classified ads free online listing services search engine marketing and internet listings services “ils” like apartmentscom and the network of apartment listing websites we own and operate many apartment ils websites feature only the rental availabilities that larger property owners pay to advertise resulting in a poor user experience in which the renter’s search criteria return either limited or no results irrelevant results or stale results that do not represent actual availabilities 

we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information our apartment ils websites include renterfocused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria eg commute time to work professional images of the properties including immersive videos and 3d interactive models custom neighborhood profiles and tenant reviews our network of apartment listing websites draws on our multifamily database and includes researched and verified information we proactively gather information on available rentals to improve the accuracy of the listings on our apartment ils websites including real time unitlevel availability current pricing and rent specials we have continually invested in our network to improve the features and services offered to property managers and website users recent additions include dynamic lead forms that provide more information about prospective residents making rent trends information publicly available free digital ad retargeting and integrated online rental solutions including lease applications with tenant credit and background checks we believe that we have created and maintain easily searchable apartment ils websites with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods as well as easy to use and actionable tools for the rental process 

we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive homes for sale information in a platform that allows collaboration between homebuyers and agents our residential websites include homebuyerfocused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria eg home features view and lot type review rankings of nearby schools and tools to educate consumers on the home buying process we plan to develop original media rich content of neighborhoods schools parks and condominium buildings amenities and common areas to supplement information in agent listings we are designing tools to facilitate collaboration between homebuyers and agents 

costar’s comprehensive database 

we have spent more than 30 years building and acquiring databases of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as location site and zoning information building characteristics space and unit availability tax assessments ownership sales and lease comparables space requirements number of retail stores number of listings mortgage and deed information forsale and forlease listings income and expense histories tenant names lease expirations contact information historical trends demographic information and retail sales per square foot the database also includes building photographs aerial photographs 3d virtual tours plat maps and floor plans

our researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information training our clients to use costar group products and handling their customer service questions creating a one touch approach to customer care because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions through our online tool which we refer to as our marketing center or directly to our researchers 

our field research effort includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new availabilities find additional property inventory new construction collect tenant information verify existing information photograph properties and create high quality videos of interior spaces including walkthrough videos and 3d virtual tours amenities and exterior features of properties we utilize hightech field research vehicles primarily within north america and europe a significant majority of these vehicles are customized energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to precisely measure buildings and geocode 

and position them on digital maps each vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection of a commercial property consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “forsale” or “forlease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information field researchers also canvass properties collecting tenant data suitebysuite we also utilize a lowflying airplane and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate we place researchers on the lowflying aircraft to scout additional commercial developments and take aerial photographs and videos our us drone operators are federal aviation administration certified and trained to capture aerial photographs and videos our drone operators in the uk and canada are certified and trained to civil aviation authority and transport canada standards with a permission for commercial operations pending 

we plan to leverage our capabilities developed from our extensive commercial real estate research efforts to produce original media rich content of neighborhoods schools parks and condominium buildings amenities and common areas for our residential products using professional photographers and fleets of drones to conduct aerial research of residential real estate 

data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps aerial photographs and 3d virtual apartment tours of apartment communities all of which enhance various of our services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and online marketplaces 

management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include 

• calling our information sources on recently updated properties to reverify information 

• performing periodic research audits and field checks to determine if we correctly canvassed buildings 

• providing training and retraining to our research professionals to ensure accurate and standardized data compilation and 

• compiling measurable performance metrics for research teams and managers for feedback on data quality 

finally one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day

as markets for information analytics and online marketplaces develop additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter a market and competition may intensify for example a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business we may also enter markets where incumbent players have greater name recognition and resources creating challenges as we work to expand

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplace services our subscriptionbased services generate the largest portion of our revenues our revenue may not grow or could decrease if we cannot attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of current clients customer decisions that they do not need our services or to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems competitive pressures or devaluation of the local currencies of international customers relative to the us dollar which impairs the purchasing power of such customers we compete against many other real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate net new sales and revenues may decline or fail to meet expectations 

we may not be able to successfully develop and introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services that are attractive to our users and advertisers or successfully combine or shift focus from current services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers and to successfully introduce new and upgraded services including services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to advertisers to be successful we must be able to quickly adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies 

developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department product development team management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful in addition launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts additional strain on our sales and marketing resources if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share or in obtaining widespread adoption of new or upgraded services we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the development launch and marketing of the new or upgraded service which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for example to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our marketplaces we have and will continue to invest significant resources in multichannel marketing campaigns if these marketing campaigns do not increase brand awareness site traffic andor revenues the cost of these campaigns could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition as we integrate acquired businesses we continue to assess which services we believe will best meet the needs of our customers if we eliminate or phase out a service and are not able to offer and successfully market and sell an alternative service our revenue may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers our competitors may have greater brand recognition or more direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do which may provide them with competitive advantages to compete successfully for advertisers we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a downturn or consolidation in the real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand reduced real estate demand due to increased remote work policies rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a downturn in the real estate market including as a result of a decline in leasing activity and absorption rates may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our 

current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry may consolidate often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization including field sales personnel if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase we may face additional challenges in hiring employees in an increasingly competitive job market 

our internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins to increase our revenue growth we continue to invest in our business including internal investments in product and content development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and external investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of these investments furthermore our investments may not produce the expected results if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell landsofamerica str tenx homescom and homesnap which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites our homescom and homesnap residential marketplaces costar showcase and the landcom network of rural lands forsale we expect to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in 2022 as we seek to grow the numbers of users of subscribers to and advertisers on our marketplaces our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on our websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if internet search engines do not prominently feature our websites on the search engine results page traffic to our websites would decrease and if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace business depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites google bing duckduckgo and other internet search engines drive traffic to our websites including costarcom the apartmentscom network of rental websites the loopnetcom network of commercial real estate websites tenxcom our homescom and homesnap residential marketplaces the bizbuysellcom network of business forsale websites and the landcom network of land forsale websites for example when a user enters in a search query for an apartment building name or address into an internet search engine the internet search engine’s ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed on the search engine results page our ability to maintain prominent search result rankings and positioning is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization seo and search engine marketing sem efforts may result in webpages from their websites receiving higher rankings than the webpages from our websites internet search engines could revise their algorithms and methodologies in ways that would adversely affect our search result rankings internet search engine providers could form partnerships or enter into other business relationships with our competitors resulting in competitors’ sites receiving higher search result rankings internet search engines are increasingly placing alternative search features such as featured snippets local map results and other immersive experiences on the search engine results page above or more prominently than search engine results if our search result rankings are not prominently displayed traffic to our websites may decline which could slow the growth of our user base our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations will occur in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines or otherwise fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or 

advertisers and deliver leads to and retain existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected as a result our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products 

competition could render our services uncompetitive and reduce our profitability  the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general are highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to ours that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers advertisers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites our residential brands including homescom and homesnap and the landcom network of rural lands forsale depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

• increasing the number of unique visitors to and users of our websites and mobile applications 

• the quantity and quality of the leads that we provide to our advertisers 

• the success of any marketing and product development efforts directed at attracting additional users and advertisers to our marketplaces 

• keeping pace with changes in technology and with our competitors and 

• offering an attractive return on investment to our advertisers for their advertising dollars spent with us 

further with respect to the apartmentscom network of rental websites our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

many of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have longterm contracts these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenues and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance integrate andor manage costs related to acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we are likely to incur costs in connection with proposed acquisitions but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate any particular proposed transaction for various reasons for example in 2021 the ftc withheld approval for our proposed acquisition of rentpath the purchase agreement was subsequently terminated and we incurred a termination fee of 52 million we are also likely to incur severance costs and other integration costs postacquisition costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including risks that we will not be able to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations manage the integration of personnel and products or services manage the integration of acquired infrastructure and controls control potential increases in operating costs manage geographically remote operations maintain management’s attention on other business concerns and avoid potential disruptions in ongoing operations during an acquisition process or integration efforts successfully enter markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience including foreign markets whose practices regulations or laws may pose increased risk and retain key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies for example we may be unable to fully integrate homesnap homescom and bureauxlocaux with costar when and as expected 

we are subject to an ftc consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov that among other things requires us to give the ftc advance notice of certain acquisitions compliance with this order could prevent us from closing certain acquisitions or add significant time and cost to such acquisitions ultimately making an acquisition prohibitive or preventing us from realizing its anticipated benefits 

external factors such as compliance with laws and regulations and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful integration of an acquired business an acquired business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to complete future acquisitions if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain or may be denied as in the case of rentpath if regulatory approval is obtained the terms of any such approval may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business if regulatory approval is denied we may incur significant additional costs payable to an acquisition target as a result of failure to close the transaction for example we incurred a termination fee of 52 million in connection with termination of the rentpath purchase agreement significant breakup fees incurred in the future may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

as a result of our acquisitions we had approximately 28 billion of goodwill and intangibles as of december 31 2021 future acquisitions may increase this amount if we are required to recognize goodwill and intangibles impairment charges in the future this would negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients and vendors we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information such as names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we collect store and use biometric data and sensitive or confidential transaction and account information we also collect personal information from tenants and landlords including social security numbers birthdates and financial information to facilitate the apartment rental application and payment process between a renter and property manager as a result we are subject to a variety of state national and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data including the fair credit reporting act the general data protection regulation gdpr and california consumer privacy act ccpa these laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations for example the gdpr introduced new data protection requirements in the eu and imposes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process the ccpa expands the rights of california residents to access and require deletion of their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation other states have adopted or are considering enacting similar laws any failure or alleged failure to comply with privacy or data protection laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us and 

could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition cash flows and results of operations compliance with any of the foregoing laws and regulations can be costly can delay or impede the development of new products and may require us to change the way we operate 

the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products if so in addition to the possibility of negative publicity fines lawsuits and other claims and penalties we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products which could harm our business 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition as stated above our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data we also collect store and process employee personal data an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to a targets systems data or customers data disable or degrade services or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to or disrupt our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce for example through spear phishing attacks or social engineering our employees customers vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems our efforts to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents may not be effective further the security measures and procedures our customers vendors and other users of our systems have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches cyberattacks or system failures 

our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ or employees’ personal or proprietary information that is stored on or accessible through those systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of our security could result in any of the following among other things any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

• interrupt our operations 

• result in our systems or services being unavailable 

• result in improper disclosures of data 

• result in improper payments 

• materially harm our reputation and brands 

• result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure 

• cause us to incur significant remediation costs 

• lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services 

• divert the attention of management from the operation of our business and 

• result in significant contractual penalties or other payments as a result of thirdparty losses or claims 

in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects on our business for example in december 2020 we became aware that one of our vendors providing it infrastructure management software solarwinds corporation had been compromised by cyberattacks as of december 22 2020 we had implemented the fully patched versions of the solarwinds software and we took additional measures to block internet connectivity to and from all solarwinds orion servers although we have not identified any compromise of our it systems due to the use of solarwinds software to date we continue to monitor our network for any potential impact related to the solarwinds cyberattack similarly we are regularly exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed thirdparty software that we use in the ordinary course of business such as the recently identified log4j vulnerability while this vulnerability did not have a material adverse effect on our operations it and similar incidents require us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis notwithstanding our efforts there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities in widely deployed software will not materially harm our business any breach of our security measures or the loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of 

the solarwinds cyberattack could result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business the coverage under our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks or use of malware could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit users access to our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree we may encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems our users rely on our services for the conduct of their own businesses disruptions in technical problems with or reductions in ability to access our services for any reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or reduce demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

we are planning to undertake a large infrastructure project to build out our campus in richmond virginia the costs of which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in december 2021 we announced our plans to expand our research and technology center in richmond virginia these plans will require significant capital expenditures over the next several years and our business plans may change future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to finance this project additionally actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our projected capital expenditures which could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition if we are provided with any grants tax credits abatements or other incentives related to this expansion effort and do not meet requirements associated with those incentives we may not be able to benefit from those incentives which could cause the cost of the project to be significantly more than anticipated or significantly increase our taxes above what we currently expect we are currently considering financing options and may finance construction with cash on hand use of cash on hand to finance construction would reduce the amount of cash available for other corporate uses and could also reduce our ability to meet our 

scheduled debt service obligations or to meet the covenants required to borrow additional funds under our 2020 credit agreement any of the foregoing may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and increasing the depth of our coverage in existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer or are more expensive than planned or we are not successful in marketing and selling our services in existing or new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to market cyclicality each of which could negatively affect our stock price the real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles seasonality and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the different sectors of the large and fragmented industry such as office industrial retail multifamily single family and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results we generally see higher sales of apartmentscom listing services during the peak summer rental season and higher costar sales towards the end of the year however sales fluctuate from yeartoyear and may fluctuate more widely when there are changes in general economic conditions or the industry such as changes resulting from the covid19 pandemic in addition we generally incur greater marketing expenses during the second quarter which coincides with the peak season for apartment rentals the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slowdowns during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described in this paragraph and below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

• rates of subscriber adoption and retention 

• timing of our sales conference or significant marketing events 

• changes in our pricing strategy and timing of changes 

• the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements 

• the shift of focus from or phase out of services that overlap or are redundant with other services we offer 

• the amount and timing of our expenses and capital expenditures 

• the amount and timing of noncash stockbased charges 

• acquisitionrelated costs or impairment charges associated with such investments and acquisitions 

• competition 

• changes or consolidation in the real estate industry 

• interest rate fluctuations 

• execution of our expansion and integration plans 

• the development of our sales force 

• foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations 

• inflation and 

• changes in client budgets 

these fluctuations could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web product and development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees we experienced an increase in turnover as we returned nearly all our workforce to the office we may face additional challenges in retaining employees in an increasingly competitive job market 

changes in tax laws regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could increase our cost of doing business in addition from time to time us and foreign tax authorities including state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rate for example the us congress has advanced a variety of tax legislation proposals and while the final form of any legislation is uncertain the current proposals if enacted could have a material effect on our effective tax rate 

our business and results of operations have been and may be and our financial condition may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse and continue for an unknown period of time the covid19 pandemic has created significant economic volatility uncertainty and disruption around the world the extent to which covid19 will further impact our business operations and financial results including the duration and magnitude of such impact is uncertain and will depend on numerous rapidly evolving factors that we cannot accurately predict including among others 

• the length and severity of the pandemic including new variants 

• the negative impact on global and regional economies credit markets and economic activity 

• governmental business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity 

• the impact of business disruptions and reductions in employment levels and the level of consumer confidence in the economy on our clients and the resulting impact on their demand for our services and solutions 

• business consolidations or failures among businesses that we serve 

• our clients’ ability to pay for our services and solutions and our ability to collect payment for services provided and 

• the pace and extent of economic recovery following the covid19 pandemic including recovery in the real estate industry in particular 

the demand for office space could decrease significantly as businesses implement hybrid or all work from home arrangements in response to employee desire for more flexibility which may lead to a downturn in the commercial real estate market a depressed commercial real estate market would have a negative impact on our core customer base which could impact our customers’ ability to subscribe and pay for our services and reduce demand for our services reduced demand and increased cancellations could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rates to decline and reduce our profitability as a result of covid19 and its impact on global economic conditions including the real estate industry towards the end of the first quarter and in the first two months of the second quarter of 2020 we saw an increase in customer requests for cancellations or suspensions a reduction in new customer sales failures to pay and delays in payments of amounts owed to us we may see additional requests as current economic conditions cause customers to reduce expenses and prolong the decisionmaking time before purchasing third party services which may lead to fewer of our services being purchased or service cancellations the extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the economy is unknown and there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy will be successful or available to us and our customers and if successful when the benefits will be seen 

covid19 and the disruption in global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors discussed in this report which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks for additional discussion of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic which could be materially adverse to our operations and financial results please see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of the covid19 pandemic in item 7 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards and facilitation of other customer payments  

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems to authorize and process credit card transactions one or more of the major credit card companies could disallow our continued use of their payment products if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems to authorize and process credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions and automated clearing house ach payments both for payments made to us directly for our services and for payments made by renters to landlords using our online leasing services if we or any one or more of these service providers fail to maintain adequate systems for authorization 

and processing credit card payments it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products further if we or any one or more of these service providers fail to maintain adequate systems for authorization and processing of credit debit ach or similar payments or if any such service provider were to terminate or modify its relationship with us unexpectedly our ability to process those customer transactions would be adversely affected which could decrease sales discourage customers away from our marketplace services result in potential legal liability and harm our business and reputation in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards cardholders and transactions 

the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals who are becoming increasingly sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data are compromised due to a breach of data we may be liable for significant costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs if we fail to adequately control fraudulent payment transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and higher costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

risks related to our data intellectual property and listings 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or directly from brokers through the marketing center feature on costar and loopnet or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or be subject to legal claims by our customers either of which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including intellectual property involved in our methodologies databases services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights we find our proprietary content on competitors sites if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant have cost us and could continue to cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which we provide our services the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the u s and 

therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position this risk will increase as we continue to expand our business into new international jurisdictions 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies or copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate and display this data on their websites in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures available to us may be insufficient to stop their operations and the misappropriation of our data any measures that we may take to enforce our rights could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories such as breach of laws related to privacy and data protection we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our marketplace services could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our real estate marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted as the number of listings increases so does the utility of a marketplaces search listing and marketing services we depend substantially on brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers to submit listings to our marketplaces if these parties choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue 

risks related to our international operations 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries including differing laws regarding privacy and data protection difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion sometimes exceeds the profit generated from such expansion which reduces our profitability and may adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position a portion of our business is denominated in foreign currencies we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” on january 31 2020 the uk officially withdrew from the eu beginning a transition period of negotiations between the british government and the eu and other governments on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk announced they had entered into a postbrexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues the impact of brexit the december 2020 postbrexit agreement and the future relationship between the eu and the uk including terms not addressed in the december 2020 agreement remain uncertain such uncertainty could cause political and economic uncertainty in the uk and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results in particular brexit caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in global equity markets currency exchange rates and other asset prices including those related to real property brexit may also lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and compliance with those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly further brexit may lead other eu member countries to consider referendums regarding their eu membership we cannot yet predict the future implications of brexit including whether it could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the impact to us from brexit may affect not only our uk operations but operations in other parts of the eu 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could decrease our flexibility and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 1 billion of senior notes outstanding and an additional approximately 750 million available to be drawn under the 2020 credit agreement there can be no assurance that our future cash flows will be sufficient to make payments of interest or principal on the senior notes or any amounts due and payable under the 2020 credit agreement if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations furthermore we may incur substantial additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness and if we incur additional indebtedness or other liabilities the related risks that we face could intensify 

the 2020 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our domestic subsidiaries to among other things i incur additional indebtedness ii incur liens iii pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments investments or acquisitions iv merge or consolidate with another person and v sell assign lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the 2020 credit agreement requires us to comply with a maintenance covenant that we will not exceed a total net leverage ratio calculated as total consolidated debt net of up to 10 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated ebitda of 450 to 100 the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2020 credit agreement may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

a breach of the covenants under the 2020 credit agreement or the indenture that governs the senior notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration provision applies in the event the holders of the senior notes or our other debt accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness 

our borrowings under the 2020 credit agreement will carry a variable interest rate based on the euro interbank offered rate “euribor” or the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform the uk authority that regulates libor announced that it will not compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after june 2023 the full impact of any transition away from libor remains unclear the 2020 credit agreement allows the company and the administrative agent under the 2020 credit agreement to amend the 2020 credit agreement to replace libor with one or more secured overnight financing rate based rates or another alternative benchmark rate we may not be able to agree 

with the administrative agent on a replacement reference rate that is as favorable as libor which may increase in the cost of our borrowings under the 2020 credit agreement 

our indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures marketing and other general corporate activities limits our ability to borrow additional funds and may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate 

a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs reduce our access to capital or result in the loss of certain covenant suspensions  our debt rating could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes warrant any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing 

in addition the 2020 credit agreement provides that during any period of time in which we maintain a corporate investment grade rating from any two of standard  poor’s rating services fitch ratings inc or moody’s investors services inc such period a “covenant suspension period” certain customary negative and affirmative covenants contained in the 2020 credit agreement are suspended including the covenants restricting affiliate transactions incurrence of indebtedness investments asset sales and restricted payments a lowering of one or both of our investment grade ratings would result in increased compliance costs and would impose certain operating restrictions either of which could be materially adverse to our operations and financial results

for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 our annualized net new bookings of subscriptionbased services on all contracts were approximately 217 million 184 million and 210 million respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscriptionbased contracts or upgrades on all existing subscriptionbased contracts less writedowns and cancellations for the period reported net new bookings is considered a key indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of sales force productivity by us and investors however information regarding net new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time revenue from our subscriptionbased contracts was approximately 93 95 and 96 of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the decline in the percentage of our revenue from subscriptionbased contracts from 2019 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisitions of companies which contained a higher percentage of transactionbased revenue than our legacy businesses 

for the trailing twelve months ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 our contract renewal rates for existing costar group companywide subscriptionbased services for contracts with a term of at least one year were approximately 92 89 and 90 respectively and therefore our cancellation rates for those services for the same periods were approximately 8 11 and 10 respectively our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our reve nue results as a result we believe that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance absent extraordinary circumstances our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline as a result of negative economic conditions consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base revenue from our subscriptionbased contracts with a term of at least one year was approximately 77 80 and 82 of total revenue for the trailing twelve months ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the decline in the percentage of our revenue from subscriptionbased contracts from 2019 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisitions of companies which contained a higher percentage of transactionbased revenue than our legacy businesses as well as increases in our sales of shorter term advertising products 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

while the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve it did not materially affect our consolidated financial statements during 2020 or 2021 we are closely and continually monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business employees customers and communities we continue to monitor the guidelines and mandates provided by governmental and health authorities and plan to continue adapting our business operations when and as deemed appropriate to comply with these guidelines and mandates and to respond to changing circumstances most of our workforce has been fully vaccinated against covid19 and where permitted has returned to the office we have resumed inperson marketing events and some business travel the global workforce has been operating in an extraordinary and mostly digital and remote manner as the world adapted during the covid19 pandemic during this time many working adults moved to different locations and adjusted to a different way of living as we transitioned our employees back to the office we experienced and we expect to continue to experience attrition among our workforce resulting in increased costs continued attrition or the inability to replenish and grow our work force may result in work disruptions in the future overall the increased direct spend related to the covid19 pandemic including office reconfiguration to enable social distancing and employee hiring and retention programs has not been material to date and has had minimal impact on our financial position and operating results 

it is currently unclear how the commercial real estate industry will ultimately be impacted by the covid19 pandemic as businesses formulate and execute plans for employees to return to the office implement hybrid work arrangements – allowing work from the office or home or switch to all work from home if the demand for office space decreases significantly there could be a downturn in the commercial real estate market which may materially adversely affect many of our clients a depressed commercial real estate market would have a negative impact on our core customer base which could impact our customers’ ability to subscribe and pay for our services and reduce demand for our services reduced demand and increased cancellations could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rates to decline and reduce our profitability 

during 2021 excluding our multifamily service offering which is discussed under service offerings above our companywide net new bookings and renewal rates for subscriptionbased services have returned to prepandemic levels in addition we saw improvements in collection trends along with improvements in the economy which led us to reduce our allowance for credit losses previously taken due to the uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic and any resulting economic impacts we will continue to monitor these trends and the effect on our results of operations any anticipated changes in financial performance discussed in this report are based on our current observations and experience and involve estimates and assumptions as the future extent and duration of the effects of the covid19 pandemic remain unclear our estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change and actual results may vary 

the effects of the pandemic have not affected our ability to date to access funding on reasonably similar terms as were available to us prior to march 2020we strengthened our liquidity position through an equity offering of common stock in may 2020 and an offering of senior notes and amendment and restatement of our credit facility in early july 2020 see note 11 and note 15 in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of our equity and senior notes offerings in 2020 and the 2020 credit agreement

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include net income before interest expense income other expense income loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda is our net income before interest expense income other expense income loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense  acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by revenues for the period nongaap net income is determined by adjusting our net income for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs and then subtracting an assumed provision for income taxes nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

we may disclose adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income is net income we believe the most directly comparable gaap financial measures to nongaap net income per diluted share and adjusted ebitda margin are net income per diluted share and net income divided by revenue respectively in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income and net income per diluted share in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and accompanying reconciliations provide additional information to investors that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business without the impact of certain acquisitionrelated items we have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to these acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and loss on debt extinguishment adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year without the impact of these items we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest expense income other expense income income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the diminishing value of any acquired trade names and other intangible assets and the use of our acquired technology which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• the amount of interest expense income and other expense income we generate and incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows and outflows however we do not consider the amount of interest expense income and other expense income to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

• income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business however we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

• the amount of loss on our debt extinguishment may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents losses from the early extinguishment of debt however we do not consider the amount of the loss on debt extinguishment to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from ebitda to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

• stockbased compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives determining the fair value of the stockbased instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stockbased awards therefore we believe it is useful to exclude stockbased compensation in order to better understand the longterm performance of our core business 

• the amount of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because such costs generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to acquisitions because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle we do not consider the amount of acquisition and integrationrelated costs to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

• the amount of settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent gains or losses from the settlement of litigation matters or impairments on acquired intangible assets we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• the amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in a contract or a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel we do not consider the amount of restructuring related costs to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring and related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income in addition to these exclusions from net income we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income we assume a 25 tax rate which approximated our historical longterm statutory corporate tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to investors to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

1 as of september 30 2021 commercial property and land revenue has been further disaggregated into loopnet residential and other marketplaces prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect this presentation 

revenues  revenues increased to 19 billion in 2021 from 17 billion in 2020 the 285 million increase was attributable to increases across all of our primary service offerings led by an 80 million or 13 increase in multifamily revenue the multifamily increase was due to higher sales volume and upgrades of existing customers to higher value advertising packages earlier in 2021 residential revenues were 75 million and were solely comprised of operations from the acquisitions of homesnap and homescom which contributed revenues of 61 million and 14 million respectively costar revenues increased 58 million or 9 primarily due to higher sales volume driven by an increase in subscribers as well as subscribers upgrading their subscriptions and the resumption of annual price increases for contract renewals that began in september 2021 other marketplaces revenue increased 33 million or 38 primarily driven by tenx which had an increase of 26 million due to two additional quarters of revenue compared to the prior year loopnet revenues increased 28 million or 15 as a result of stronger site traffic which drove an increase in the price per advertisement as compared to the prior year information services revenue increased 12 million or 9 primarily due to increases of 6 million and 4 million in revenue for our costar real estate manager and str service offerings respectively 

gross profit  gross profit increased to 16 billion in 2021 from 14 billion in 2020 the gross profit percentage was 82 for 2021 compared to 81 for 2020 the increase in gross profit was due to higher revenues partially impacted by an increase in cost of revenues of 48 million or 16 primarily due to an increase of 48 million due to the acquisitions of homesnap homescom and tenx these additional costs primarily consisted of personnel and data costs and to a lesser extent amortization software and equipment costs and bank and merchant fees 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses increased to 622 million in 2021 from 536 million in 2020 the 86 million increase was attributable to a 46 million increase in marketing expenses primarily driven by a 32 million increase in marketing agency spending primarily for loopnet and tenx and to a lesser extent increases in events digital and other forms of marketing partially offset by decreases in multifamily agency spending and search engine marketing there was also a 34 million increase in personnel costs primarily attributable to the acquisitions of homesnap homescom and tenx and to a lesser extent an increase in commissions expense for other products of 7 million partially offset by a 4 million decrease in bonus expense 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased to 201 million in 2021 from 163 million in 2020 and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at 10 in 2021 and 2020 the 38 million increase in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to a 33 million increase in personnel costs driven by the acquisitions of homesnap homescom and tenx as well as increased headcount to support the development of our products and to a lesser extent a 3 million increase in software equipment expense 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses decreased to 257 million in 2021 from 300 million in 2020 and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 13 in 2021 from 18 in 2020 the 43 million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the 52 million break fee and 8 million in extension payments that were recognized in the prior year in connection with the asset purchase agreement with rentpath which was terminated in december 2020 in addition there was a 14 million decrease in credit loss expense due to better than expected collections resulting in updated assumptions regarding credit losses and a decrease in reserves previously increased due to uncertainty about the economic effects of covid19 pandemic these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 13 million in general and administrative expenses due to the acquisitions of homesnap homescom and tenx as well as increases of 6 million in software and equipment expense 3 million in personnel costs 2 million each in depreciation professional services occupancy and travel costs 

customer base amortization expense customer base amortization expense increased to 75 million in 2021 from 62 million in 2020 and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at 4 in 2021 and 2020 the increase in customer base amortization expense was primarily due to the acquisitions of homesnap homescom and tenx 

interest expense net interest expense net was 32 million in 2021 as compared to interest expense net of 17 million in 2020 the increase of 14 million in 2021 was primarily due to interest expense of 28 million recognized during 2021 on our senior notes issued on july 1 2020 as compared to 14 million in 2020 in addition there was a decrease of 4 million in interest income caused by lower rates of return on our cash and cash equivalent balances compared to the prior year partially offset by interest earned on higher average cash balances these changes were partially offset by prior year interest expense of 5 million incurred on the 745 million draw on our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2020 

other income expense net other income expense net was a net income of 3 million in 2021 as compared to net expense of 1 million in 2020 the increase in other income was due to rental income on the richmond building which was acquired in 2021 and to a lesser extent increases in foreign exchange gains due to rate fluctuations 

income tax expense income tax expense increased to 111 million in 2021 from 44 million in 2020 as a result of higher income before taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate for 2021 to 28 compared to 16 in 2020 the increase in the effective tax rate was due to a tax restructuring gain as well as a decrease in excess tax benefits these increases were partially offset by a reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions previously recognized 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 24 2021 

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2021 and year ended december 31 2020 

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with the primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being north america which includes the us and canada and international which primarily includes europe asiapacific and latin america management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda which is our net income before interest expense income and other expense income loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of the business however this 

measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  north america revenues increased to 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 from 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 the 276 million increase in north america revenues was attributable to increases in revenues for several of our services multifamily revenues increased 80 million due to higher sales volume and upgrades of existing customers to higher value advertising packages earlier in 2021 residential revenues increased 75 million due to the acquisitions of homesnap and homescom which contributed revenues of 61 million and 14 million respectively costar revenues increased 53 million primarily due to higher sales volume driven by an increase in customers as well as customers upgrading their subscriptions and the resumption of annual price increases for contract renewals that began in september 2021 other marketplaces revenue increased 33 million primarily driven by tenx which had an increase of 26 million due to two additional quarters of revenue compared to the prior year loopnet revenues increased 25 million as a result of stronger site traffic which drove an increase in the price per advertisement as compared to the prior year information services revenue increased 10 million due to increases of 6 million and 2 million in revenue for our costar real estate manager and str service offerings respectively international revenues increased to 67 million in 2021 from 57 million in 2020 the 10 million increase in international revenues was driven by growth in costar and str which were partially due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent increases in loopnet products including the acquisition of bureauxlocaux 

segment ebitda north america ebitda increased to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 411 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in north america ebitda was primarily due to an increase in revenue partially offset by increases in personnel marketing and general and administrative costs international ebitda increased to income of 8 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from a loss of 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was due to increased revenue and lower general and administrative costs partially offset by increases in personnel and marketing costs 

for a comparison of our business segment results of operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 24 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe the balance of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash which was 38 billion as of december 31 2021 along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy the companys cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond the company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

debt as of december 31 2021 the company had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of 2800 senior notes due july 15 2030 future interest payments associated with the senior notes are 252 million with 28 million payable within 12 months 

leases the company has lease arrangements for office facilities data centers and certain vehicles as of december 31 2021 the company had fixed lease payment obligations of 134 million with 30 million payable within 12 months 

purchase obligations the company’s purchase obligations are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction and have an original term greater than one year the services acquired under these agreements primarily relate to web hosting third party data or listings and software subscriptions as of december 31 2021 the company had purchase obligations of 95 million with 40 million payable within 12 months 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we expect to continue to make acquisitions 

we currently plan to expand our richmond virginia campus which may result in a material cash requirement in 2022 and beyond we continue to assess financing options for the project 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 71 million to 38 billion primarily due to cash generated from operations of 470 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan of 18 million partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of 193 million purchases of property and equipment and other intangibles of 189 million including 123 million for the purchase of an office building and the underlying land located in richmond virginia and corporate aircraft for 40 million as well as 33 million of repurchases of common stock from employees to satisfy the employees minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock grants 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 470 million compared to 486 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the 16 million decrease was due to a decrease in working capital of 141 million driven by payment of the 52 million termination fee pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with rentpath in the first quarter of 2021 partially offset by an increase in net income excluding certain noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes we expect to increase our investment in residential products in 2022 by approximately 200 million which is expected to reduce our cash flow from operations for the year ended december 31 2022 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 381 million compared to 464 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the 83 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 233 million partially offset by an increase in purchases of property equipment and other assets which included 123 million for the purchase of an office building and the underlying land located in richmond virginia and corporate aircraft for 40 million and proceeds from the sale of our ars investments of 10 million received during 2020 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 157 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 27 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 this decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to proceeds from our may 2020 equity offering net of transaction costs of 17 billion as well as proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes net of transaction costs of 983 million during 2020 

as permitted under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act we deferred payroll taxes due in 2020 all amounts deferred were paid during the year ended december 31 2021 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

• longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

• income taxes 

• revenue recognition and 

• business combinations 

with respect to our accounting policy for longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill we further supplement in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k with the following 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

• significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 

• significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 

• significant negative industry or economic trends or 

• significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination and is calculated as the excess of purchase consideration paid in a business combination over the fair value of assets of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually by each reporting unit or more frequently if an event or other circumstance indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or we elect to bypass such assessment we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies and determined by management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 

as of october 1 2021 we performed an assessment of the relevant qualitative factors for our north america and international reporting units and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its respective carrying amounts there have been no events or changes in circumstances as a result of our qualitative impairment analysis on october 1 2021 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we provide information analytics and online marketplace services to commercial real estate and related business communities within the regions where we operate which primarily include north america europe asiapacific and latin america the functional currency for a majority of our operations is the local currency with the exception of certain international locations for which the functional currency is the british pound 

fluctuations in the british pound canadian dollar and euro may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 revenues denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 4 and 5 respectively of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 our revenues would have decreased by approximately 7 million and 8 million respectively if the us dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 10 for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 our revenues would have increased by approximately 7 million and 8 million respectively if the us dollar exchange rate used weakened by 10 fluctuations in the exchange rates of revenues denominated in any other foreign currencies would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results in addition we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all as of december 31 2021 accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 58 million 

we do not believe we have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 we had 38 billion of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents we currently diversify our cash and cash equivalents holdings amongst multiple financial institutions 

we are subject to interest rate market risk in connection with our new revolving credit facility on july 1 2020 we entered into the 2020 credit agreement which provides for variable rate borrowings of up to 750 million on july 1 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 2800 senior notes due july 15 2030 changes in interest rates would not have a material impact to our current interest and debt financing expense as all of our borrowings except for our credit facility are fixed rate and no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2021 see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k regarding our 2020 credit agreement 

we had approximately 28 billion of goodwill and intangible assets as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable however changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

industry overview 

the market for real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties forsale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics are instrumental to the success of industry participants there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in commercial and residential real estate and the related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of efforts in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database researchers our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

the apartment rental advertising industry serves property managers and owners who are tasked with finding renters to occupy vacant apartments as well as renters who are searching for their next home property managers have several options at their disposal including their own websites driveby and outdoor advertising traditional classified ads free online listing services search engine marketing and internet listings services “ils” like apartmentscom and the network of apartment listing websites we own and operate many apartment ils websites feature only the rental availabilities that larger property owners pay to advertise resulting in a poor user experience in which the renter’s search criteria return either limited or no results irrelevant results or stale results that do not represent actual availabilities 

we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information our apartment ils websites include renterfocused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria eg commute time to work professional images of the properties including immersive videos and 3d interactive models custom neighborhood profiles and tenant reviews our network of apartment listing websites draws on our multifamily database and includes researched and verified information we proactively gather information on available rentals to improve the accuracy of the listings on our apartment ils websites including real time unitlevel availability current pricing and rent specials we have continually invested in our network to improve the features and services offered to property managers and website users recent additions include dynamic lead forms that provide more information about prospective residents a reporting suite that provides customers with rent comparables making rent trends information publicly available and free digital ad retargeting and integrated online rental solutions including lease applications and tenant credit and background checks we believe that we have created and maintain easily searchable apartment ils websites with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods as well as easy to use and actionable tools for the rental process 

costar’s comprehensive database

costar research 

research department our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through phone calls emails and internet updates in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and thirdparty data feeds we have also set up direct feeds from larger apartment sites and have put in place an automated system that compiles information sourced from the internet in order to provide the most uptodate information on rental availabilities

competition 

the market for information analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and extremely dynamic in the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are 

• quality and depth of the underlying databases 

• quality and quantity of leads and leases delivered 

• ease of use flexibility and functionality of the software 

• intuitiveness and appeal of the user interface 

• timeliness of the data including listings 

• breadth of geographic coverage and services offered

• client service and support 

• perception that the service offered is the industry standard 

• price 

• effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts 

• proprietary nature of methodologies databases and technical resources 

• vendor reputation 

• brand loyalty among customers and 

• capital resources 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

• online marketing services websites or data exchanges targeted to commercial real estate brokers buyers and sellers of commercial real estate properties insurance companies mortgage brokers and lenders such as reed business information limited and its estates gazette and radius data exchange products squarefoot officespacecom brevitas catylist now a part of moodys 42floors altus group commercial property search digsy quantum listing realnex marketplace tenantwise rofo buildingsearchcom cimls compstak rightmove yardi propertyshark and commercialcafe crexi totalcommercialcom debtx real capital markets and vts 

• publishers and distributors of information analytics and marketing services including regional providers and national print publications such as cbre economic advisors marshall  swift reis network part of the moodys analytics accelerator real capital analytics real capital markets reonomy yardi matrix realpage and its axiometrics business altus insight and altus realnet canada

• real estate lease management and administration software solutions such as accruent tririga manhattan software tango analytics lease accelerator visual lease sequnetra lease harbor and amt direct 

• inhouse research departments operated by commercial real estate brokers and 

• public record providers 

as the market for information analytics and online marketplaces develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplace services our subscriptionbased services generate the largest portion of our revenues our revenue may not grow or could decrease if we cannot attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of current clients customer decisions that they do not need our services or to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems competitive pressures or devaluation of the local currencies of international customers relative to the us dollar which impairs the purchasing power of such customers we compete against many other real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate net new sales and revenues may decline or fail to meet expectations 

we may not be able to successfully develop and introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services that are attractive to our users and advertisers or successfully combine or shift focus from current services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers and to successfully introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace including services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to advertisers to be successful we must be able to quickly adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies 

developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department product development team management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful in addition launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts additional strain on our sales and marketing resources if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share or in obtaining widespread adoption of new or upgraded services we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the development launch and marketing of the new or upgraded service which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for example to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our apartmentscom network of rental websites we invest significant resources in a multichannel marketing campaign if the marketing campaign does not continue to increase brand awareness site traffic andor revenues the cost of the campaign could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition as we integrate acquired businesses we continue to assess which services we believe will best meet the needs of our customers if we eliminate or phase out a service and are not able to offer and successfully market and sell an alternative service our revenue may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers our competitors may have greater brand recognition or more direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do which may provide them with competitive advantages to compete successfully for advertisers we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business and results of operations have been and will be and our financial condition may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse and continue for an unknown period of time the global spread of covid19 has created significant economic volatility uncertainty and disruption around the world the extent to which covid19 will further impact our business operations and financial results including the duration and magnitude of such impact is uncertain and will depend on numerous rapidly evolving factors that we cannot accurately predict including among others 

• the length and severity of the pandemic 

• the availability of vaccines to our employees and clients 

• the negative impact on global and regional economies credit markets and economic activity 

• governmental business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity 

• the impact of business disruptions and reductions in employment levels and the level of consumer confidence in the economy on our clients and the resulting impact on their demand for our services and solutions 

• business consolidations or failures among businesses that we serve 

• our clients’ ability to pay for our services and solutions and our ability to collect payment for services provided 

• our ability to market develop provide and train clients on the use of our services and solutions including as a result of our employees or our clients’ employees working remotely worker absenteeism or decreased productivity quarantines social distancing or other travel or healthrelated restrictions 

• the pace and extent of economic recovery following the covid19 pandemic including recovery in the real estate industry in particular 

• increased costs of additional safety procedures and increased technologyrelated expenses to provide for business continuity and 

• increased cyber security risk data accessibility concerns and susceptibility to communication disruptions because our employees and employees of our clients are working remotely 

as a result of covid19 and its impact on global economic conditions including the real estate industry towards the end of the first quarter and in the first two months of the second quarter of 2020 we saw an increase in customer requests for cancellations or suspensions a reduction in new customer sales failures to pay and delays in payments of amounts owed to us we may see additional requests as current economic conditions cause customers to reduce expenses and prolong the decisionmaking time before purchasing third party services which may lead to fewer of our services being purchased or service cancellations the extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the economy is unknown and there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy will be successful or available to us and our customers and if successful when the benefits will be seen we expect that cancellations or suspensions reductions of services and failures to pay amounts due to us may increase at any time while the economic impact of the pandemic and the response to the pandemic impacts our customer base we compete against many other real estate information and marketing service providers for business if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues will decline and our profitability will be adversely affected 

as a business we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including increased costs as we have and continue to pivot our employees’ work locations and hours as deemed necessary to respond to covid19 to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and community any actual or perceived failure to comply with government orders rules laws or regulations as a result of changes in our operations in response to covid19 could subject us to investigations claims fines and other penalties which in turn could adversely affect our business 

covid19 and the disruption in global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors discussed in this report which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks for additional discussion of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic which could be materially adverse to our operations and financial results please see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of the covid19 pandemic in item 7 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

a downturn or consolidation in the real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a downturn in the real estate market including as a result of a decline in leasing activity and absorption rates may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry may consolidate often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the 

number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization including field sales personnel if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell landsofamerica str tenx and homesnap which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase and the landcom network of rural lands forsale we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing in 2021 as we seek to grow the numbers of subscribers to and advertisers on our marketplaces our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on our websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins to increase our revenue growth we continue to invest in our business including internal investments in product development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and external investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of these investments furthermore our investments may not produce the expected results if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if internet search engines do not prominently feature our websites on the search engine results page traffic to our websites would decrease and if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace business depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites google bing duckduckgo and other internet search engines drive traffic to our websites including costarcom the apartmentscom network of rental websites the loopnetcom network of commercial real estate websites tenxcom the bizbuysellcom network of business forsale websites and the landcom network of land forsale websites for example when a user enters in a search query for an apartment building name or address into an internet search engine the internet search engine’s ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed on the search engine results page our ability to maintain prominent search result rankings and positioning is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization seo and search engine marketing sem efforts may result in webpages from their websites receiving higher rankings than the webpages from our websites internet search engines could revise their algorithms and methodologies in ways that would adversely affect our search result rankings internet search engine providers could form partnerships or enter into other business relationships with our competitors resulting in competitors’ sites receiving higher search result rankings internet search engines are increasingly placing alternative search features such as featured snippets local map results and other immersive experiences on the search engine results page above or more prominently than search engine results if our search result rankings are not prominently displayed traffic to our websites may decline which could slow the growth of our user base our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations will occur in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines or otherwise fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to and retain existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected as a result our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products 

competition could render our services uncompetitive and reduce our profitability  the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general are highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to ours that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers advertisers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites and the landcom network of rural lands forsale depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

• increasing the number of unique visitors to and users of our websites and mobile applications 

• the quantity and quality of the leads that we provide to our advertisers 

• the success of any marketing and product development efforts directed at attracting additional users and advertisers to our marketplaces 

• keeping pace with changes in technology and with our competitors and 

• offering an attractive return on investment to our advertisers for their advertising dollars spent with us 

further with respect to the apartmentscom network of rental websites our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

many of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have longterm contracts these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenues and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance integrate andor manage costs related to acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we are likely to incur costs in connection with proposed acquisitions but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate any particular proposed transaction for various reasons for example the ftc recently withheld approval for our proposed acquisition of rentpath the purchase agreement was subsequently terminated and we incurred a termination fee of 52 million we are also likely to incur severance costs and other integration costs postacquisition costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including risks that we will not be able to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations manage the integration of personnel and products or services manage the integration of acquired infrastructure and controls control potential increases in operating costs manage geographically remote operations maintain management’s attention on other business concerns and avoid potential disruptions in ongoing operations during an acquisition process or integration efforts successfully enter markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience including foreign markets whose practices regulations or laws may pose increased risk and retain key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies for example we may be unable to fully integrate str tenx and homesnap with costar when and as expected 

we are subject to an ftc consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov that among other things requires us to give the ftc advance notice of certain acquisitions compliance with this order could prevent us from closing certain acquisitions or add significant time and cost to such acquisitions ultimately making an acquisition prohibitive or preventing us from realizing its anticipated benefits 

external factors such as compliance with laws and regulations and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful integration of an acquired business an acquired business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to complete future acquisitions if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain or may be denied as in the case of rentpath if regulatory approval is obtained the terms of any such approval may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business if regulatory approval is denied we may incur significant additional costs payable to an acquisition target as a result of failure to close the transaction for example we incurred a termination fee of 52 million in connection with termination of the rentpath purchase agreement significant breakup fees incurred in the future may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

as a result of our acquisitions we had approximately 27 billion of goodwill and intangibles as of december 31 2020 future acquisitions may increase this amount if we are required to recognize goodwill and intangibles impairment charges in the future this would negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients and vendors we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information such as names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we collect store and use biometric data and sensitive or confidential transaction and account information we also collect personal information from tenants and landlords including social security numbers birthdates and financial information to facilitate the apartment rental application and payment process between a renter and property manager as a result we are subject to a variety of state national and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data including the fair credit reporting act the general data protection regulation gdpr and california consumer privacy act ccpa these laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations for example the gdpr introduced new data protection requirements in the eu and imposes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process following the end of the brexit transition on december 31 2020 the eu and uk agreed as part of a wider trade deal a further transitional period at least another four months extendable to six months during which personal data may flow freely from the european economic area the “eea” to the uk during that period the european commission is considering whether to make an “adequacy decision” in favor of the uk finding that the uk offers protection of personal data equivalent to the eea which will allow data to continue to flow freely between the eea and the uk on february 19 2021 the european commission published draft adequacy decisions if no final adequacy decision is made in favor of the uk before the end of the further transitional period because transfers of personal data between an eea country and the uk will be transfers to a “third country” we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms in place to enable transfers of data from eea countries to the uk to ensure compliance with the gdpr the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 expands the rights of california residents to access and require deletion of their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation any failure or alleged failure to comply with the rules arising from the gdpr and related national laws of eu member states or the uk ccpa and other privacy or data protection laws adopted by other jurisdictions could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us and could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition cash flows and results of operations compliance with any of the foregoing laws and regulations can be costly can delay or impede the development of new products and may require us to change the way we operate 

the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products if so in addition to the possibility of negative publicity fines lawsuits and other claims and penalties we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products which could harm our business 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition as stated above our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data we also collect store and process employee personal data an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to a targets systems data or customers data disable or degrade services or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce for example through spear phishing attacks or social engineering our employees customers vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems our efforts to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents may not be effective further the security measures and procedures our customers vendors and other users of our systems have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches cyberattacks or system failures 

our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ or employees’ personal or proprietary information that is stored on or accessible through those systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of our security could result in any of the following among other things any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

• interrupt our operations 

• result in our systems or services being unavailable 

• result in improper disclosures of data 

• materially harm our reputation and brands 

• result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure 

• cause us to incur significant remediation costs 

• lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services 

• divert the attention of management from the operation of our business and 

• result in significant contractual penalties or other payments as a result of thirdparty losses or claims 

in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects on our business for example in december 2020 we became aware that one of our vendors providing it infrastructure management software solarwinds corporation had been compromised by cyberattacks as of december 22 2020 we had implemented the fully patched versions of the solarwinds software and we took additional measures to block internet connectivity to and from all solarwinds orion servers although we have not identified any compromise of our it systems due to the use of solarwinds software to date we continue to monitor our network for any potential impact related to the solarwinds cyberattack any breach of our security measures or the loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of the solarwinds cyberattack could result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business the coverage under our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit users access to our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree we may encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems our users rely on our services for the conduct of their own businesses disruptions in technical problems with or reductions in ability to access our services for any reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or reduce demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and increasing the depth of our coverage in existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer or are more expensive than planned or we are not successful in marketing and selling our services in existing or new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to market cyclicality each of which could negatively affect our stock price the real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles seasonality and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the different sectors of the large and fragmented industry such as office industrial retail multifamily single family and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results we generally see higher sales of apartmentscom listing services during the peak summer rental season and higher costar suite sales towards the end of the year however sales fluctuate from yeartoyear and may fluctuate more widely when there are changes in general economic conditions or the industry such as changes resulting from the covid19 

pandemic in addition we generally incur greater marketing expenses during the second quarter which coincides with the peak season for apartment rentals the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slowdowns during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described in this paragraph and below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

• rates of subscriber adoption and retention 

• timing of our sales conference or significant marketing events 

• changes in our pricing strategy and timing of changes 

• the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements 

• the shift of focus from or phase out of services that overlap or are redundant with other services we offer 

• the amount and timing of our expenses and capital expenditures 

• the amount and timing of noncash stockbased charges 

• acquisitionrelated costs or impairment charges associated with such investments and acquisitions 

• competition 

• changes or consolidation in the real estate industry 

• interest rate fluctuations 

• execution of our expansion and integration plans 

• the development of our sales force 

• foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations 

• inflation and 

• changes in client budgets 

these fluctuations could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position a portion of our business is denominated in foreign currencies we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web product and development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

changes in tax laws regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could increase our cost of doing business for example in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act and various provisions of the new law may adversely affect us certain aspects of tax reform are unclear and may not be clarified for some time during 2018 the department of the treasury issued certain guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations with respect to several provisions of the new legislation we expect that additional regulations or other guidance may be issued with respect to the tax act in subsequent years we continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business in addition if federal state local or 

foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or issue new guidance including in response to the tax act our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards and facilitation of other customer payments  

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems to authorize and process credit card transactions one or more of the major credit card companies could disallow our continued use of their payment products if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems to authorize and process credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions and automated clearing house ach payments both for payments made to us directly for our services and for payments made by renters to landlords using our online leasing services if we or any one or more of these service providers fail to maintain adequate systems for authorization and processing credit card payments it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products further if we or any one or more of these service providers fail to maintain adequate systems for authorization and processing of credit debit ach or similar payments or if any such service provider were to terminate or modify its relationship with us unexpectedly our ability to process those customer transactions would be adversely affected which could decrease sales discourage customers away from our marketplace services result in potential legal liability and harm our business and reputation in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards cardholders and transactions 

the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals who are becoming increasingly sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data are compromised due to a breach of data we may be liable for significant costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs if we fail to adequately control fraudulent payment transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and higher costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

risks related to our data intellectual property and listings 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or directly from brokers through the marketing center feature on costar and loopnet or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or be subject to legal claims by our customers either of which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including intellectual property involved in our methodologies databases services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights we find our proprietary content on competitors sites if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant have cost us and could continue to cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which we provide our services the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position this risk will increase as we continue to expand our business into new international jurisdictions

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories such as breach of laws related to privacy and data protection we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our marketplace services could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our real estate marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted as the number of listings increases so does the utility of a marketplaces search listing and marketing services we depend substantially on brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers to submit listings to our marketplaces if these parties choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including the bizbuysellcom network of business forsale websites are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

risks related to our international operations 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries including differing laws regarding privacy and data protection difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general 

managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion sometimes exceeds the profit generated from such expansion which reduces our profitability and may adversely affect our financial position 

the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” on january 31 2020 the uk officially withdrew from the eu beginning a transition period of negotiations between the british government and the eu and other governments on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk announced they had entered into a postbrexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues the impact of brexit the december 2020 postbrexit agreement and the future relationship between the eu and the uk including terms not addressed in the december 2020 agreement remain uncertain such uncertainty could cause political and economic uncertainty in the uk and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results in particular brexit caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in global equity markets currency exchange rates and other asset prices including those related to real property brexit may also lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and compliance with those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly further brexit may lead other eu member countries to consider referendums regarding their eu membership we cannot yet predict the future implications of brexit including whether it could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the impact to us from brexit may affect not only our uk operations but operations in other parts of the eu 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could decrease our flexibility and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 1 billion of senior notes outstanding and an additional approximately 750 million available to be drawn under the 2020 credit agreement there can be no assurance that our future cash flows will be sufficient to make payments of interest or principal on the senior notes or any amounts due and payable under the 2020 credit agreement if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations furthermore we may incur substantial additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness and if we incur additional indebtedness or other liabilities the related risks that we face could intensify 

the 2020 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our domestic subsidiaries to among other things i incur additional indebtedness ii incur liens iii pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments investments or acquisitions iv merge or consolidate with another person and v sell assign lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the 2020 credit agreement requires us to comply with a maintenance covenant that we will not exceed a total net leverage ratio calculated as total consolidated debt net of up to 10 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated ebitda of 450 to 100 the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2020 credit agreement may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

a breach of the covenants under the 2020 credit agreement or the indenture that governs the senior notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration provision applies in the event the holders of the senior notes or our other debt accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness 

our borrowings under the 2020 credit agreement will carry a variable interest rate based on the euro interbank offered rate “euribor” or the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform the uk authority that regulates libor announced that it will not compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after june 

2023 the full impact of any transition away from libor remains unclear we may need or seek to negotiate with our lenders for an alternative rate we may not be able to agree with our lenders on a replacement reference rate that is as favorable as libor which may increase in the cost of our borrowings under the 2020 credit agreement 

our indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures marketing and other general corporate activities limits our ability to borrow additional funds and may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate 

a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs reduce our access to capital or result in the loss of certain covenant suspensions  our debt rating could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes warrant any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing 

in addition the 2020 credit agreement provides that during any period of time in which we maintain a corporate investment grade rating from any two of standard  poor’s rating services fitch ratings inc or moody’s investors services inc such period a “covenant suspension period” certain customary negative and affirmative covenants contained in the 2020 credit agreement are suspended including the covenants restricting affiliate transactions incurrence of indebtedness investments asset sales and restricted payments a lowering of one or both of our investment grade ratings would result in increased compliance costs and would impose certain operating restrictions either of which could be materially adverse to our operations and financial results

information services  we provide real estate and lease management technology solutions including lease administration lease accounting and abstraction services through our costar real estate manager® service offerings as well as portfolio and debt analysis management and reporting capabilities through our costar investment analysis and costar risk analytics® service offerings on october 22 2019 we acquired str and we now also provide str’s complementary benchmarking and analytics services to the hospitality industry str sells the majority of its services on a subscription basis but also receives onetime or ad hoc transaction fee re venues we provide information services internationally through our grecam belbex and thomas daily businesses in france spain and germany respectively the growth rates of information services increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the str acquisition the hospitality industry has been severely impacted by covid19 as a result revenue for str declined in the second quarter of 2020 and increased moderately during the remainder of the year we anticipate str revenue and overall information services growth rates to moderate during 2021 

online marketplaces 

multifamily  apartmentscom tm is part of our network of apartment marketing sites which primarily includes apartmentfinder® forrentcom® apartmenthomelivingcom tm  apartamentoscom tm  westside rentals and off campus partners llc ocp our network of subscriptionbased advertising services provides property management companies and landlords with a comprehensive advertising destination for their available rental units and offers renters a platform for searching for available rentals during 2020 multifamily revenue growth rates generally continued to increase relative to 2019 revenue growth rates as tenants property owners and landlords continued to transact in our digital environment

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

a novel strain of coronavirus known as covid19 was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas the full impact of the covid19 pandemic is unknown and is evolving as the pandemic continues the covid19 pandemic did not materially affect our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 

we are closely and continually monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business employees customers and communities to protect the health and safety of our employees and to help stop the spread of the disease we shifted to a digital remote workplace in midmarch 2020 as of that time nearly all of our employees began to work from home and continue to do so as of the date of this filing we have temporarily shifted certain employees’ job responsibilities so they can work from home and modified our inperson research and sales processes so that they can be conducted safely and in compliance with social distancing guidelines to protect our employees our customers and our communities we believe our employees are operating at near normal levels of productivity in this digital environment we continue to monitor events related to the pandemic as well as the guidelines and mandates provided by governmental and health authorities we plan to continue adapting our business operations when and as deemed appropriate to comply with these guidelines and mandates and to respond to changing circumstances 

in connection with the shift to work from home we incurred and may continue to incur expenses to help employees perform their jobs effectively and securely in preparation for an eventual return to work in the office we have also incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses to help protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken steps to manage our costs including minimizing hiring to essential positions restricting business travel and canceling inperson marketing events we expect to continue to minimize travel and restrict inperson marketing events during the first half of 2021 overall the increased direct spend related to the covid19 pandemic including office reconfiguration has not been material to date and has had minimal impact on our financial position and operating results as these expenses have been generally offset by the cost savings described above as the situation evolves we may implement additional cost reductions 

current general economic conditions in the us and the world as a result of the covid19 pandemic are negatively affecting business operations for our clients and are expected to result in business consolidations and in certain circumstances failures in general customers are seeking to reduce expenses as a result of current economic conditions the extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the global economy is unknown there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the us and other economies will ultimately be successful or available to us and our customers and if successful when the benefits will be available or seen because of the rapidly evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and responses to it by and the impact on global economies our revenue or earnings forecasts may not prove to be accurate any expected changes in financial results discussed in this report including any expected impact of covid19 are based on our current observations and experience and involve estimates and assumptions as the extent and duration of the impacts from covid19 remain unclear our estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change our current observations and past experience and results may not be an indicator of ongoing trends or future results and actual results could differ significantly from our estimates and expectations 

our nearterm revenues are relatively predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model however we expect that we will continue to experience the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations and overall 

financial performance such effects may include among others a decrease in new customer sales and increases in customer cancellations suspensions service reductions and failures to pay or delays in payments of amounts owed to us we are more likely to incur asset impairment charges or restructuring charges or further increase our allowance for credit losses as a result of this crisis and related economic downturn which could adversely affect our results of operations the amount and frequency of such actions will be affected by the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic we experienced a decrease in net new bookings of subscriptionbased services and an increase in customer requests for cancellations and suspensions towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 that continued through may 2020 however those requests have eased since then and sales related to marketplace service offerings have returned to prepandemic levels during 2020 we increased the allowance for credit loss as a result of increased writeoff trends and increased the forecasted credit loss estimate on high credit risk customers to reflect the uncertainty around the duration and speed of an economic recovery in the first three quarters of 2020 however the credit loss expense normalized in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to th e uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic we will continue to monitor customer behavior and its impact on our results of operations see note 3 in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion  

we strengthened our liquidity position through an equity offering of common stock in may 2020 and an offering of senior notes and amendment and restatement of our credit facility in early july 2020 s ee note 11 and note 15 in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of our recent equity and senior notes offerings and our 2020 credit agreement the effects of the pan demic have not affected our ability to date to access funding on reasonably similar terms as were available to us prior to march 2020 we discuss the current and potential impact of select provisions of the cares act defined below in our liquidity discussion 

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 our annualized net new bookings of subscriptionbased services on all contracts were approximately 184 million 210 million and 169 million respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on all existing subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported we recognize subscription revenues on a straightline basis over the life of the contract net bookings is considered a key indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of salesforce productivity by management and investors 

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services on annual contracts was approximately 89 90 and 90 respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 11 10 and 10 respectively our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

development investments and expansion 

we plan to continue to invest in our business and our services evaluate strategic growth opportunities and pursue our key priorities as described below while we closely monitor the economic developments from the covid19 pandemic and manage our response to such developments we are committed to supporting improving and enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace solutions including expanding and improving our offerings for our client base and site users including property owners property managers buyers commercial tenants and residential renters we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate and crosssell services integrate recently completed acquisitions and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations we may reevaluate our priorities as the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve

to support our continued expansion and development in 2020 we completed a public equity offering a senior notes offering and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in may 2020 we completed a public equity offering of 26 million shares of common stock for 655 per share net proceeds from the public equity offering were approximately 17 billion after deducting approximately 35 million of underwriting fees commissions and other stock issuance costs we expect to use the net proceeds from the public equity offering to fund all or a portion of the costs of any strategic acquisitions we pursue in the future to finance the growth of our business andor for working capital and other general corporate purposes general corporate purposes may include additions to working capital capital expenditures repayment of debt investments in our subsidiaries and the repurchase redemption or retirement of securities including our common stock 

on july 1 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 2800 senior notes due july 15 2030 the “senior notes” interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning january 15 2021 we may redeem the senior notes in whole or in part a at any time prior to april 15 2030 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes plus the applicable premium as calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the senior notes as of and any accrued and unpaid interest if any on the principal amount of senior notes being redeemed to but excluding the redemption date and b on or after april 15 2030 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest if any on the principal amount of senior notes being redeemed to but excluding the redemption date we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay outstanding borrowings under the 2017 credit agreement and we intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund all or a portion of the costs of any strategic acquisitions we pursue in the future to finance the growth of our business andor for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

on july 1 2020 we also entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the “2020 credit agreement” which amended and restated in its entirety our existing credit agreement the 2017 credit agreement the 2020 credit 

agreement provides for a 750 million revolving credit facility with a term of five years and a letter of credit sublimit of 20 million from a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and issuing banks on july 1 2020 we repaid the outstanding borrowings under our existing 750 million revolving credit facility pursuant to the 2017 credit agreement using the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes funds drawn down on the revolving credit facility pursuant to the 2020 credit agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes the 2020 credit agreement along with the proceeds from the may equity offering the july senior notes offering and cash generated by our business are expected to support our continued growth and give us flexibility to act on strategic acquisition opportunities that may arise see notes 11 and 15 in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of our recent equity and senior notes offerings and our 2020 credit agreement 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services and functionality within our current platform or expand the reach of or otherwise improve our current service offerings any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to experience reduced revenues or generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future any development efforts must comply with our credit facility which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include net income before interest expense income and other expense income loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda is our net income before interest expense income and other expense income loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense  acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by revenues for the period nongaap net income is determined by adjusting our net income for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs and then subtracting an assumed provision for income taxes nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

we may disclose adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income is net income we believe the most directly comparable gaap financial measures to nongaap net income per diluted share and adjusted ebitda margin are net income per diluted share and net income divided by revenue respectively in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap 

net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income and net income per diluted share in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and accompanying reconciliations provide additional information to investors that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business without the impact of certain acquisitionrelated items we have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to these acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and loss on debt extinguishment adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year without the impact of these items we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest expense income and other expense income income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the diminishing value of any acquired trade names and other intangible assets and the use of our acquired technology which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• the amount of interest expense income and other expense income we generate and incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows and outflows however we do not consider the amount of interest expense income and other expense income to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

• income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds 

otherwise available for use in our business however we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

• the amount of loss on our debt extinguishment may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents losses from the early extinguishment of debt however we do not consider the amount of the loss on debt extinguishment to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from ebitda to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

• stockbased compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives determining the fair value of the stockbased instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stockbased awards therefore we believe it is useful to exclude stockbased compensation in order to better understand the longterm performance of our core business 

• the amount of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because such costs generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to acquisitions because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle we do not consider the amount of acquisition and integrationrelated costs to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

• the amount of settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent gains or losses from the settlement of litigation matters or impairments on acquired intangible assets we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 

• the amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in a contract or a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel we do not consider the amount of restructuring related costs to be a representative component of the daytoday operating performance of our business 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring and related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income in addition to these exclusions from net income we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2020 and 2019 we assumed a 25 tax rate which approximated our historical longterm statutory corporate tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to investors to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

revenues  revenues increased to 17 billion in 2020 from 14 billion in 2019 the 259 million increase was primarily attributable to an 108 million or 22 increase in multifamily revenue the multifamily increase was due to upsells of existing customer packages to higher value advertising packages and higher sales volume due to an increase in property listings as a result of recent investments in marketing commercial property and land revenue increased 63 million or 31 due to revenue of 32 million from the acquisition of tenx and growth in our loopnet online marketplace services of 30 million as a result of stronger site traffic driving sales of higher value advertisements costar suite revenues increased 47 million or 8 primarily due to renewal price increases from prior periods and to a lesser extent higher sales volume due to an increase in subscribers information services revenue increased 41 million or 47 primarily due to 44 million from the acquisition of str partially offset by a decrease of 2 million in revenue for our costar real estate manager service offerings 

gross profit  gross profit increased to 14 billion in 2020 from 11 billion in 2019 the gross profit percentage was 81 for 2020 compared to 79 for 2019 the increase in gross profit was due to higher revenues partially impacted by an increase in cost of revenues of 20 million or 7 mostly due to the acquisitions of str and tenx which were the primary drivers of higher personnel costs of 12 million and increased intangible asset amortization of 4 million and to a lesser extent increases in bank and merchant fees of 4 million and it equipment and office supplies of 4 million related to employees directly supporting our customers as they transitioned to working from home during the covid19 pandemic these increases were partially offset by a 4 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses for research and product support employees 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses increased to 536 million in 2020 from 409 million in 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to 92 million in additional marketing spend including 57 million in search engine marketing primarily for apartmentscom and loopnet a 40 million increase in marketing agency fees and a 6 million increase in other forms of marketing led by digital partially offset by a decrease in event spending of 11 million in addition the increase in expenses was caused by higher personnel costs of 40 million driven by the acquisitions of str and tenx as well as higher sales commissions in addition to 2 million increases in each of occupancy and supplies these increases were partially offset by a 9 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased to 163 million in 2020 from 126 million in 2019 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10 in 2020 compared to 9 in 2019 the increase in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to a 33 million increase in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount and temporary services to enhance our product offerings including 11 million due to the acquisitions of str and tenx as well as a 2 million increase in occupancy costs 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased to 300 million in 2020 from 179 million in 2019 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 18 in 2020 from 13 in 2019 the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially attributable to the 52 million break fee and 8 million in extension payments that we were contractually obligated to pay under the asset purchase agreement with rentpath which we terminated in december 2020 in addition there were increases in personnel costs of 27 million due to increased headcount driven by the acquisitions of str and tenx credit loss expense of 14 million primarily due to our expectations that the economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic will increase delinquent trade receivables professional services of 14 million driven by an increase in other acquisition related costs and additional software and equipment of 5 million 

customer base amortization expense customer base amortization expense increased to 62 million in 2020 from 34 million in 2019 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 4 in 2020 compared to 2 in 2019 the increase in customer base amortization expense was primarily due to the str and tenx acquisitions 

interest expense income interest expense income was a net expense of 17 million in 2020 as compared to net income of 17 million in 2019 the change from the prior year was due to an increase in interest expense of 19 million of which 5 million was related to the 745 million draw on the 2017 credit agreement in the first quarter of 2020 and 14 million related to our senior notes issued on july 1 2020 respectively in addition there was a decrease of 15 million in interest income caused by lower rates of return on our cash and cash equivalent balances compared to the prior year 

other expense income other expense income was a net expense of 1 million in 2020 as compared to net income of 11 million in 2019 the change was primarily due to 11 million in legal settlement proceeds received in 2019 

income tax expense income tax expense decreased to 44 million in 2020 from 76 million in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower income before income taxes for 2020 as well as an increase in excess tax benefits the effective tax rate for 2020 was 16 compared to 19 in 2019 and lower than the statutory rates due to research and development credits as well as excess tax benefits

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2020 and year ended december 31 2019 

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with the primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being north america which includes the us and canada and international which primarily includes europe asiapacific and latin america management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda which is our net income before interest expense income and other expense income loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of the business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  north america revenues increased to 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 from 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in north america revenues was primarily due to a 108 million increase in multifamily revenues driven by upsells of existing customer packages to higher value advertising packages and higher sales volume as a result of recent investments in marketing commercial property and land revenues increased 63 million primarily due to the acquisition of tenx as well as growth in our loopnet service offering costar suite revenues increased 44 million primarily due to price increases upon renewal of subscriptions in the past year and to a lesser extent higher sales volume information services increased 27 million due to the acquisition of str international revenues increased 

to 57 million for the year ended december 31 2020 from 40 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in international revenues was primarily due the acquisition of str 

segment ebitda north america ebitda decreased to 411 million for the year ended december 31 2020 from 452 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease in north america ebitda was due primarily to the 52 million break fee and 8 million in extension payments that we were contractually obligated to pay under the asset purchase agreement with rentpath which we terminated in december 2020 additionally increases in personnel general and administrative and marketing costs were offset by an increase in revenue international ebitda increased to a loss of 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 from a loss of 7 million december 31 2019 primarily as a result of increased revenue offset by increases in personnel and general and administrative costs

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

the following tables present our unaudited consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues these tables should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k the quarterly results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of quarterly results for any future period 





liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations and more recently proceeds from our debt and equity offerings total cash cash equivalents and restricted cash increased to approximately 38 billion as of december 31 2020 compared to approximately 11 billion as of december 31 2019 the increase in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to proceeds from our may 2020 equity offering net of transaction costs of 17 billion as well as proceeds from the july 2020 issuance of our senior notes net of transaction costs of 983 million in addition cash generated from operations contributed 486 million partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 426 million 

in may 2020 we completed a public equity offering of 26 million shares of common stock for 655 per share and on july 1 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes entered into the 2020 credit agreement which amended and restated in its entirety the 2017 credit agreement and repaid in full the balance on the existing 750 million revolving credit facility under the 2017 credit agreement for further discussion of our recent equity and senior notes offerings and our 2020 credit agreement see “—overview—development investments and expansion” and notes 11 and 15 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 486 million compared to 458 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the approximately 29 million increase from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital partially offset by a decrease in net income excluding certain noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and credit loss expense as well as a decrease in deferred income taxes 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 464 million compared to 484 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the 20 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 438 million net cash paid for acquisitions in 2019 which included the acquisitions of str and off campus partners compared to 426 million net cash paid during 2020 including the acquisitions of homesnap tenx and emporis gmbh as well as the sale of our ars investments of 10 million in 2020 this was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures to 48 million in 2020 compared to 46 million during 2019 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 27 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities of 4 million for the year ended december 31 2019 this 27 billion increase is primarily due to proceeds from our may 2020 equity offering net of transaction costs of 17 billion as well as proceeds from the issuance of our july 1 2020 senior notes net of transaction costs of 983 million we expect to use the proceeds from these transactions to fund all or a portion of the costs of any strategic acquisitions we pursue in the future to finance the growth of our business and for working capital and other general corporate purposes the increased cash position allows for greater financial flexibility in light of ongoing uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the covid19 pandemic s ee notes 11 and 15 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we expect to continue to make acquisitions on february 11 2020 our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the equity interests of reorganized rentpath following an internal restructuring pursuant to a chapter 11 plan of reorganization for 588 million in cash the purchase agreement required us to deposit a 59 million termination fee into an escrow account in the event the purchase agreement is terminated prior to closing under specified circumstances in december 2020 the sellers gave notice of termination of the purchase agreement and we commenced an adversary proceeding against the sellers seeking a declaratory judgment that rentpath was in breach of the agreement and that we were not obligated to pay the termination fee in february 2021 we and the sellers settled the adversary proceeding and agreed that we would pay 52 million of the 59 million contractual termination fee s ee note 13 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

on march 27 2020 president trump signed into law the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act the cares act among other things includes provisions relating to the deferral of taxes valuation allowances and balance sheet classifications as well as provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits deferral of employer social security payments net operating loss carryback periods alternative minimum tax credit refunds modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property as permitted under the cares act we deferred payroll taxes due in 2020 to 2021 and 2022 

as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient for us to maintain and fund our operations for at least the next twelve months our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future depends upon numerous rapidly evolving factors many of which we cannot accurately predict or assess including among others the length and severity of the economic downturn associated with the covid19 pandemic related disruption of the international and national economy and credit markets actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic such as office and other workplace closures worker absenteeism quarantines masstransit disruptions or other travel or healthrelated restrictions how quickly economies including the commercial real estate industry in particular recover after the pandemic subsidies sales of our services and collection of accounts receivables we plan to continue to monitor and evaluate the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic as it evolves 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2020 excluding the rentpath termination fee and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a thirdparty or us or iii employment agreements amounts do not include income taxes payable due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

• longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

• income taxes 

• revenue recognition 

• business combinations 

with respect to our accounting policy for longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill we further supplement in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k with the following 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

• significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 

• significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 

• significant negative industry or economic trends or 

• significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 

goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually by each reporting unit we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or we elect to bypass such assessment we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2020 we assessed the relevant qualitative factors for our north america reporting unit and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its respective carrying amounts we elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and performed the first 

step quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test for our international reporting unit in the current year which indicated that the fair value of this unit exceeded its carrying value 

there have been no events or changes in circumstances as a result of our qualitative impairment analysis on october 1 2020 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we provide information analytics and online marketplace services to commercial real estate and related business communities within the regions where we operate which primarily include north america europe asiapacific and latin america the functional currency for a majority of our operations is the local currency with the exception of certain str international locations for which the functional currency is the british pound 

fluctuations in the british pound canadian dollar and euro may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 revenues denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 5 and 4 respectively of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 our revenues would have decreased by approximately 8 million and 6 million if the us dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 10 for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 our revenues would have increased by approximately 8 million and 6 million if the us dollar exchange rate used weakened by 10 fluctuations in the exchange rates of revenues denominated in any other foreign currencies would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results in addition we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all as of december 31 2020 accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 09 million 

we do not believe we have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 we had 38 billion of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents we currently diversify our cash and cash equivalents holdings amongst multiple financial institutions 

we are subject to interest rate market risk in connection with our new revolving credit facility on july 1 2020 we entered into the 2020 credit agreement which provides for variable rate borrowings of up to 750 million on july 1 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 2800 senior notes due july 15 2030 changes in interest rates would not have a material impact to our current interest and debt financing expense as all our borrowings except for our credit facility are fixed rate and our credit facility is currently undrawn as of december 31 2020 see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k regarding our 2020 credit agreement 

we had approximately 27 billion of goodwill and intangible assets as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable however changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties forsale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics are instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of efforts in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database researchers our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

the apartment rental advertising industry serves property managers and owners who are tasked with finding renters to occupy vacant apartments as well as renters who are searching for their next home property managers have several options at their disposal including their own websites driveby and outdoor advertising traditional classified ads free online listing services search engine marketing and internet listings services “ils” like apartmentscom and the network of apartment listing websites we own and operate many apartment ils websites feature only the rental availabilities that larger property owners pay to advertise resulting in a poor user experience in which the renter’s search criteria return either limited or no results irrelevant results or stale results that do not represent actual availabilities 

we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information our apartment ils websites include renterfocused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria eg commute time to work professional images of the properties including immersive videos and 3d interactive models custom neighborhood profiles and tenant reviews our network of apartment listing websites draws on our multifamily database and includes researched and verified information we proactively gather information on available rentals to improve the accuracy of the listings on our apartment ils websites including real time unitlevel availability current pricing and rent specials we have continually invested in our network to improve the features and services offered to property managers and website users recent additions include dynamic lead forms that provide more information about prospective residents a reporting suite that provides customers with rent comparables making rent trends information publicly available and free digital ad retargeting and integrated online rental solutions including lease applications and tenant credit and background checks we believe that we have created and maintain easily searchable apartment ils websites with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods as well as easy to use and actionable tools for the rental process

costars field research effort includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new availabilities find additional property inventory new construction collect tenant information verify existing information photograph properties and create high quality videos of interior spaces including walkthrough videos and 3d virtual tours amenities and exterior features of properties costar utilizes hightech field research vehicles primarily within north america and europe a significant majority of these vehicles are customized energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to precisely measure buildings and geocode and position them on digital maps each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “forsale” or “forlease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information field researchers also canvass properties collecting tenant data suitebysuite costar also utilizes a lowflying airplane and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate we place researchers on the lowflying aircraft to scout additional commercial developments and take aerial photographs and videos our us drone operators are federal aviation administration certified and trained to capture aerial photographs and videos of commercial real estate our drone operators in the uk and canada are certified and trained to civil aviation authority standards with a permission for commercial operations pending 

data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps aerial photographs and 3d virtual apartment tours of apartment communities all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and online marketplaces 

management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

competition 

the market for information analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and extremely dynamic in the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

as the market for information analytics and online marketplaces develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplaces our subscriptionbased information analytics and online marketplaces generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business including competitors that offer their services through rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate net new sales and revenues may decline or fail to meet expectations 

  

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers and to successfully introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must be able to quickly adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department product development team management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts additional strain on our sales and marketing resources if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share or in obtaining widespread adoption of new or upgraded services we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the launch and marketing of the new or upgraded service which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for example to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our apartmentscom network of rental websites we invest significant resources in a multichannel marketing campaign if the marketing campaign does not continue to increase brand awareness site traffic andor revenues it could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services if we are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or if our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services then there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to a decrease of our revenues and a reduction of our profitability in addition as we integrate acquired businesses we continue to assess which services we believe will best meet the needs of our customers if we eliminate or phase out a service and are not able to offer and successfully market and sell an alternative service our revenue may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we do not invest in product development and provide services that are attractive to our marketplace users and to our advertisers our business could be adversely affected our success depends on our continued improvements to provide services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to our advertisers as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies if we are unable to provide services that users want then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors’ websites if we are unable to continue offering innovative services we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished 

rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a reversal of improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry may consolidate often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels wage and salary levels and uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of libor and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price further actions or inactions of the us or other major national governments including brexit may also impact economic conditions which could result in financial market disruptions or an economic downtown market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations see the risk factor below titled “the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results” for further discussion of risks related to brexit  

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization including field sales personnel if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers our competition for advertisers may have significant brand recognition as well as greater numbers of direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do which may provide a competitive advantage to compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell and landsofamerica which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase and the landcom network of rural lands forsale we expect to increase our investments in sales and marketing in 2020 as we seek 

to grow the numbers of subscribers to and advertisers on our marketplaces our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on our websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins we continue to invest in our business including internal investments in product development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and external investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of these investments furthermore our investments may not have their intended effect or produce the expected results in addition our external investments such as capitalized commissions may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites if internet search engines do not prominently feature our websites on the search engine results page traffic to our websites would decrease and our business could be adversely affected google bing duckduckgo and other internet search engines drive traffic to our websites including costarcom the apartmentscom network of rental websites the loopnetcom network of commercial real estate websites the bizbuysellcom network of business forsale websites and the landcom network of land forsale websites for example when a user enters in a search query for an apartment building name or address into an internet search engine the internet search engine’s ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed on the search engine results page our ability to maintain prominent search result rankings and positioning is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization seo and search engine marketing sem efforts may result in webpages from their websites receiving higher rankings than the webpages from our websites internet search engines could revise their algorithms and methodologies in ways that would adversely affect our search result rankings internet search engine providers could form partnerships or enter into other business relationships with our competitors resulting in competitors’ sites receiving higher search result rankings internet search engines are increasingly placing alternative search features such as featured snippets local map results and other immersive experiences on the search engine results page above or more prominently than search engine results if our search result rankings are not prominently displayed traffic to our websites may decline which could slow the growth of our user base our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations will occur in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

competition could render our services uncompetitive and reduce our profitability  the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general are highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers advertisers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace businesses depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites if we fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to and retain existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites our efforts to maintain or generate additional traffic to our marketplaces may not be successful even if we are able to attract additional users increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products we face competition to attract users to our marketplace websites our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to our own that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources if we are unable to increase traffic to our marketplaces or if we are unable to generate enough additional revenues to offset increases in expenses related to increasing traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites and the landcom network of rural lands forsale depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

 

further with respect to the apartmentscom network of rental websites our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

many of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have longterm contracts these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice in addition as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenues and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance integrate andor manage costs related to acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we are likely to incur costs in connection with proposed acquisitions but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate any particular proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including risks that we will not be able to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations manage the integration of personnel and products or services manage the integration of acquired infrastructure and controls control potential increases in operating costs manage geographically remote operations maintain management’s attention on other business concerns and avoid potential disruptions in ongoing operations during an acquisition process or integration efforts successfully enter markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience including foreign markets whose practices regulations or laws may pose increased risk and retain key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies for example we may be unable to close the rentpath acquisition when or as expected and we may be unable to fully integrate str with costar when and as expected 

we often incur severance costs and other integration costs postacquisition such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

external factors such as compliance with laws and regulations and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful integration of an acquired business an acquired business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness including as a result of unsuccessful integration or because integration with our existing systems puts additional stress on our core infrastructure acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to complete future acquisitions if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain or may be denied if regulatory approval is obtained the terms of any such approval may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business 

if regulatory approval is denied we may incur significant additional costs payable to an acquisition target as a result of failure to close the transaction 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients and vendors we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we collect store and use biometric data and sensitive or confidential transaction and account information in addition we collect personal information from tenants and landlords including social security numbers state or federally issued identification numbers dates of birth financial information and documents employment information background checks and credit scores to facilitate the apartment rental application and payment process between a renter and property manager as a result we are subject to a variety of state national and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data including the fair credit reporting act the general data protection regulation gdpr and california consumer privacy act ccpa laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations for example in 2016 the eu formally adopted the gdpr which was implemented in all eu member states effective may 25 2018 and replaced the eu data protection directive the gdpr introduced new data protection requirements in the eu and imposes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process we continue to assess our compliance with gdpr in light of guidance from data protection authorities evolving best practices and evolving regulations and we may need to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new eu data protection rules the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 expands the rights of california residents to access and require deletion of their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation any failure to comply with the rules arising from the gdpr and related national laws of eu member states ccpa and other privacy or data protection laws adopted by other jurisdictions could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us and could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations compliance with any of the foregoing laws and regulations can be costly can delay or impede the development of new products and may require us to change the way we operate we may incur substantial fines if we violate any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information 

our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable privacy or data security laws regulations and policies or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions and significant penalties against us which could result in negative publicity increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products if so in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims and penalties we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products which could harm our business 

we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states and other jurisdictions and we cannot determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites we could be subject to legal claims government action harm to our reputation or incur significant remediation costs if we experience a security breach or our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

concern regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites or collected when performing our services could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition as stated above our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data we also collect store and process employee personal data an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information 

security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to a targets systems data or customers data disable or degrade services or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce for example through spear phishing attacks or social engineering our employees customers vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems our cybersecurity programs and efforts to protect our systems and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents may not prevent these threats or provide security further the security measures and procedures our customers vendors and other users of our systems have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches cyberattacks or system failures 

our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ or employees’ personal or proprietary information that is stored on or accessible through those systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of our security could among other things 

• interrupt our operations 

• result in our systems or services being unavailable 

• result in improper disclosures of data 

• materially harm our reputation and brands 

• result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure 

• cause us to incur significant remediation costs 

• lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services 

• divert the attention of management from the operation of our business 

• result in significant contractual penalties or other payments as a result of thirdparty losses or claims and 

• adversely affect our business and result of operations 

in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects on our business the coverage under our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards for customer payments we accept payments for our services through credit and debit card transactions for credit and debit card payments we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time an increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our cost of revenues either of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards cardholders and transactions if we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit cardrelated costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events our users rely on our services when conducting their own businesses disruptions in or reductions in ability to access our services for whatever reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or result in reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and online marketplaces which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or directly from brokers through the marketing center feature on costar and loopnet or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors or conditions quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations new services or other significant or strategic information general conditions in the commercial real estate industry general conditions of local national or global economies developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights we find our proprietary content on competitors sites if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which our services may be provided the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position 

we seek to enforce our rights against people and entities that infringe our intellectual property including through legal action taking such action may be costly and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

third party claims litigation or government investigations to which we are subject or in which we become involved regardless of their merit may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  we could be subject to third party claims lawsuits or government investigations into whether our business practices comport with applicable law including antitrust law regardless of the merit of such claims or investigations defending against them could cost us a significant amount of time and money result in negative publicity andor adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are decided against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws 

and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation in the marketplace our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web product and development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 19 billion of goodwill including approximately 17 billion in our north america operating segment and approximately 144 million in our international operating segment 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to the loopnetcom network of commercial real estate websites the apartmentscom network of rental websites and the landcom network of land forsale websites could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of property listings submitted by brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including the bizbuysellcom network of business forsale websites are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are accustomed to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business forsale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses forsale our revenues could be negatively affected 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenues and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets impose additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries including differing laws regarding privacy and data protection difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion sometimes exceeds the profit generated from such expansion which reduces our profitability and may adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our international acquisitions and expansion efforts a portion of our business is denominated in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” on january 31 2020 the uk officially withdrew from the eu beginning a transition period of negotiations between the british government and the eu and other governments uncertainty regarding the uk’s withdrawal from the eu could cause political and economic uncertainty in the uk and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results in particular brexit could result in significant volatility in global equity markets currency exchange rates and other asset prices including those related to real property the impact to us from brexit will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations the results of which are currently uncertain this impact may affect not only our uk operations but operations in other parts of the eu any transitional or permanent agreements resulting from such negotiations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 

a potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the us dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease or cancel orders or terminate or fail to renew subscriptions for our services we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars resulting asset price volatility that could follow the withdrawal of the uk from the eu may create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services in addition brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly in terms of compliance further brexit may lead other eu member countries to consider referendums regarding their eu membership any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

changes in laws regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could increase our cost of doing business for example in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act and various provisions of the new law may adversely affect us certain aspects of tax reform are unclear and may not be clarified for some time during 2018 the department of the treasury issued certain guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations with respect to several provisions of the new legislation we expect that additional regulations or other guidance may be issued with respect to the tax act in subsequent years we continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business in addition if federal state local or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or issue new guidance including in response to the tax act our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

our indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs  the 2017 credit agreement provides for a 750 million revolving credit facility with a term of five years from a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and issuing banks the 2017 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things i incur additional indebtedness ii create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv make investments and acquisitions v make certain dispositions of assets vi make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2017 credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the 2017 credit agreement if an event of default occurs the interest rate on any overdue amounts will increase and the lenders under the 2017 credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the 2017 credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted forsale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2019  we held 11 million par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected the commercial real estate market may be influenced 

by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results we generally see higher sales of apartmentscom listing services during the peak summer rental season and higher costar suite sales towards the end of the year however sales fluctuate from yeartoyear in addition we generally incur greater marketing expenses during the second quarter which coincides with the peak season for apartment rentals the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slowdowns during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov requires us to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires us to license our products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition we are required to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions for which notification would not otherwise be required under the hartscottrodino premerger notification act this provision of the consent order requiring costar to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions could prevent us from closing certain acquisitions or add significant time and cost to these potential acquisitions ultimately making an acquisition prohibitive or preventing us from realizing anticipated benefits of an acquisition in the event that we fail or are unable to comply with the terms of the consent order we could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline

for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 our annualized net new bookings of subscriptionbased services on all contracts were approximately 210 million  169 million and 148 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on all existing subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported we recognize subscription revenues on a straightline basis over the life of the contract net bookings is considered a key indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of salesforce productivity by management and investors 

for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services on annual contracts was approximately 90  90 and 91 respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 10  10  and 9  respectively our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include net income before interest and other income expense loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda is our net income before interest and other income expense loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs for pending and completed acquisitions restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income is determined by adjusting our net income for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs for pending and completed acquisitions restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs and then subtracting an assumed provision for income taxes we may disclose adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income is net income we believe the most directly comparable gaap financial measures to nongaap net income per diluted share and adjusted ebitda margin are net income per diluted share and net income divided by revenue respectively in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and non 

gaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income and net income per diluted share in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and accompanying reconciliations provide additional information to investors that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and online marketplace services which has included acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs for pending and completed acquisitions restructuring costs and loss on debt extinguishment adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs for pending and completed acquisitions restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs for pending and completed acquisitions restructuring costs loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from ebitda to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integration related costs for pending and completed acquisitions restructuring and related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income in addition to these exclusions from net income we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2019 and 2018  we assumed a 25 tax rate which approximated our historical longterm statutory corporate tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items 

adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by revenues for the period 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

revenues  revenues increased to 14 billion in 2019  from 12 billion in 2018  the 208 million increase was primarily attributable to an 85 million  or 21  increase in multifamily revenue the multifamily increase was due to upgrades of existing customer packages to higher value advertising packages higher volume as a result of recent investments in marketing and to a lesser extent growth from the acquisitions of cozy and ocp costar suite revenues increased 73 million  or 13  primarily due to further increases in pricing and to a lesser extent further market penetration and crossselling of our services commercial property and land revenue increased 30 million  or 17  primarily due to growth in our loopnet online marketplace services of 23 million as well as growth in our land and businesses forsale services of 6 million information services revenue increased 21 million  or 31  primarily due to increased revenue of 13 million from our costar real estate manager service offerings and 9 million due to the acquisition of str 

gross profit  gross profit increased to 11 billion in 2019  from 922 million in 2018  the gross profit percentage was 79 for 2019 compared to 77 for 2018 as revenues increased at a higher rate than cost of revenues the increase in cost of revenues of 19 million  or 7  was primarily due to additional merchant fees and data and content costs of 9 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of cozy additional personnel costs of 8 million and additional costs for research equipment of 3 million the increase from the prior year was partially offset by nonrecurring research personnel restructuring costs incurred in the prior year of 3 million 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses increased to 409 million in 2019  from 360 million in 2018  the increase was primarily attributable to 41 million in additional marketing spend including 23 million in search engine marketing 7 million in cobranding and 11 million in other forms of marketing primarily for apartmentscom the increase was also due to a 5 million increase in personnel costs driven by increased headcount partially offset by higher severance and retention costs incurred in 2018 related to the acquisition of forrent 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased to 126 million in 2019  from 101 million in 2018  and increased as a percentage of revenues to 9 in 2019  compared to 8 in 2018  the increase in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to a 22 million increase in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to enhance our product offerings including 2 million due to the acquisition of str 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased to 179 million in 2019  from 157 million in 2018  and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at 13 in 2019 and 2018  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to personnel costs of 12 million due to increased headcount 4 million as a result of the acquisition of str bad debt expense of 4 million additional software and equipment of 4 million depreciation expense of 2 million and travel and conference expenses of 1 million each partially offset by a 5 million decrease in professional services

interest and other income interest and other income increased to 30 million in 2019  from 13 million in 2018  the increase was primarily due to 11 million in legal settlement proceeds received during 2019 as well as higher rates of return and average cash and cash equivalent balances during 2019 compared to 2018 

interest and other expense interest and other expense remained consistent for 2019 and 2018 and primarily consists of commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs 

income tax expense income tax expense increased to 76 million in 2019  from 46 million in 2018  the increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes for 2019 and to a lesser extent discrete items for higher state research and development tax credits recognized for 2018 the effective tax rate for 2019 was 19 compared to 16 in 2018 and lower than the statutory rates due to discrete items including research and development credits as well as excess tax benefits

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2019 and year ended december 31 2018 

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with the primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being north america which includes the us and canada and international which primarily includes europe asiapacific and latin america management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment net income before interest and other income expense loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of the business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  north america revenues increased to 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  from 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in north america revenues was primarily due to a 85 million increase in multifamily revenues driven by the sale of higher value advertising packages and volume and to a lesser extent the acquisition of cozy and continued organic growth in costar suite revenues of 71 million  there were also increases of 29 million and 18 million in commercial property and land and information services respectively primarily due to growth in our loopnet and costar real estate manager service offerings and to a lesser extent the acquisition of str international revenues increased to 40 million for the year ended december 31 2019  from 35 million for the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in international revenues was primarily due the acquisition of str and further growth of our subscriptionbased services 

segment ebitda north america ebitda increased to 452 million for the year ended december 31 2019  from 358 million for the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in north america ebitda was due primarily to an increase in revenues partially offset by increases in personnel and marketing costs international ebitda remained consistent at a loss of 7 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018

operations in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018  which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 28 2019  

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

the following tables present our unaudited consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues these tables should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k the quarterly results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of quarterly results for any future period 





liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations we also have access to 750 million from our revolving credit facility in total cash and cash equivalents decreased by 30 million at december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018  primarily due to the cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of str and ocp for an aggregate amount of 438 million  cash paid for purchases of property and equipment of 46 million and repurchases of restricted stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock awards valued at approximately 28 million  these decreases were partially offset by net cash generated from operations of 458 million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of approximately 25 million  

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 458 million compared to 335 million for the year ended december 31 2018  the approximately 123 million increase from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net income of 77 million including an increase in other noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation expense and the timing of collections for accounts receivable partially offset by 15 million placed into an escrow account for deferred compensation for certain str employees 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 484 million compared to 448 million for the year ended december 31 2018  the 36 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to approximately 418 million of net cash paid to acquire forrent cozy and realla during 2018  compared to 438 million net cash paid during 2019 for the str and ocp acquisitions during 2019  we made capital expenditures of approximately 46 million compared to approximately 30 million during 2018  the increase in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2019 was partially driven by the purchase of a corporate aircraft which is principally used for business travel by our executives 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 4 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 3 million for the year ended december 31 2018  this 7 million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher repurchases of restricted stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock awards of 3 million  as well as a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 2 million  

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we expect to continue to make acquisitions on february 11 2020 our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the equity interests of reorganized rentpath following an internal restructuring pursuant to a chapter 11 plan of reorganization for 588 million in cash the purchase agreement requires us to pay a 59 million fee in the event the purchase agreement is terminated prior to closing under specified circumstances the acquisition will be funded using cash on hand s ee note 19 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a thirdparty or us or iii employment agreements amounts do not include income taxes payable due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

with respect to our accounting policy for longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill we further supplement in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k with the following 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 

goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually by each reporting unit we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or we elect to bypass such assessment we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2019 we assessed the relevant qualitative factors and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was less than their respective carrying amounts there have been no events or changes in circumstances as a result of our qualitative impairment analysis on october 1 2019 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable

we provide information analytics and online marketplace services to commercial real estate and related business communities within the regions where we operate which primarily include north america europe asiapacific and latin america the functional currency for a majority of our operations is the local currency with the exception of certain str international locations for which the functional currency is the british pound 

fluctuations in the british pound canadian dollar and euro may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position for the year ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  revenues denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 4 and 3  respectively of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  our revenues would have decreased by approximately 6 million and 3 million if the us dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 10 for the year ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  our revenues would have increased by approximately 6 million and 3 million if the us dollar exchange rate used weakened by 10 fluctuations in the exchange rates of revenues denominated in any other foreign currencies would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results in addition we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all as of december 31 2019  accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 8 million  

we do not believe we have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december 31 2019  as of december 31 2019  we had 11 billion of cash and cash equivalents if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 

included within our shortterm and longterm investments are investments in mostly aaarated student loan ars these securities are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education as of december 31 2019  11 million of our investments in ars failed to settle at auction as a result we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par resulting in a loss if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments as a temporary impairment and recognize a greater unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss or as an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future see notes 5 and 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

we had approximately 23 billion of goodwill and intangible assets as of december 31 2019  as of december 31 2019  we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable however changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

development investments and expansion 

we are committed to supporting improving and enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace solutions including expanding and improving our offerings for property managers and renters we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate and crosssell services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations 

we evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs further in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs we may decide to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that among other things overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer in the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings we may experience reduced revenues and earnings the decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services however we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings if any resulting from the elimination or phasing out of any service offering 

in 2018 we completed the integration of forrent including the forrent sales team and the services offered by forrent and have worked to maintain forrents relationships with its customers that existed prior to the acquisition forrentcom is expected to remain a distinct complementary brand to apartmentscom giving property managers and owners more exposure for their listings 

we are also continuing to develop new and improve existing online rental property service offerings for the apartments industry we plan to integrate the cozy suite technology into the aparmentscom platform creating an integrated online rental solution in particular we expect to implement the ability for renters to apply for leases online for landlords to run tenant credit and background checks online and eventually for landlords and tenants to generate and enter into leases and to make and process payments online

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics are instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial 

real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database researchers our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

the apartment rental advertising industry serves property managers and owners who are tasked with finding renters to occupy vacant apartments and renters who are searching for their next home property managers have several options at their disposal including their own websites driveby and outdoor advertising traditional classified ads free online listing services and internet listings services “ils” like apartmentscom and the network of apartment listing websites we own and operate many apartment ils websites feature only the rental availabilities that larger property owners pay to advertise resulting in a poor user experience in which the renter’s search criteria return either limited or no results irrelevant results or stale results that do not represent actual availabilities 

we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information our apartment ils websites include renterfocused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria eg commute time to work professional images of the properties including immersive videos and 3d interactive models custom neighborhood profiles and tenant reviews our network of apartment listing websites draws on our multifamily database and includes researched and verified information we proactively gather information on available rentals to improve the accuracy of the listings on our apartment ils websites including real time unitlevel availability current pricing and rent specials we have continually invested in our network to improve the features and services offered to property managers and website users recent additions include dynamic lead forms that provide more information about prospective residents a reporting suite that provides customers with rent comparables making rent trends information publicly available and free digital ad retargeting we believe that we have created and maintain easily searchable apartment ils websites with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods

data and image providers  we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps aerial photographs and 3d virtual apartment tours of apartment communities all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and online marketplaces 

management and quality control systems  our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

competition 

the market for information analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the market for information analytics and online marketplaces develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplaces our subscriptionbased information analytics and online marketplaces generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business including competitors that offer their services through rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate net new sales and revenues may decline or fail to meet expectations 

  

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers and to successfully introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department product development team management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together and how we can best address those uses through standalone services or combinations of coordinating applications in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts additional strain on our sales and marketing resources if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the launch and marketing of the new or upgraded service which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for example to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our apartmentscom network of rental websites we utilize a multichannel marketing campaign if the marketing campaign does not continue to increase brand awareness site traffic andor revenues it could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services if we are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or if our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services then there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to a decrease of our revenues and a reduction of our profitability in addition as we integrate acquired businesses we continue to assess which services we believe will best meet the needs of our customers if we eliminate or phase out a service and are not able to offer and successfully market and sell an alternative service our revenue may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a reversal of improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry may consolidate often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to 

cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price further actions or inactions of the us or other major national governments including brexit may also impact economic conditions which could result in financial market disruptions or an economic downtown market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations see the risk factor below titled “the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results” for further discussion of risks related to brexit  

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization including field sales personnel if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers our competition for advertisers may have significant brand recognition as well as greater numbers of direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do which may provide a competitive advantage to compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell and landsofamerica which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase and the landcom network of rural lands for sale we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing as we seek to grow the numbers of subscribers to and advertisers on our marketplaces our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on our websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites if search results do not feature our websites prominently traffic to our websites would decrease and our business could be adversely affected google bing yahoo and other internet search websites drive traffic to our websites including costarcom the apartmentscom network of rental websites loopnetcom 

bizbuysellcom and the landcom network of land for sale websites for example when a user types an apartment building address into an internet search engine organic search ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed in the search results however our ability to maintain high organic search result rankings is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization or seo efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than the rankings our websites receive or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings each of which could slow the growth of our user base further search engine providers could align with our competitors which could adversely affect traffic to our websites our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace businesses depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites if we fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to and retain existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites our efforts to maintain or generate additional traffic to our marketplaces may not be successful even if we are able to attract additional users increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products we face competition to attract users to our marketplace websites our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to our own that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources if we are unable to increase traffic to our marketplaces or if we are unable to generate enough additional revenues to offset increases in expenses related to increasing traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase and the landcom network of rural lands for sale depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

 

further with respect to the apartmentscom network of rental websites our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

many of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have longterm contracts these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice in addition as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenues and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we do not invest in product development and provide services that are attractive to our users and to our advertisers our business could be adversely affected  our success depends on our continued improvements to provide services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to our advertisers as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies if we are unable to provide services that users want to use then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors’ websites if we are 

unable to continue offering innovative services we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance integrate andor manage costs related to acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in connection with an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products or services managing the integration of acquired infrastructure and controls potential increases in operating costs managing geographically remote operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential disruptions in ongoing operations during integration the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies for example we may be unable to fully integrate cozy technology into the apartmentscom platform when and as expected or fully utilize and realize the benefits of reallas expertise in capturing listings data to facilitate our expansion strategy in other european markets 

we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate prior acquisitions such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

external factors such as compliance with laws and regulations and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful integration of an acquired business an acquired business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to complete future acquisitions if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain or may be denied and if obtained the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients and vendors we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we collect store and use biometric data and sensitive or confidential transaction and account information in addition we collect personal information from tenants and landlords including social security numbers state or federal issued identification numbers dates of birth financial information and documents employment information background checks and credit scores to facilitate the apartment rental application process between a renter and property manager as a result we are subject to a variety of state national and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data including the fair credit reporting act laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations for example in 2016 the eu formally adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which was implemented in all eu member states effective may 25 2018 and replaced the eu data protection directive the gdpr introduced new data protection requirements in the eu and imposes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process we continue to assess our compliance with gdpr in light of guidance from data protection authorities evolving best practices and evolving regulations and we may need to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new eu data protection rules any failure to comply with the rules arising from the eu data protection directive the gdpr and related national laws of eu member states could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us and could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations compliance with any of the foregoing laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new products we may incur substantial fines if we violate any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information 

our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable privacy or data security laws regulations and policies or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions and significant penalties against us which could result in negative publicity 

increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products if so in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims and penalties we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products which could harm our business 

we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states and other jurisdictions and we cannot determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies we could be subject to legal claims government action harm to our reputation or incur significant remediation costs if we experience a security breach or our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

concern regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites or collected when performing our services could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition as stated above our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data we also collect store and process employee personal data an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to a targets systems data or customers data disable or degrade services or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce for example through spear phishing attacks or social engineering our employees customers vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems our cybersecurity programs and efforts to protect our systems and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents may not prevent these threats or provide security further the security measures and procedures our customers vendors and other users of our systems have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches cyberattacks or system failures 

our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ or employees’ personal or proprietary information that is stored on or accessible through those systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of our security could among other things 

• interrupt our operations 

• result in our systems or services being unavailable 

• result in improper disclosures of data 

• materially harm our reputation and brands 

• result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure 

• cause us to incur significant remediation costs 

• lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services 

• divert the attention of management from the operation of our business 

• result in significant contractual penalties or other payments as a result of third party losses or claims and 

• adversely affect our business and result of operations 

in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects on our business the coverage under our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards for customer payments  we accept payments for our services through credit and debit card transactions for credit and debit card payments we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time an increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our cost of revenues either of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards cardholders and transactions if we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit cardrelated costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events our users rely on our services when conducting their own businesses disruptions in or reductions in ability to access our services for whatever reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or result in reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and online marketplaces which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the 

foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or directly from brokers through the listing manager feature on costar or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors or conditions quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations new services or other significant or strategic information general conditions in the commercial real estate industry general conditions of local national or global economies developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

competition could render our services uncompetitive and reduce our profitability  the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers advertisers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins we continue to invest in our business including internal investments in product development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of investments furthermore our investments may not have their intended effect or produce the expected results in addition our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including 

intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which our services may be provided the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position 

we seek to enforce our rights against people and entities that infringe our intellectual property including through legal action taking such action may be costly and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

third party claims litigation or government investigations to which we are subject or in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various third party claims lawsuits or government investigations any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved whether as plaintiff or defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation in the marketplace our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web product and development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under 

a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 16 billion  of goodwill including 16 billion  in our north america operating segment and 38 million  in our international operating segment 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of property listings submitted by brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including bizbuysell and bizquest are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are accustomed to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale our revenues could be negatively affected 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenues and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries including differing laws regarding privacy and data protection difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited property and portfolio research ltd grecam sas realla ltd the assets of belbex corporate sl thomas daily as well as our expansion into canada a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound euro and canadian dollar as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results  on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the united kingdom provided its official notice to the european council that it intends to leave the european union commencing a period of up to two years for the uk and the other eu member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal uncertainty over the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu could cause political and economic uncertainty in the uk and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results in particular brexit could result in significant volatility in global equity markets currency exchange rates and other asset prices including those related to real property the impact to us from brexit will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations the results of which are currently uncertain this impact may affect not only our uk operations but operations in other parts of the eu any transitional or permanent agreements resulting from such negotiations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 

a potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the us dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease or cancel orders or terminate or fail to renew subscriptions for our services 

we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars resulting asset price volatility that could follow the withdrawal of the uk from the eu may create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly in terms of compliance further brexit may lead other eu member countries to consider referendums regarding 

their eu membership any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

changes in laws regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could increase our cost of doing business in particular there may be significant changes in us laws and regulations by the current us presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses including our business the current us presidential administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies and recently adopted tax reform legislation if the current us presidential administration materially modifies us laws and regulations or fiscal and other tax policies our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act and various provisions of the new law may adversely affect us certain aspects of tax reform are unclear and may not be clarified for some time during 2018 the department of the treasury issued certain guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations with respect to several provisions of the new legislation we expect that additional regulations or other guidance may be issued with respect to the tax act in 2019 and subsequent years we continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business in addition if federal state local or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or issue new guidance including in response to the tax act our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

our indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs  the 2017 credit agreement provides for a 750 million revolving credit facility with a term of five years from a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and issuing banks the 2017 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things i incur additional indebtedness ii create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv make investments and acquisitions v make certain dispositions of assets vi make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2017 credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the 2017 credit agreement if an event of default occurs the interest rate on overdue amounts will increase and the lenders under the 2017 credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the 2017 credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2018  we held 11 million  par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected  the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions 

or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results in addition our results may be impacted by seasonality the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slowdowns during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company    on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov requires us to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires us to license our products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition we are required to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions for which notification would not otherwise be required under the hartscottrodino premerger notification act this provision of the consent order requiring costar to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions could prevent us from closing certain acquisitions or add significant time and cost to these potential acquisitions ultimately making an acquisition prohibitive or preventing us from realizing anticipated benefits of an acquisition in the event that we fail or are unable to comply with the terms of the consent order we could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline

 as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  our annualized net bookings of subscriptionbased services on all contracts were approximately 50 million  43 million  and 29 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on all existing subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported we recognize subscription revenues on a straightline basis over the life of the contract net bookings is considered a key indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of salesforce productivity by management and investors 

for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services on annual contracts was approximately 90  91  and 90  respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 10  9  and 10  respectively our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include net income before interest and other income expense loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share also referred to as “nongaap eps” ebitda is our net income before interest and other income expense loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs from this figure we then subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to arrive at nongaap net income we may disclose adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and accompanying reconciliations provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and online marketplace services which has included acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and loss on debt extinguishment adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from ebitda to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integration related costs restructuring and related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2017  and 2016  we assumed a 38 tax rate which approximated our historical longterm statutory corporate tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items in 2018  we assumed a 25 tax rate which reflects our full year 2018 statutory tax rate the decrease in our tax rate in 2018 is mainly due to the tax act which reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 

adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by revenues for the period 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

revenues  revenues increased  to 1192 million  in 2018  from 965 million  in 2017  the 227 million   increase  was primarily attributable to increased revenues of approximately 82 million  or 18 from continued organic growth of costar suite as well as conversion of our loopnet customers to our costar platform as a result of integration of the loopnet and costar databases information services revenue decreased 5 million or 7 primarily due to the continued wind down of loopnet information services including premium searcher resulting in a loss of 29 million of revenues partially offset by a 22 million increase in revenues from the continued growth of our costar real estate manager offering multifamily revenue increased 126 million or 45  driven by incremental revenues related to the acquisition of forrent commercial property and land revenue increased 24 million or 16  due to growth in our loopnet online marketplace services of 12 million as well as growth in our land and businesses for sale services of 12 million

interest and other income  interest and other income increased  to 13 million  in 2018  from 4 million  in 2017  the increase was primarily due to our higher average cash and cash equivalent balance and interest rates in 2018 than in 2017 

interest and other expense  interest and other expense decreased  to 3 million  in 2018  from 9 million  in 2017  the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding debt in connection with entering into the amended and restated credit agreement the ‘‘2017 credit agreement’’ in october 2017 

loss on extinguishment  the loss on extinguishment recognized in 2017 was due to entering into the 2017 credit agreement which amended and restated in its entirety the existing credit agreement dated april 1 2014 and resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately 4 million  

income tax expense  income tax expense increased  to 46 million  in 2018  from 42 million  in 2017  the effective tax rate was 16 in 2018 compared to 26 in 2017 this decrease was primarily due to the tax act which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate effective january 1 2018 from 35 to 21 and excess tax benefits on share payments and state research and development tax credits

increase s from december 31 2017  to december 31 2018  and from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  respectively are primarily due to higher income from operations in both periods income from operations was partially offset by fluctuations in working capital

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we expect to continue to make acquisitions any future acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make any future acquisitions 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2018  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a thirdparty or us or iii employment agreements amounts do not include income taxes payable of 17 million  due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

with respect to our accounting policy for longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill we further supplement in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k with the following 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 

goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually by each reporting unit the company may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or the company elects to bypass such assessment the company then determines the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2017 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances as a result of our qualitative impairment analysis on october 1 2018  that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable

we had approximately 2 billion  in intangible assets as of december 31 2018  as of december 31 2018  we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable however changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

expansion and growth

we have continually expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information analytics and online marketplace services in addition to internal growth we have grown our business through strategic acquisitions our more recent acquisitions include the june 1 2015 acquisition of network communications inc “nci” including its apartment finder business collectively referred to as “apartment finder” to further support our expansion into the multifamily vertical apartment finder provides lead generation advertising and internet marketing solutions to property managers and owners through its main service apartmentfindercom on july 1 2015 we acquired the assets of belbex corporate sl “belbex” a small commercial real estate information provider operating in madrid spain on may 3 2016 we acquired thomas daily gmbh “thomas daily” a commercial real estate news and information provider operating in freiburg germany on january 31 2017 we acquired koa lei inc doing business as westside rentals and now known as westside rentals llc an online marketplace specializing in southern california real estate rentals and its affiliated entity westside credit services llc a provider of credit checks and tenant screening for landlords in the southern california real estate rental market on may 10 2017 we added landwatchcom to our network of landdedicated sites through our acquisition of landwatch on july 18 2017 we acquired the screening pros llc an online apartment leasing platform that includes tenant screening services rental applications and payments processing and lease renewals most recently on february 21 2018 we completed the acquisition of forrent a division of dominion enterprises forrent’s primary service is digital advertising through a network of four multifamily websites  which includes forrentcom after55com corporatehousingcom and forrentuniversitycom we plan to integrate develop and crosssell the services offered by forrent forrentcom is expected to remain a distinct complementary brand to apartmentscom giving property managers and owners more exposure for their listings 

development and expansion 

we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate and crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our information news analytic and online marketplace solutions 

the launch of the apartmentscom website and the apartmentfindercom website in 2015 are examples of our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services and integrate and crosssell existing services we believe the improved sites enhanced search capabilities availability of information regarding realtime vacancies and our continued development and introduction of enhancements to our online apartment rental marketplaces have attracted more consumers making the sites more attractive to property managers which has also increased our crossselling opportunities in 2017 we launched apartamentoscom an apartmentlisting site offered exclusively in spanish and built and tailored to meet the needs of spanish language households in the us which is believed to represent approximately 20 percent of the us renter population we believe greater functionality makes our services valuable to an even broader audience and helps us increase sales of our services to brokers banks owners institutional investors and other industry participants we expect technology enhancements to drive continued revenue growth in 2018 

we evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs further in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs we may decide to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that among other things overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer in the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings we may experience reduced revenues and earnings the decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services in 2017 we began to transition the loopnet marketplace to a pure paytolistfreetosearch marketing site for commercial real estate and to convert loopnet information customers to higher value costar suite information services we completed integrating the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases during the second half of 2017 the two services now share a unified database of information creating operating efficiencies and improving the data available to our customers we also introduced new enhancements on the costar homepage including a listing manager feature that we believe will increase the quantity and quality of the listing information available by enabling brokers and other industry participants to load information directly into the integrated system in turn we expect this feature will reduce the time and costs associated with researching and maintaining our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information 

we continue to assess the potential impact of the transition of the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where all listings are paid and users can search the site for free we are currently focused on converting loopnet information customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services which should increase revenues and earnings over time however we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings 

or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings if any resulting from the elimination or phasing out of the loopnet information services or any other service offering 

our revenues have increased as a result of revenues from acquired businesses and from crossselling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies we expect to continue to increase revenues as a result of such crossselling opportunities we may incur increased expenses in connection with any marketing and sales campaigns involving crossselling opportunities and initiatives and in connection with promotion of our new services and brands 

we are expanding the geographic reach of our north america services in 2014 we began our canadian research operations in toronto in 2015 we expanded into calgary and vancouver in 2016 we began offering services in ottawa and edmonton on july 1 2015 we expanded our international services into madrid spain through the acquisition of the assets of belbex a small commercial real estate information provider operating in madrid spain further on may 3 2016 we expanded our international services into key markets in germany through the acquisition of thomas daily a commercial real estate news and information provider operating in freiburg germany we believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services including expansion of our existing service offerings have created a platform for longterm revenue growth we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscriptionbased services and the successful crossselling of our services to customers in existing markets 

we have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company and our service offerings in north america and internationally we plan to continue to invest in evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the company continues to develop and grow we also continue to invest in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to support the apartmentscom network to expand into additional canadian markets and to provide services in madrid spain and key markets in germany we established our research operations headquarters in richmond virginia which is developing into a technology innovation hub powering the software development necessary to support the content within our information analytics and marketing services in connection with the opening of the richmond research headquarters we expanded our research team to continue to meet the growing content needs of our clients in addition we expect to continue to invest in our international research operations in madrid spain and the uk while we believe investments we make in our business create a platform for growth those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research and sales and marketing organizations we are committed to continuing to support and improve our information analytics and online marketplace solutions 

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database researchers  our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

within the apartment rental community most apartment listing websites primarily supply only the listings that property owners pay to advertise and often return results that are inconsistent with the renters search criteria these limited results generally do not provide information about the actual rental availabilities we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information to create the apartmentscom apartmentfindercom and apartamentoscom websites we drew on our multifamily database and undertook a research effort collecting and verifying information and visiting and photographing properties with the apartmentscom apartmentfindercom and apartamentoscom websites we believe that we created easily searchable sites with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods including restaurants nightlife history schools and other important facts 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 30  years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as location site and zoning information building characteristics space and unit availability tax assessments ownership sales and lease comparables space requirements number of retail stores number of listings mortgage and deed information forsale and forlease listings income and expense histories tenant names lease expirations contact information historical trends demographic information and retail sales per square foot the database also includes building photographs aerial photographs 3d virtual apartment tours plat maps and floor plans 

costar research

competition 

the market for information analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the market for information analytics and online marketplaces develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplaces our subscriptionbased information analytics and online marketplaces generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business including competitors that offer their services through rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

  

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers and to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together and how we can best address those uses through standalone services or combinations of coordinating applications thereof in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources in 2015 we launched the current apartmentscom and the apartmentfindercom websites both after completing extensive product development to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom we utilize a multichannel marketing campaign the launch of the sites andor the marketing campaign may not continue to increase brand awareness site traffic andor revenues if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the launch and marketing campaign which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced for example we continue to assess the impact of transitioning the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where all listings are paid and users can search the site for free we expect to see a shortterm reduction in revenues and earnings as well as reduced search engine optimization we are working to convert customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services which should increase revenues and earnings over time however we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be successful in shifting customers to higher value more profitable subscriptions and consequently in offsetting any reduction in revenues and earnings therefore our revenues and earnings may ultimately decline as a result of the loopnet conversion to a pure marketing site in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services if we are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or if our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services then there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to a decrease of our revenues and a reduction of our profitability 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a reversal of improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry may consolidate often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price further actions or inactions of the us or other major national governments may also impact economic conditions which could result in financial market disruptions or an economic downtown market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization including field sales personnel if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers our competition for advertisers may have significant brand recognition as well as greater numbers of direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do which may provide a competitive advantage to compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell and landsofamerica which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase and the landcom network of rural lands for sale we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing including sales and marketing for our other brands as we seek to grow the numbers of subscribers to and advertisers on our marketplaces our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on the apartmentscom network of rental websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites if search results do not feature our websites prominently traffic to our websites would decrease and our business could be adversely affected google bing yahoo and other internet search websites drive traffic to our websites including costarcom the apartmentscom network of rental websites loopnetcom bizbuysellcom and landsofamericacom for example when a user types an apartment building address into an internet search engine organic search ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed in the search results however our ability to maintain high organic search result rankings is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization or seo efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than the rankings our websites receive or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings each of which could slow the growth of our user base further search engine providers could align with our competitors which could adversely affect traffic to our websites our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace businesses depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites if we fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites our efforts to maintain or generate additional traffic to our marketplaces may not be successful even if we are able to attract additional users increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products we face competition to attract users to our marketplace websites our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to our own that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources if we are unable to increase traffic to our marketplaces or if we are unable to generate enough additional revenues to offset increases in expenses related to increasing traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase and the landcom network of rural lands for sale depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

 

further with respect to the apartmentscom network of rental websites our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

many of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have longterm contracts these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice in addition as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenues and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we do not invest in product development and provide services that are attractive to our users and to our advertisers our business could be adversely affected  our success depends on our continued improvements to provide services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to our advertisers as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies if we are unable to provide services that users want to use then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors’ websites if we are unable to continue offering innovative services we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products or services managing the integration of acquired infrastructure and controls potential increases in operating costs managing geographically remote operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential disruptions in ongoing operations during integration the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies external factors such as compliance with laws and regulations and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful integration of an acquired business an acquired business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain or may be denied and if obtained the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors or conditions quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations new services or other significant or strategic information general conditions in the commercial real estate industry general conditions of local national or global economies developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or directly from brokers through the listing manager feature on costar or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers advertisers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins over the past few years we have increased the rate of investments in our business including internal investments in product development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of investments furthermore our investments may not have their intended effect in addition our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which our services may be provided the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position 

we seek to enforce our rights against people and entities that infringe our intellectual property including through legal action taking such action may be costly and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

third party claims litigation or government investigations to which we are subject or in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various third party claims lawsuits or government investigations any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved whether as plaintiff or defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation in the marketplace our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we collect store and use biometric data sensitive or confidential transaction information and in certain circumstances credit card information in addition we collect personal information from tenants and landlords including social security numbers dates of birth financial information tax returns employment information background checks and credit scores which is used in the apartment rental application process and for the verification of landlords as a result we are subject to a variety of state national and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data including the fair credit reporting act laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations for example in 2016 the eu formally adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which will apply in all eu member states effective may 25 2018 and will replace the current eu data protection directive effective on that date the gdpr introduces new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new eu data protection rules any failure to comply with the rules arising from the eu data protection directive the gdpr and related national laws of eu member states could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us and could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations compliance with any of the foregoing laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new products a violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines against us 

we have undertaken efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the eea based on current regulatory obligations the guidance of data protection authorities and evolving best practices we continue to review our business practices and the evolving regulations and may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our personal data handling or engage in additional efforts to cause our transfer and receipt of eea residents’ personal data to be legitimized under applicable law as a result of the adoption of gdpr we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain euorigin data in the european economic area or eea which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means of transferring certain data from the eea which may vary the current data protection landscape 

our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable privacy or data security laws regulations and policies or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions and significant penalties against us which could result in negative publicity increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features 

of our products if so in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims and penalties we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products which could harm our business 

we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies we could be subject to legal claims government action harm to our reputation or experience significant remediation costs if we experience a security breach or our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

concern of prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites or collected when performing our services could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards for customer payments  we accept payments for our services through credit and debit card transactions for credit and debit card payments we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time an increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our cost of revenues either of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards cardholders and transactions if we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit cardrelated costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web product and development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 13 billion  of goodwill including 1 billion  in our north america operating segment and 30 million  in our international operating segment 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of property listings submitted by brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including bizbuysell and bizquest are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are used to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale our revenues could be negatively affected 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenues and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries including differing laws regarding privacy and data protection difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited property and portfolio research ltd grecam sas the assets of belbex corporate sl thomas daily as well as our expansion into canada a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound euro and canadian dollar as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results  on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the united kingdom provided its official notice to the european council that it intends to leave the european union commencing a period of up to two years for the uk and the other eu member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal uncertainty over the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu could cause political and economic uncertainty in the uk and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results in particular brexit could result in significant volatility in global equity markets currency exchange rates and other asset prices including those related to real property the impact to us from brexit will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations this impact may affect not only our uk operations but operations in other parts of the eu any transitional or permanent agreements resulting from such negotiations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 

a potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the us dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease or cancel orders or terminate or fail to renew subscriptions for our services 

we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars resulting asset price volatility that could follow the withdrawal of the uk from the eu may create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly in terms of compliance further brexit may lead other eu member countries to consider referendums regarding their eu membership any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

changes in laws regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could increase our cost of doing business in particular there may be significant changes in us laws and regulations by the current us presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses including our business the current us presidential administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies and recently adopted tax reform legislation refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k for additional discussion of the impact of tax reform on the business we cannot predict the impact if any of potential future additional changes to our business if the current us presidential administration materially modifies us laws and regulations or fiscal and other tax policies our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act and various provisions of the new law may adversely affect us certain aspects of tax reform are unclear and may not be clarified for some time as required by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the tax act in our consolidated financial statements however we may be required to change our provisional estimates as a result of new accounting guidance regulatory guidance judicial interpretations or our continued analysis of the application of the law which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in addition if federal state or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or issue new guidance our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

our indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs  on october 19 2017 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the ‘‘2017 credit agreement’’ which amended and restated in its entirety the existing credit agreement dated april 1 2014 the 2014 credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2017 credit agreement provides for a 750 million revolving credit facility with a term of five years from a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and issuing banks the 2017 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things i incur additional indebtedness ii create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv make investments and acquisitions v make certain dispositions of assets vi make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2017 credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the 2017 credit agreement if an event of default occurs the interest rate on overdue amounts will increase and the lenders under the 2017 credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the 2017 credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of 

auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2017  we held 11 million  par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2017  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2017  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 730000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2017  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events our users rely on our services when conducting their own businesses disruptions in or reductions in ability to access our services for whatever reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or result in reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and online marketplaces which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected  the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results in addition our results may be impacted by seasonality the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slowdowns during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company    on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov requires costar to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires costar to license its products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition costar is required to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions for which notification would not otherwise be required under the hartscottrodino premerger notification act this provision of the consent order requiring costar to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions could prevent us from closing certain acquisitions or add significant time and cost to these potential acquisitions ultimately making an acquisition prohibitive or preventing costar from realizing anticipated benefits of an acquisition in the event that costar fails or is unable to comply with the terms of the consent order costar could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief 

we have incurred and will continue to incur acquisitionrelated costs    we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate prior acquisitions such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline

subscriptionbased services 

our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of information analytics and online marketplace services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscriptionbased license agreements that renew automatically a majority of which have a term of one year upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage or number of paid clicks depending on the type of service contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the clients business focus geography the number and types of services to which a client subscribes the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a clients advertised properties in the search results our subscription clients generally pay contract fees in advance on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us in advance on a quarterly or annual basis 

 as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our annualized net bookings of subscriptionbased services on all contracts were approximately 43 million  and 29 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on all existing subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported our net bookings is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our subscription revenue results net bookings is considered a key indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of salesforce productivity by management and investors we recognize subscription revenues on a straightline basis over the life of the contract 

for each of the twelve months ended december 31 2017  and 2016  our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services on annual contracts was approximately 91  and 90  respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 9  and 10  respectively for the same time periods our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

development investments and expansion 

we are committed to supporting and improving our information news analytic and online marketplace solutions we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate and crosssell services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our listing sites we utilize a variety of marketing campaigns including television and radio advertising onlinedigital advertising social media and outofhome ads and search engine marketing we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing in 2018 as we continue to assess the success and effectiveness of our marketing campaign we will continue to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for our services for future periods 

our key priorities for 2018 and recent developments include 

• we are migrating all of our commercial real estate information capabilities to our flagship costar suite product and winding down the legacy loopnet information products this process began in the fall of 2017 with the integration of the costar and loopnet databases in addition we are transitioning the loopnet marketplace to a pure paytolist marketing site for commercial real estate we completed integrating the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases during the second half of 2017 the two services now share a unified database of information creating operating efficiencies and improving the data available to our customers we also introduced new enhancements on the costar homepage including a listing manager feature that we believe will increase the quantity and quality of the listing information available by enabling brokers and other industry participants to load information directly into the integrated system this in turn is expected to reduce the time and costs associated with researching and maintaining our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information 

• on february 21 2018 we completed the acquisition of forrent a division of dominion enterprises forrent’s primary service is digital advertising through a network of four multifamily websites  which includes forrentcom after55com corporatehousingcom and forrentuniversitycom we plan to integrate develop and crosssell the services offered by forrent forrentcom is expected to remain a distinct complementary brand to apartmentscom giving property managers and owners more exposure for their listings 

• we plan to continue developing new and improve existing product and service offerings to the apartments industry in particular we expect to implement the ability for renters to apply for leases online for landlords to run tenant credit and background checks and eventually for landlords and tenants to generate leases and process payments online 

• we continue to invest in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings we established our research operations headquarters in richmond virginia in december 2016 which is developing into a technology innovation hub powering the software development necessary to support the content within our information analytics and marketing services in connection with the opening of the richmond research headquarters we have expanded our research team to continue to meet the growing content needs of our clients in addition we expect to continue to invest in our international research operations in madrid spain and the uk 

in support of our continued expansion and development in october 2017 we completed a public equity offering of 3317308 shares of common stock for 26000 per share net proceeds from the public equity offering were approximately 834 million  after deducting approximately 29 million of underwriting discounts and fees we expect to use the net proceeds from the public equity offering to fund all or a portion of the costs of any strategic acquisitions we determine to pursue in the future to finance the growth of our business and for working capital and other general corporate purposes general corporate purposes may include additions to working capital capital expenditures repayment of debt investments in the company’s subsidiaries possible acquisitions and the repurchase redemption or retirement of securities including the company’s common stock 

on october 19 2017 the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the ‘‘2017 credit agreement’’ which amended and restated in its entirety the existing 2014 credit agreement the 2017 credit agreement provides for a 750 

million revolving credit facility with a term of five years from a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and issuing banks the company also paid off the remaining balance of 310 million and interest on its existing 400 million term loan under the 2014 credit agreement on october 19 2017 from existing cash balances the 2017 revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the company and its subsidiaries the company had no outstanding longterm debt at december 31 2017 as it had not drawn any amounts under its 2017 credit agreement the restructured credit facility along with the proceeds from the october equity offering and cash generated by the company’s business are expected to support the company’s continued growth and give the company flexibility to act on strategic acquisition opportunities that may arise 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to experience reduced revenues or generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future any development efforts must comply with our credit facility which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business 

property developments 

as we have done in the past we expect to continue to identify new facilities and consolidate existing facilities to better accommodate the changing demands of our business operations and employees as a result we may incur additional lease restructuring charges for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include net income before interest and other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share also referred to as “nongaap eps” ebitda is our net income before interest loss on debt extinguishment income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integration related costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integration related costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs and loss on debt extinguishment incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and online marketplace services which has included acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integration related costs restructuring costs and loss on debt extinguishment adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integration related costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integration related costs restructuring costs loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from ebitda to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 



high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stockbased awards therefore we believe it is useful to exclude stockbased compensation in order to better understand the longterm performance of our core business 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integration related costs restructuring and related costs settlement and impairment costs and loss on debt extinguishment incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2017  2016  and 2015  we assumed a 38 tax rate which approximates our historical longterm statutory corporate tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

the following table provides a comparison of our selected consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31 2017  and 2016  in thousands of dollars 



revenues  revenues increased  to 965 million  in 2017  from 838 million  in 2016  the 127 million   increase  was primarily attributable to increased revenues of approximately 55 million  or 13 from continued organic growth in costar suite as well as a movement of our loopnet customers onto our costar platform as a result of the loopnet integration information services decreased 5m or 6 primarily due to continued wind down of loopnet information products including premium searcher partially offset by increases in our real estate manager offering multifamily year over year increases of 55 million  or 24  was primarily attributable to organic growth as well as some smaller increases for several acquisitions commercial property and land revenue increased 22 million or 18 over 2016 primarily due to organic growth as well as an increase due to the landwatch acquisition overall revenue growth rates are expected to be in line or slightly higher than 2017 

gross profit  gross profit increased  to 745 million  in 2017  from 664 million  in 2016  the gross margin percentage decreased  to 77  in 2017  from 79  in 2016  revenue growth led to an increase  in costs of revenues of 38 million  for additional research personnel costs 5 million  in occupancy related costs from our new research office in richmond offset by a decrease in the amortization of intangible assets of 4 million  gross margins are impacted by the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired through acquisitions 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses increased  to 318 million  in 2017  from 296 million  in 2016  and decreased  as a percentage of revenues to 33  from 35  the increase  in the amount of selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to a 25 million  increase in sales personnel costs related to increased commission expense from higher sales in 2017 partially offset by a 2 million  decrease in digital marketing costs 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased  to 89 million  in 2017  from 76 million  in 2016  and remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues at 9  for both 2017  and 2016  the increase  in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to a 14 million  increase in personnel costs to support enhancements and upgrades to our services and integration of the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased   19  to 146 million  in 2017  from 123 million  in 2016  and remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues at 15  in 2017  and 2016  the increase  in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to legal costs related to litigation of approximately 13 million  an increase in administrative personnel costs of 5 million  to support the ongoing growth of the business and a 3 million  increase in charitable donations 

customer base amortization expense  customer base amortization expense decreased  to approximately 18 million  in 2017  from 23 million  in 2016  and decreased  as a percentage of revenues to 2  in 2017  compared to 3  in 2016  the decrease  in the amount and percentage of customer base amortization expense was primarily due to the accelerated amortization of acquired customer bases in 2016  as compared to 2017  

interest and other income  interest and other income increased  to approximately 4 million  in 2017  compared to approximately 2 million  in 2016  the increase was primarily due to increased short term investments on a larger cash balance in 2017 than in 2016 mainly due to net proceeds of 834 million  from the equity offering in october 2017 

interest and other expense  interest and other expense remained relatively consistent at 9 million  in 2017  compared to 10 million  in 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding debt in october 2017 in conjunction with the 2017 credit agreement offset by higher interest rates on outstanding debt in 2017 compared to 2016 

loss on extinguishment  the loss on extinguishment was due to the restatement and amendment of the 2014 credit agreement as the 2017 credit agreement which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately 4 million  

income tax expense  income tax expense decreased  to 42 million  in 2017  compared to 52 million  in 2016  without the effect of discrete items income tax expense would have increased by approximately 12 million  discrete items resulted in a reduction in tax expense of approximately 22 million including the revaluation of the deferred tax liability at the lower federal statutory tax rate resulting in a 7 million  benefit we also recognized approximately 8 million  benefit in net research and development tax benefits related to the periods 20132017 finally we recognized 7 million  benefit from the impact of the accounting rule change in asu 201609 that provided for recognizing excess tax benefits in income tax expense as compared to additional paid in capital which was the treatment prior to 2017

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

the following tables present our unaudited consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues these tables should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k the quarterly results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of quarterly results for any future period 





liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations total cash and cash equivalents increased  to 1 billion  at december 31 2017  compared to cash and cash equivalents of 567 million  at december 31 2016  the increase  in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily due to 834 million  in net proceeds from our public equity offering in october 2017 of 3317308 shares of common stock for 26000 per share after deducting underwriting discounts and fees of 29 million  in addition the company generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately 235 million  partially offset by debt payments of 345 million  purchase of property equipment and other assets of approximately 24 million  and payments made for acquisitions including landwatch westside rentals and the screening pros totaling approximately 48 million 

changes in cash and cash equivalents are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by issuance of shares to cover taxes 

net cash provided by  operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017  was 235 million  compared to 201 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  and 140 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  the 34 million  and 61 million   increase  from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  and from december 31 2015  to december 31 2016  respectively is primarily due to higher income from operations in both periods income from operations was partially offset fluctuations in working capital 

net cash used in  investing activities for the year ended december 31 2017  was 72 million  compared to 23 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  and 216 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  the 49 million   increase  in investing activities in 2017  compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase  in cash used for acquisitions from 2016  to 2017  2017 included cash payments for the acquisitions of westside rentals for 14 million  a 31 million  payment for landwatch and a 3 million  payment for the acquisition of the screening pros during 2017  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 24 million  primarily related to computer equipment and leasehold improvements for build out of sales office space we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2018  related to the build out of leased office space including the richmond research headquarters as well as investments in technology 

the 192 million decrease in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in cash used for acquisitions from 2015 to 2016 the 182 million of net cash used for acquisitions in 2015 included 179 million for the acquisition of apartment finder and certain assets related to the business operations of apartment finders independent distributors as well as 3 million for the acquisition of the assets of belbex corporate sl in 2016 we spent 10 million for the acquisitions of thomas daily and certain assets related to the business operations of apartment finders independent distributors during 2016 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 19 million primarily related to computer equipment and leasehold improvements for build out of sales office space 

net cash provided by  financing activities for the year ended december 31 2017  was 480 million  compared to net cash used in  financing activities of 31 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  and 29 million  in december 31 2015  this 511 million   increase  from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to 834 million  in net proceeds from our equity offering offset by an increase in debt repayments in 2017 of 325 million  

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we expect to continue to make acquisitions on january 31 2017 we acquired westside rentals on may 10 2017 we acquired landwatch and on july 18 2017 we acquired the screening pros on february 21 2018 we completed the acquisition of forrent a division of dominion enterprises for approximately 350 million in cash and approximately 35 million in costar group stock subject to customary working capital and other postclosing adjustments our future acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

on october 19 2017 the company entered into the ‘‘2017 credit agreement’’ which amended and restated in its entirety the existing 2014 credit agreement the 2017 credit agreement provides for a 750 million revolving credit facility with a term of five years from a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and issuing banks the company had not drawn on the 2017 credit agreement as of december 31 2017  

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2017  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a thirdparty or us or iii employment agreements amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of 134 million  due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 

goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually by each reporting unit the company may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or the company elects to bypass such assessment the company then determines the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2017  the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2017  that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the fee is fixed or determinable 3 services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned and 4 collectability is reasonably assured revenues from subscriptionbased services are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical collection experience changes in customer payment profiles and the aging of receivable balances as well as current economic conditions all of which may affect a customer’s ability to pay a credit reserve has also been established based on historical experience of credits issued to customers to ensure that revenue is recognized appropriately in the current period deferred revenue results from advance cash receipts from customers or amounts billed in advance to customers from the sale of subscription services and is recognized over the term of the service agreement 

we derive revenues by providing access to our proprietary database of commercial real estate information we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of information analytics and online marketplace services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals subscription contract rates are based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography the number and types of services to which a client subscribes the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a clients advertised properties in the search results as applicable a majority of the subscriptionbased service agreements have a term of one year and renew automatically 

we analyze contracts with multiple elements under the accounting guidance for multipleelement arrangements our multipleelement arrangements include information analytics andor online marketplace services that are generally provided to the customer over the same term when identifying multipleelement arrangements we consider multiple purchases made by the same customer within a short time frame and assess whether the purchases were negotiated together as one overall arrangement if a multipleelement arrangement is identified then the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices which is estimated considering factors such as historical pricing pricing strategy market conditions and other factors we account for each deliverable in the transaction separately if the deliverables cannot be separated into multiple units of accounting then the arrangement consideration is combined and recognition of revenues is determined for the combined unit of accounting multipleelement transactions require judgment to determine the selling price or fair value of the different elements the judgments impact the amount of revenues recognized over the term of the contract as well as the period in which they are recognized 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

we generally recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment changes in existing tax laws and rates their related interpretations and the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amounts of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuations of our deferred tax assets over time our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act we report provisional amounts if we are able to determine a reasonable estimate but do not have the necessary information available prepared and analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for tax reform  we may revise our estimates as we finalize our accounting during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment of tax reform

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option for equity instruments that vest based on a market condition we estimate the fair value of each equity instrument granted on the date of grant using a montecarlo simulation model which also requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the equity instruments these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of our stock price for equity instruments that vest based on performance we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability of whether the performance conditions would be met if our initial estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions change the related stockbased compensation expense and timing of recognition may fluctuate from period to period based on those estimates if the performance conditions are not met no stockbased compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized stockbased compensation expense will be reversed 

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2017  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customer bases acquired database technology and acquired trade names from a market participants perspective useful lives and discount rates during the measurement period we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities ars whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2017  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of contractual cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period 

the only significant unobservable input in the discounted cash flow model is the discount rate the discount rate used represents our estimate of the yield expected by a market participant from the ars investments the weighted average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2017  and 2016  was approximately 6 and 5  respectively selecting another discount rate within the range used in the discounted cash flow model would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the ars 

based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2017  we determined there was a net decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 730000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2017  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in march 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification of sharebased payment transactions on the statement of cash flows effective the first quarter of 2017 the company adopted the standard which impacted our 2017 net income because excess tax benefits which were previously reflected in additional paid in capital are now reflected in income tax expense the significance of the impact will depend on the intrinsic value at the time of vesting or exercise of equity instruments 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which is designed to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test the guidance indicates that an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 the company early adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2017 and the early adoption did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

we had approximately 15 billion  in intangible assets as of december 31 2017  as of december 31 2017  we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable however changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

development and expansion 

we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate and crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our information news analytic and online marketplace solutions 

the launch of the apartmentscom website and the apartmentfindercom website in 2015 are examples of our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services and integrate and crosssell existing services we believe the improved sites enhanced search capabilities availability of information regarding realtime vacancies and our continued development and introduction of enhancements to our online apartment rental marketplaces have attracted more consumers making the sites more attractive to property managers which has also increased our crossselling opportunities in addition we recently launched apartamentoscom an apartmentlisting site offered exclusively in spanish built and tailored to meet the needs of spanish language households in the us which is believed to represent approximately 20 percent of the us renter population we believe greater functionality makes our services valuable to an even broader audience and helps us increase sales of our services to brokers banks owners institutional investors and other industry participants we expect technology enhancements to drive continued revenue growth in 2017 and the foreseeable future 

in 2016 we began working to further integrate the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases so that the two services will share a unified database of information in order to create operating efficiencies and improve the data available to our customers we also hope to increase the quantity and quality of the listing information available by enabling select brokers and other industry participants to load information directly into the integrated system simultaneously reducing the time and costs associated with researching and maintaining our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information 

we evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs further in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs we may decide to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that among other things overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer in the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings we may experience reduced revenues and earnings the decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services we continue to assess the timing and potential impact of transitioning the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free when we implement this shift we will seek to convert loopnet information customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services which should increase revenues and earnings over time however we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings if any resulting from the elimination or phasing out of the loopnet information services or any other service offering if implemented 

our revenues have increased as a result of revenues from acquired businesses and from crossselling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies we expect to continue to increase revenues as a result of such crossselling opportunities we may incur increased expenses in connection with any marketing and sales campaigns involving crossselling opportunities and initiatives and in connection with promotion of our new services and brands 

we are expanding the geographic reach of our north america services in 2014 we began offering our services in toronto canada building on our experience in toronto we have expanded and are continuing to expand our research into additional canadian cities in the second quarter of 2015 we began offering services in calgary and vancouver in the second quarter of 2016 we began offering services in ottawa and in the third quarter of 2016 we began offering services in edmonton on july 1 2015 we expanded our international services into madrid spain through the acquisition of the assets of belbex a small commercial real estate information provider operating in madrid spain further on may 3 2016 we expanded our international services into key markets in germany through the acquisition of thomas daily a commercial real estate news and information provider operating in freiburg germany we believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services including expansion of our existing service offerings have created a platform for longterm revenue growth we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscriptionbased services and the successful crossselling of our services to customers in existing markets 

we have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company and our service offerings in north america and internationally we plan to continue to invest in evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the company continues to develop and grow we are also investing in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to support the apartmentscom network to expand into additional canadian markets and to provide services in madrid spain and key markets in germany we recently established our research operations headquarters in richmond virginia and plan to expand our research team and continue investing in research operations to meet the growing content needs of our clients while we believe investments we make in our business create a platform for growth those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research and sales and marketing organizations we are committed to continuing to support and improve our information analytics and online marketplace solutions 

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database researchers and outside contractors our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

within the apartment rental community most apartment listing websites primarily supply only the listings that property owners pay to advertise and often return results that are inconsistent with the renters search criteria these limited results generally do not provide information about the actual rental availabilities we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information to create the apartmentscom apartmentfindercom and apartamentoscom websites we drew on our multifamily database and undertook a research effort collecting and verifying information and visiting and photographing properties with the apartmentscom apartmentfindercom and apartamentoscom websites we believe that we created easily searchable sites with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods including restaurants nightlife history schools and other important facts 

costar’s comprehensive database

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2016  our full time researchers and contractors conducted millions of interviews of brokers owners tenants apartment community owners and property managers we recently established our research operations headquarters in richmond virginia we expect the richmond research headquarters will be a technology innovation hub powering the software development necessary to support the content within our information analytics and marketing services

our researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers

data and image providers  we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps aerial photographs and 3d virtual apartment tours of apartment communities all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and online marketplaces and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems  our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

competition 

the market for information analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the market for information analytics and online marketplaces develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplaces our subscriptionbased information analytics and online marketplaces generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business including competitors that offer their services through rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

  

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers and to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together and how we can best address those uses through standalone services or combinations of coordinating applications thereof in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources in 2015 we launched the current apartmentscom and the apartmentfindercom websites both after completing extensive product development to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom we utilize a multichannel marketing campaign the launch of the sites andor the marketing campaign may not continue to increase brand awareness site traffic andor revenues if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the launch and marketing campaign which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced for example we continue to assess the timing and potential impact of transitioning the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free we expect to see a shortterm reduction in revenues and earnings as well as reduced search engine optimization when we implement this transition although we continue to assess the timing and best strategy to implement this shift and plan to seek to convert customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services which should increase revenues and earnings over time we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be successful in shifting customers to higher value more profitable subscriptions and consequently in offsetting any reduction in revenues and earnings therefore when we make this transition our revenues and earnings may ultimately decline in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services if we are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or if our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services then there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to a decrease of our revenues and a reduction of our profitability 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a reversal of improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry may consolidate often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price further actions or inactions of the us or other major national governments may also impact economic conditions which could result in financial market disruptions or an economic downtown market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization including field sales personnel if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers our competition for advertisers may have significant brand recognition as well as greater numbers of direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do which may provide a competitive advantage to compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell and landsofamerica which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing including sales and marketing for our other brands as we seek to grow the numbers of subscribers to and advertisers on our marketplaces our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on the apartmentscom network of rental websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites if search results do not feature our websites prominently traffic to our websites would decrease and our business could be adversely affected google bing yahoo and other internet search websites drive traffic to our websites including costarcom the apartmentscom network of rental websites loopnetcom bizbuysellcom and landsofamericacom for example when a user types an apartment building address into an internet search engine organic search ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed in the search results however our ability to maintain high organic search result rankings is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization or seo efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than the rankings our websites receive or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings each of which could slow the growth of our user base further search engine providers could align with our competitors which could adversely affect traffic to our websites our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace businesses depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites if we fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites our efforts to maintain or generate additional traffic to our marketplaces may not be successful even if we are able to attract additional users increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products we face competition to attract users to our marketplace websites our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to our own that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources if we are unable to increase traffic to our marketplaces or if we are unable to generate enough additional revenues to offset increases in expenses related to increasing traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

 

further with respect to the apartmentscom network of rental websites our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

many of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have longterm contracts these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice in addition as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenues and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we do not invest in product development and provide services that are attractive to our users and to our advertisers our business could be adversely affected  our success depends on our continued improvements to provide services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to our advertisers as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies if we are unable to provide services that users want to use then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors’ websites if we are unable to continue offering innovative services we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are not able to successfully finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products or services potential increases in operating costs managing geographically remote operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential disruptions in ongoing operations during integration the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain and the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors or conditions quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations new services or other significant or strategic information general conditions in the commercial real estate industry general conditions of local national or global economies developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers advertisers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins over the past few years we have increased the rate of investments in our business including internal investments in product development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of investments furthermore our investments may not have their intended effect in addition our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which our services may be provided the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position 

we seek to enforce our rights against people and entities that infringe our intellectual property including through legal action taking such action may be costly and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved whether as plaintiff or defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation in the marketplace our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we collect store and use sensitive or confidential transaction information and in certain circumstances credit card information in addition we collect personal information from tenants and landlords including social security numbers dates of birth financial information tax returns employment information background checks and credit scores which is used in the apartment rental application process and for verification of landlords as a result we are subject to a variety of state national and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data including the fair credit reporting act these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new products a violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines against us 

the useu safe harbor framework which established means for legitimizing the transfer of personal data by us companies from the european economic area or eea to the us recently was invalidated by a decision of the european court of justice or the ecj in light of the ecj’s decision we have undertaken efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the eea based on current regulatory obligations the guidance of data protection authorities and evolving best practices we continue to review our business practices and the evolving regulations and may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our personal data handling or engage in additional efforts to cause our transfer and receipt of eea residents’ personal data to be legitimized under applicable european law we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain euorigin data in the european economic area which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means of transferring certain data from the eea including due to ongoing legislative activity which may vary the current data protection landscape 

our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable privacy or data security laws regulations and policies or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions and significant penalties against us which could result in negative publicity increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products if so in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims and penalties we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products which could harm our business 

we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of personally identifiable of information are described on our websites while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies we could be subject to legal claims government action harm to our reputation or experience significant remediation costs if we experience a security breach or our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

concern of prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards for customer payments  we accept payments for our services through credit and debit card transactions for credit and debit card payments we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time an increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our cost of revenues either of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards cardholders and transactions if we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit cardrelated costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web product and development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 1 billion  of goodwill including 1 billion  in our north america operating segment and 27 million  in our international operating segment 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of property listings submitted by brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including bizbuysell and bizquest are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are used to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale our revenues could be negatively affected 

the number of loopnets registered members is higher than the number of actual members the number of registered members in loopnets network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations or others may have registered under fictitious names given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members and thus we rely on the number of registered members as a measure of the size of the loopnet marketplace if the number of loopnets actual members does not continue to grow and those members do not convert to premium members then the loopnet marketplace business may not grow as fast as we expect which could harm our operating and financial results 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenues and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited property and portfolio research ltd grecam sas the assets of belbex corporate sl thomas daily as well as our expansion into canada a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound euro and canadian dollar as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

the economic effects of “brexit” may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results  on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the referendum is nonbinding however if passed into law negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu the impact to us from brexit will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations this impact may affect not only our uk operations but operations in other parts of the eu any transitional or permanent agreements resulting from such negotiations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 

as a result of the referendum the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar a potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the us dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease or cancel orders or terminate or fail to renew subscriptions for our services 

volatility in exchange rates resulting from brexit is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening dollar our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

the announcement of brexit and the withdrawal of the uk from the eu may create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly in terms of compliance further brexit may lead other eu member countries to consider referendums regarding their eu membership any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

changes in laws regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could increase our cost of doing business in particular there may be significant changes in us laws and regulations by the new us presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses including our business the new us presidential administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies which may include comprehensive tax reform we cannot predict the impact if any of these changes to our business if the new us presidential administration materially modifies us laws and regulations or fiscal and tax policies our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs  on april 1 2014 we entered into the 2014 credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2014 credit agreement provides for a 400 million term loan facility and a 225 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years we used the proceeds of the term loan facility and 150 million of the initial borrowing under the revolving credit facility to refinance the term loan facility and revolving credit facility established under a credit agreement dated february 16 2012 the “2012 credit agreement” including related fees and expenses and pay a portion of the consideration and transaction costs related to the apartmentscom acquisition the 2014 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to i incur additional indebtedness ii create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv make investments and acquisitions v make certain dispositions of assets vi make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2014 credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the 2014 credit agreement if an event of default occurs the interest rate on overdue amounts will increase and the lenders under the 2014 credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the 2014 credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2016  we held 11 million  par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2016  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2016  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 848000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2016  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events our users rely on our services when conducting their own businesses disruptions in or reductions in ability to access our services for whatever reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or result in reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and online marketplaces which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected  the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results in addition our results may be impacted by seasonality the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slowdowns during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company    on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov requires costar to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires costar to maintain its customary practice of selling its products separately and on a marketbymarket basis it also requires costar to license its products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition costar is required to maintain its customary licensing practices with respect to the length of its contracts to allow customers with multiyear contracts to cancel with one years advance notice and to agree to reduce the cost of any litigation with customers by offering to arbitrate certain disputes in the event that costar fails or is unable to comply with the terms of the consent order costar could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief further the provisions of the consent order may result in unanticipated adverse effects on the combined company and therefore reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger for example the terms of the consent order that require us to continue to sell our products separately may prohibit us from combining or eliminating certain business lines products or services that we believe would result in a longterm positive impact on our revenues and earnings 

we have incurred and will continue to incur acquisitionrelated costs    we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate prior acquisitions such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options

subscriptionbased services 

our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of information analytics and online marketplace services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscriptionbased license agreements that renew automatically a majority of which have a term of one year upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage or number of paid clicks depending on the type of service contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the clients business focus geography the number and types of services to which a client subscribes the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a clients advertised properties in the search results our subscription clients generally pay contract fees in advance on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us in advance on a quarterly or annual basis 

as of december 31 2015  and 2016  our annualized net new sales of subscriptionbased services on annual contracts were approximately 29 million  and 27 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from new annual subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on existing annual subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported this decrease is primarily due to i a shift in the mix of contract terms for the apartments network services from a term of one year to a term of less than one year and ii discontinuation of sales and marketing efforts for the loopnet information products ahead of the integration with costar suite as of december 31 2015  and 2016  our annualized net bookings of subscriptionbased services on all contracts were approximately 25 million  and 29 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on all existing subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported we recognize subscription revenues on a straightline basis over the life of the contract 

for each of the twelve months ended december 31 2015  and 2016  our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services on annual contracts was approximately 90  and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 10  for the same time periods our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

development and expansion 

we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate and crosssell services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our information news analytic and online marketplace solutions 

some key priorities for 2017 include 

• we are working to further integrate the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases so that the two services will share a unified database of information in order to create operating efficiencies and improve the data available to our customers we also hope to increase the quantity and quality of the listing information available by enabling select brokers and other industry participants to load information directly into the integrated system simultaneously reducing the time and costs associated with researching and maintaining our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information we continue to assess the timing and potential impact of transitioning the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free we will seek to convert loopnet information customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services however through the transition there may be some reductions in revenues and earnings resulting from the elimination or phase out of the loopnet information service offerings 

• we are also investing in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings we recently established our research operations headquarters in richmond virginia which is expected to be a technology innovation hub powering the software development necessary to support the content within our information analytics and marketing services in connection with the opening of the richmond research headquarters we plan to expand the research team to continue our investment in research operations to meet the growing content needs of our clients in addition we expect continued investment in our international research operations in madrid spain and the uk 

• we recently launched apartamentoscom an apartmentlisting site offered exclusively in spanish built and tailored to meet the needs of spanish language households in the us we expect an increase in traffic for the network of apartment marketing sites and as well as a slight increase in costs to support this site and 

• on january 31 2017 we added westsiderentalscom to our network of apartment marketing sites through our acquisitions of koa lei inc doing business as westside rentals and now known as westside rentals llc and westside credit services llc westsiderentalscom is a rental website specializing in southern california real estate rentals as we transition from the current renterpaid subscription revenue model to an advertising model we expect to incur losses associated with this business integration 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to experience reduced revenues or generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future any development efforts must comply with our credit facility which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business 

property developments 

as in the past we expect to continue to identify new facilities and consolidate existing facilities to better accommodate the changing demands of our business and employees as a result we may incur additional lease restructuring charges for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include net income loss before interest and other income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share also referred to as “nongaap eps” ebitda is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income loss in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 29 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and online marketplace services which has included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs and restructuring costs adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from ebitda to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2014  2015  and 2016  we assumed a 38 tax rate in order to approximate our longterm effective corporate tax rate 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income loss per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

revenues  revenues increased  to 838 million  in 2016  from 712 million  in 2015  the 126 million   increase  was primarily attributable to increased revenues of approximately 64 million  from our apartments network primarily related to the acquisition of apartment finder on june 1 2015 as well as continued organic growth in costar suite and multifamily revenues the 2017 revenue growth rates from our costar suite and commercial property and land services are expected to be consistent with historical rates the revenue growth rate from information services is expected to decline in 2017 resulting from the elimination or phase out of the loopnet information services as we begin to convert loopnet information customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services multifamily revenue is expected to continue to increase in 2017 although at lower growth rates than in 2016 given the timing impact of the apartment finder acquisition 

gross margin  gross margin increased  to 664 million  in 2016  from 523 million  in 2015  the gross margin percentage increased  to 79  in 2016  from 73  in 2015  the increase  in the gross margin amount and percentage was principally due to an increase  in revenues as well as a decrease  in cost of revenues of 15 million  the decrease  in costs of revenues is primarily due to a 7 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets and a 6 million decrease in research personnel costs the gross margin percentage is expected to decrease slightly in 2017 as a result of our continued investment in research operations 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses decreased  to 296 million  in 2016  from 302 million  in 2015  and decreased  as a percentage of revenues to 35  in 2016  from 42  in 2015  the decrease  in the amount and percentage of selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to a 19 million decrease in marketing expense for the widescale marketing campaign to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom partially offset by a 14 million increase in sales personnel costs 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased  to 76 million  in 2016  from 66 million  in 2015  and remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues at 9  in 2016  and 2015  the increase  in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs to support enhancements and upgrades to our services and continued work to integrate the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased  to 123 million  in 2016  from 116 million  in 2015  and decreased  as a percentage of revenues to 15  in 2016  from 16  in 2015  the increase  in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to legal costs related to litigation of approximately 6 million incurred during 2016 that did not occur during 2015 as well as an increase in lease restructuring charges of 2 million for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements in 2016  compared to 2015  we expect to continue to incur legal costs related to a legal matter which began in 2016 that is expected to continue throughout 2017 

customer base amortization expense  customer base amortization expense decreased  to approximately 23 million  in 2016  from 28 million  in 2015  and decreased  as a percentage of revenues to 3  in 2016  compared to 4  in 2015  the decrease  in the amount and percentage of customer base amortization expense was primarily due to the accelerated amortization of acquired customer bases in 2015  as compared to 2016  

interest and other income  interest and other income increased  to approximately 2 million  in 2016  compared to approximately 537000  in 2015  the increase  was primarily due to a realized gain of approximately 808000  on investments in auction rate securities “ars” in 2016  that did not occur in 2015  

interest and other expense  interest and other expense remained relatively consistent at 10 million  in 2016  compared to 9 million  in 2015  

income tax expense net  income tax expense net increased  to 52 million  in 2016  compared to 6 million  in 2015  this increase  was primarily due to higher income before income taxes in 2016  as compared to 2015  as a result of our increased revenues 

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2016  and year ended december 31 2015   

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being north america which includes the us and canada and international which includes the uk spain germany and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenues and operating segment ebitda which is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment   revenues  north america revenues increased  to 809 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 687 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  this increase  in north america revenues was primarily due to increased revenues of approximately 64 million  from our apartments network as well as the further penetration of our subscriptionbased services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates international revenues increased  to 28 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 25 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  this increase  was primarily due to further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services resulting from sales of costar suite 

segment ebitda  north america ebitda increased  to 211 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 87 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  the increase  in north america ebitda was due primarily to an increase in revenues international ebitda increased  to 4 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 3 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  this increase  in international ebitda was primarily due to an increase in revenues international ebitda is expected to decrease in 2017 primarily due to investments in our international research operations in madrid spain and the uk north america ebitda includes an allocation of approximately 396000  and 1 million  for the years ended 2016  and 2015  respectively this allocation represents costs incurred for international employees involved in development activities of our north america operating segment international ebitda includes a corporate allocation of approximately 321000  and 256000  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively this corporate allocation represents costs incurred for north america employees involved in management and expansion activities of our international operating segment see the “nongaap financial measures” section included in this annual report on form 10k for further details on the nongaap financial measures 

comparison of year ended december 31 2015 and year ended december 31 2014 

the following table provides a comparison of our selected consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31 2015  and 2014  in thousands of dollars 



revenues  revenues increased to 712 million in 2015 from 576 million in 2014 the 136 million increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues of approximately 84 million from our apartments network as well as the further penetration of our subscriptionbased services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates 

gross margin  gross margin increased to 523 million in 2015 from 419 million in 2014 the gross margin percentage increased to 73 in 2015 from 73 in 2014 the increase in the gross margin amount and percentage was principally due to an increase in revenue partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues of 32 million the increase in costs of revenues is primarily due to the additional cost of revenues from our june 1 2015 acquisition of apartment finder 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses increased to 302 million in 2015 from 150 million in 2014 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 42 in 2015 from 26 in 2014 the increase in the amount and percentage of selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to a widescale marketing campaign that began during the first quarter of 2015 and continued to run through the remainder of 2015 to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased to 66 million in 2015 from 55 million in 2014 and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9 in 2015 from 10 in 2014 the increase in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs to support enhancements and upgrades to our services 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased to 116 million in 2015 from 104 million in 2014 and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 16 in 2015 from 18 in 2014 the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional general and administrative expenses of 16 million from apartment finder and apartmentscom these increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by loss contingencies and other legal costs related to litigation of approximately 3 million incurred during 2014 that did not occur during 2015 as well as a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs of approximately 479000 in 2015 compared to 2014 

customer base amortization expense  customer base amortization expense decreased to approximately 28 million in 2015 from 28 million in 2014 and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 4 in 2015 compared to 5 in 2014 the decrease in the amount and percentage of customer base amortization expense was primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense from loopnet of 2 million due to the accelerated amortization of the loopnet acquired customer base in 2014 partially offset by an increase in customer base amortization expenses of 2 million from apartment finder and apartmentscom in 2015 

interest and other income  interest and other income increased to approximately 537000 in 2015 compared to approximately 516000 in 2014 the increase was primarily due to our higher average cash and cash equivalent balance in 2015 resulting from the public equity offering we completed in june 2014 

interest and other expense  interest and other expense decreased to 9 million in 2015 compared to 10 million in 2014 the decrease was due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from a lower outstanding longterm debt balance during 2015 compared to 2014 

income tax expense net  income tax expense net decreased to 6 million in 2015 compared to 26 million in 2014 this decrease was primarily due to lower income before income taxes in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of our widescale marketing campaign that began during the first quarter of 2015 to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

the following tables present our unaudited consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues these tables should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k the quarterly results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of quarterly results for any future period 





liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and debt from our term loan and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents increased  to 567 million  at december 31 2016  compared to cash and cash equivalents of 422 million  at december 31 2015  the increase  in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately 196 million  partially offset by payments of longterm debt of 20 million  and purchase of property equipment and other assets of approximately 19 million  

changes in cash and cash equivalents are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable various accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises and similar events 

net cash provided by  operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 196 million  compared to 131 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  the 65 million   increase  in net cash provided by  operating activities is primarily due to an increase  of approximately 104 million  from net income plus noncash items partially offset by a net decrease  of approximately 39 million  in changes in operating assets and liabilities the 39 million   net decrease  in changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable related to our growth as well as differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements additionally there was a decrease in the change in deferred revenue finally there was a decrease in the change in noncurrent income taxes payable related to a tax method change for the treatment of bonus deductions 

net cash used in  investing activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 23 million  compared to 216 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  this 193 million   decrease  in investing activities in 2016  was primarily due to the decrease  in cash used for acquisitions from 2015  to 2016  the 182 million  of net cash used for acquisitions in 2015  resulted from 179 million  for the acquisition of apartment finder and certain assets related to the business operations of apartment finders independent distributors as well as 3 million  for the acquisition of the assets of belbex corporate sl the 10 million  of net cash used in acquisitions in 2016  resulted from 10 million  for the acquisitions of thomas daily and certain assets related to the business operations of apartment finders independent distributors during 2016  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 19 million  primarily related to computer equipment and leasehold improvements for build out of sales office space we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2017  related to the build out of leased office space including the richmond research headquarters as well as investments in technology 

net cash used in  financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 26 million  compared to 21 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  this 5 million   increase  in cash used in  financing activities was primarily due to a 4 million decrease in the amount of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised and restricted stock awards vested during 2016  as compared to 2015  

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we expect to continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

the term loan facility is available to us under a credit agreement dated april 1 2014 the 2014 credit agreement and provides for a 400 million term loan facility and a 225 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years the revolving credit facility had 225 million available as of december 31 2016  the undrawn proceeds of the revolving credit facility are available for our working capital needs and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2016  maturities of our borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement for each of the next three years ended december 31 2017 to 2019 are expected to be 35 million  55 million  and 255 million  respectively on april 29 2016 we prepaid the principal payments for our term loan facility due over the next three quarters for an aggregate prepayment amount of 15 million we were in compliance with the covenants in the 2014 credit agreement as of december 31 2016  

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2016  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 longterm debt obligations include scheduled principal payments and exclude interest payments which are based on a variable rate of interest as defined in the credit agreement 

2 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a thirdparty or us or iii employment agreements amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of 07 million  due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation as of october 1 2016  that revenues will continue to increase as a result of further penetration of our international subscriptionbased services including into madrid spain and freiburg germany and the successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2016  the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2016  that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform a quantitative impairment test we estimate the fair value of our existing indefinitelived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate revenue growth rate and royalty rate assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the revenue growth rate are based on our forecasts business plans and economic projections assumptions about the royalty rate are based on royalty agreements for comparable companies with similar intangible assets 

during the first quarter of 2016 we determined that the acquired trade names recorded in connection with the loopnet acquisition on april 30 2012 should be reclassified from an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset due to work being performed to integrate the backend systems of loopnet and costar which may result in a future rebranding effort if aspects of the two services are ultimately combined we estimated the fair value of the loopnet trade names using the relief from royalty method and concluded that no impairment existed as of march 31 2016 we estimated a useful life of fifteen years for the loopnet trade names which are being amortized on a straightline basis 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the fee is fixed and determinable 3 services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned and 4 collectability is reasonably assured revenues from subscriptionbased services are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement deferred revenue results from advance cash receipts from customers or amounts billed in advance to customers from the sale of subscription licenses and is recognized over the term of the license agreement 

we derive revenues by providing access to our proprietary database of commercial real estate information we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of information analytics and online marketplace services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals subscription contract rates are based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography the number and types of services to which a client subscribes the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a clients advertised properties in the search results a majority of the subscriptionbased license agreements have a term of one year and renew automatically 

we analyze contracts with multiple elements under the accounting guidance for multipleelement arrangements our multipleelement arrangements include information analytics andor online marketplace services that are generally provided to the customer over the same term when identifying multipleelement arrangements we consider multiple purchases made by the same customer within a short time frame and assess whether the purchases were negotiated together as one overall arrangement if a multipleelement arrangement is identified then the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices which is estimated considering factors such as historical pricing pricing strategy market conditions and other factors we account for each deliverable in the transaction separately if the deliverables cannot be separated into multiple units of accounting then the arrangement consideration is combined and recognition of revenues is determined for the combined unit of accounting multipleelement transactions require judgment to determine the selling price or fair value of the different elements the judgments impact the amount of revenues recognized over the term of the contract as well as the period in which they are recognized 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option for equity instruments that vest based on a market condition we estimate the fair value of each equity instrument granted on the date of grant using a montecarlo simulation model which also requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the equity instruments these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of our stock price for equity instruments that vest based on performance we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability of whether the performance conditions would be met if our initial estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions change the related stockbased compensation expense and timing of recognition may fluctuate from period to period based on those estimates if the performance conditions are not met no stockbased compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized stockbased compensation expense will be reversed 

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2016  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customer bases acquired database technology and acquired trade names from a market participants perspective useful lives and discount rates during the measurement period we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of ars whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2016  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of contractual cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period 

the only significant unobservable input in the discounted cash flow model is the discount rate the discount rate used represents our estimate of the yield expected by a market participant from the ars investments the weighted average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2015  and 2016  was approximately 5  selecting another discount rate within the range used in the discounted cash flow model would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the ars 

based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2016  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 848000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2016  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” and international accounting standards board “iasb” jointly issued a new revenue recognition standard that is designed to improve financial reporting by creating common recognition guidance for gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance and although we expect significant changes to our financial statement disclosures due to the nature of our services and current revenue recognition practices we do not believe the new revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our revenue recognition policies we expect adoption of the new standard will change our current treatment of commissions paid to employees which we currently expense as incurred under the new standard we expect to capitalize commission costs as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract which may have a material impact on our financial statements we are currently evaluating the period over which the capitalized commission costs will be amortized we are still assessing the financial statement impact of capitalizing commission costs and as a result we have not yet selected a transition method but we expect to adopt the new standard on january 1 2018 

in february 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to increase transparency and comparability among organizations’ accounting for leases the guidance requires a company to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet as well as disclose key information about leasing arrangements we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures but expect that the adoption of this standard may result in a material increase in assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

in march 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification of sharebased payment transactions on the statement of cash flows we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures but expect that the adoption of this standard will impact  our net income because excess tax benefits which are currently reflected in additional paid in capital will be reflected in income tax expense the significance of the impact will depend on the intrinsic value at the time of vesting or exercise of equity instruments t he adoption of this standard will also impact our c onsolidated statements of cash flows as excess tax benefits will be presented as an operating activity instead of a financing activity finally we plan to continue to estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust the estimate when it is no longer probable that the service or performance conditions will be met 

in june 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance designed to provide financial statement users with more information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures 

in august 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance designed to reduce the existing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures 

in january 2017 the fasb issued authoritative guidance designed to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

in january 2017 the fasb issued authoritative guidance designed to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

development and expansion 

we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research and sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our information news analytic and online marketplace solutions 

the launch of the improved apartmentscom website in february 2015 and the new apartmentfindercom website in december 2015 are examples of our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services and crosssell existing services we believe the improved sites enhanced search capabilities availability of information regarding realtime vacancies and our continued development and introduction of enhancements to our online apartment rental marketplaces will attract more consumers making these sites more attractive to property managers which will increase our crossselling opportunities our software development initiatives in 2015 included enhancing our new costar lease analysis ®  integrated workflow tool to provide users a simple way to produce understandable cash flows for leases and to enhance other lease comparable services we believe greater functionality makes our services valuable to an even broader audience and helps us increase sales of our services to brokers banks owners and institutional investors we expect technology enhancements to drive continued revenue growth in 2016 and for the foreseeable future 

we evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs further in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs we may decide to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that among other things overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer in the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings we may experience reduced revenues and earnings the decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services for example we recently eliminated certain apartment finder services and phased out apartment finder print advertising and moved to an alldigital offering we expect a shortterm reduction in revenues and associated costs resulting from the elimination of these apartment finder services additionally we are working to integrate the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases so that the two services will share a unified database of information in order to create efficiencies in operations and improved data for our customers we also continue to assess whether to transition the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free if and when we implement such a shift we will seek to convert loopnet marketplace customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services which should increase revenues and earnings over time however we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings if any resulting from any eliminations or phasing out of the loopnet information services or any other service offering if implemented 

our revenues have increased as a result of revenue from acquired businesses and from crossselling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies we expect to continue to increase revenues as a result of such crossselling opportunities we may incur increased expenses in connection with any marketing and sales campaigns involving crossselling opportunities and initiatives and in connection with promotion of our new services and brands 

we are expanding the geographic reach of our north america services in 2014 we began offering our services in toronto canada building on our experience in toronto we have expanded and are continuing to expand our research into additional canadian cities in the second quarter of 2015 we began offering services in calgary and vancouver and are currently researching commercial real estate in the canadian cities of ottawa and edmonton further on july 1 2015 we expanded our international services into madrid through the acquisition of the assets of belbex corporate sl a small commercial real estate information provider operating in madrid spain we believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services including expansion of our existing service offerings have created a platform for longterm revenue growth we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscriptionbased services and the successful crossselling of our services to customers in existing markets 

we have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company in north america and internationally we plan to continue to invest in evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the company continues to develop and grow we are also investing in our research capacity to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to support apartmentscom and apartment finder to expand into additional canadian markets and to provide services in madrid spain while we believe investments we make in our business create a platform for growth those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform expand the reach of our current service offerings or to integrate new or current offerings to provide a more robust efficient or complete service offering any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or internal expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research and sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our information analytics and online marketplace solutions 

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database researchers and outside contractors our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

within the apartment rental community most apartment websites primarily supply only the listings that property owners pay to advertise and often return results that are inconsistent with the renters search criteria these limited results generally do not provide information about the actual rental availabilities we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information to create the apartmentscom website and the apartmentfindercom website we have drawn on our multifamily database and undertaken a research effort collecting and verifying information and visiting and photographing properties with the launch of the improved apartmentscom website and the new apartmentfindercom website we believe that we have created easily searchable sites with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods including restaurants nightlife history schools and other important facts 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 28  years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as location site and zoning information building characteristics space and unit availability tax assessments ownership sales and lease comparables space requirements number of retail stores number of listings mortgage and deed information forsale and forlease listings income and expense histories tenant names lease expirations contact information historical trends demographic information and retail sales per square foot the database also includes building photographs aerial photographs 3d virtual apartment tours plat maps and floor plans 

costar research 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2015  our full time researchers and contractors conducted millions of interviews of brokers owners tenants apartment community owners and property managers 

research department  our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails and internet updates each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail we have also set up direct feeds from larger apartment sites and have put in place an automated system that compiles information sourced from the internet in order to provide the most uptodate information on rental availabilities 

our researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers 

costar has an extensive field research effort that includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional property inventory photograph properties and verify existing information in 2015  our field researchers drove millions of miles and conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections costars field research effort also includes creating high quality videos of interior spaces including walkthrough videos and 3d virtual apartment tours of apartment communities amenities and exterior features of properties costar utilizes hightech field research vehicles across the us canada and the uk a significant majority of these vehicles are customized energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for sale” or “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties collecting tenant data suite by suite we also utilize a lowflying airplane to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate we place researchers on the lowflying aircraft to scout additional commercial developments and take aerial photographs 

data and image providers  we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps aerial photographs and 3d virtual apartment tours of apartment communities all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and online marketplaces and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems  our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include 

 

finally one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day

we seek to make our services essential to our clients’ businesses to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased information services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates for subscriptionbased services are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography the number and types of services to which a client subscribes the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a clients advertised properties in the search results our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis

competition 

the market for information analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the market for information analytics and online marketplaces develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplaces our subscriptionbased information analytics and online marketplaces generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business including competitors that offer their services through rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

  

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a reversal of improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry may consolidate often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers our competitors for advertisers may have significant brand recognition as well as greater numbers of direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do which may provide a competitive advantage to compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet apartmentscom apartment finder bizbuysell and landsofamerica which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing including sales and marketing for our other brands as we seek to grow the numbers of subscribers to and advertisers on our marketplaces our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective our recent investments in sales and marketing activities to increase brand awareness and grow site traffic to the apartmentscom network of rental websites may not be successful if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on the apartmentscom network of rental websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites if search results do not feature our websites prominently traffic to our websites would decrease and our business could be adversely affected google bing yahoo and other internet search websites drive traffic to our websites including costarcom the apartmentscom network of rental websites loopnetcom bizbuysellcom and landsofamericacom for example when a user types an apartment building address into an internet search engine organic search ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed in the search results however our ability to maintain high organic search result rankings is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization or seo efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than the rankings our websites receive or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings each of which could slow the growth of our user base further search engine providers could align with our competitors which could adversely affect traffic to our websites our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenue from our marketplace businesses depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites if we fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected our marketing expenses have increased and may continue to increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites our efforts to maintain or generate additional traffic to our marketplaces may not be successful even if we are able to attract additional users increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenue through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products we face competition to attract users to our marketplace websites our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to our own that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources if we are unable to increase traffic to our marketplaces or if we are unable to generate enough additional revenue to offset increases in expenses related to increasing traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom depend on advertising revenue generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

 

further with respect to the apartmentscom network of rental websites our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

we do not have longterm contracts with most of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice in addition as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenue and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we do not invest in product development and provide services that are attractive to our users and to our advertisers our business could be adversely affected  our success depends on our continued improvements to provide services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to our advertisers as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies if we are unable to provide services that users want to use then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors’ websites if we are unable to continue offering innovative services we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are not able to successfully finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products potential increases in operating costs managing geographically remote operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential disruptions in ongoing operations during integration the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain and the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations new services or other significant or strategic information general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

the failure to successfully integrate apartmentscom or apartment finder andor fully realize expected synergies from those acquisitions in the expected time frames or at all may adversely affect our future results and our business the success of the apartmentscom and apartment finder acquisitions depends in part on our ability to successfully integrate those businesses and realize the benefits and synergies we anticipate to result from the combination of our business and the businesses of apartmentscom and apartment finder including anticipated growth opportunities and cost savings we may not be able to achieve these objectives in whole or in part achievement of the objectives may take longer than expected or achievement of the objectives may be more costly than expected any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our revenues expenses and operating results 

the success of the apartmentscom and apartment finder acquisitions will also depend in part on our ability to minimize or eliminate any difficulties that may occur in connection with the integration of our business and those acquired businesses the integration process could result in the loss of key employees loss of key clients loss of key vendors and other business partners increases in operating costs increases in taxes or the disruption of each companys ongoing businesses any or all of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of the respective acquisition our efforts to integrate the businesses may divert managements attention and other resources from uses that could otherwise have been beneficial to the company in addition management may decide to combine or eliminate products or services currently offered by one of the acquired businesses which could also result in the loss of revenues key employees key clients key vendors or other business partners 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of and to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together and how we can best address those uses through standalone services or combinations or coordinating applications thereof in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources in february 2015 we launched the improved apartmentscom website and in december 2015 we launched the new apartmentfindercom website both after undergoing extensive product development in 2015 we also launched a widescale marketing campaign in an effort to increase brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom the launch of the sites andor the marketing campaign may not result in increased brand awareness site traffic andor revenues if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the new launch and marketing campaign which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced for example we continue to assess whether to transition the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free we would expect to see a shortterm reduction in revenues and earnings if we implement this transition although we are assessing the best strategy to implement this shift and will seek to convert customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services which should increase revenues and earnings over time we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be successful in shifting customers to higher value more profitable subscriptions and consequently in offsetting any reduction in revenue and earnings therefore if we make this transition our revenues and earnings may ultimately decline in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services we are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues and reducing our profitability 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers advertisers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins over the past few years we have increased the rate of investments in our business including internal investments in product development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of investments furthermore our investments may not have their intended effect in addition our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which our services may be provided the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position 

we seek to enforce our rights against people and entities that infringe our intellectual property including through legal action taking such action may be costly and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we also collect store and use sensitive or confidential transaction information and in certain circumstances credit card information as a result we are subject to a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new products 

the useu safe harbor framework which established means for legitimizing the transfer of personal data by us companies from the european economic area or eea to the us recently was invalidated by a decision of the european court of justice or the ecj in light of the ecj’s decision we have begun to undertake efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the eea based on current regulatory obligations the guidance of data protection authorities and evolving best practices we continue to review our business practices and the evolving regulations and may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our personal data handling or engage in additional efforts to cause our transfer and receipt of eea residents’ personal data to be legitimized under applicable european law we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain euorigin data in the european economic area which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business 

despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means of transferring certain data from the eea including due to ongoing legislative activity which may vary the current data protection landscape our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable privacy or data security laws regulations and policies or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions and significant penalties against us which could result in negative publicity increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products if so in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims and penalties we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products which could harm our business 

we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of personally identifiable of information are described on our websites while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies we could be subject to legal claims government action harm to our reputation or experience significant remediation costs if we experience a security breach or our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

concern of prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards for customer payments  we accept payments for our services through credit and debit card transactions for credit and debit card payments we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time an increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our cost of revenues either of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards card holders and transactions if we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit cardrelated costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web product and development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments north america and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 13 billion  of goodwill including 12 billion  in our north america segment and 256 million  in our international segment 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to loopnet the apartmentscom network of rental websites costar showcase landandfarmcom and landsofamericacom could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of property listings submitted by brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including bizbuysell and bizquest are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are used to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale our revenues could be negatively affected 

the number of loopnets registered members is higher than the number of actual members the number of registered members in loopnets network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations or others may have registered under fictitious names given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members and thus we rely on the number of registered members as a measure of the size of the loopnet marketplace if the number of loopnets actual members does not continue to grow and those members do not convert to premium members then the loopnet marketplace business may not grow as fast as we expect which could harm our operating and financial results 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited property and portfolio research ltd grecam sas and the assets of belbex corporate sl as well as our expansion into canada a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound euro and canadian dollar as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs  on april 1 2014 we entered into the 2014 credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2014 credit agreement provides for a 4000 million term loan facility and a 2250 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years we used the proceeds of the term loan facility and 1500 million of the initial borrowing under the revolving credit facility to refinance the term loan facility and revolving credit facility established under a credit agreement dated february 16 2012 the “2012 credit agreement” including related fees and expenses and pay a portion of the consideration and transaction costs related to the apartmentscom acquisition the 2014 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to i incur additional indebtedness ii create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv make investments and acquisitions v make certain dispositions of assets vi make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2014 credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the 2014 credit agreement if an event of default occurs the interest rate on overdue amounts will increase and the lenders under the 2014 credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the 2014 credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2015  we held 168 million  par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2015  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2015  we determined there was a net decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 435000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2015  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events our users rely on our services when conducting their own businesses disruptions in or reductions in ability to access our services for whatever reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or result in reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and online marketplaces which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected  the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results in addition our results may be impacted by seasonality the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slow downs during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company    on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov requires costar to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires costar to maintain its customary practice of selling its products separately and on a marketbymarket basis it also requires costar to license its products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition costar is required to maintain its customary licensing practices with respect to the length of its contracts to allow customers with multiyear contracts to cancel with one years advance notice and to agree to reduce the cost of any litigation with customers by offering to arbitrate certain disputes in the event that costar fails or is unable to comply with the terms of the consent order costar could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief further the provisions of the consent order may result in unanticipated adverse effects on the combined company and therefore reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger for example the terms of the consent order that require us to continue to sell our products separately may prohibit us from combining or eliminating certain business lines products or services that we believe would result in a longterm positive impact on our revenue and earnings 

we have incurred and will continue to incur acquisitionrelated costs    we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate prior acquisitions such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options

subscriptionbased services 

our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of information analytics and online marketplace services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscriptionbased license agreements that renew automatically a majority of which have a term of one year upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage or number of paid clicks depending on the type of service contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the clients business focus geography the number and types of services to which a client subscribes the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a clients advertised properties in the search results our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 

our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar suite tm  services costar suite is sold as a platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional ®  costar comps professional ® and costar tenant ®  and through our mobile application costargo® costar suite is our primary service offering in our north america and international operating segments 

as of december 31 2014  and 2015  our annualized net new sales of subscriptionbased services on annual contracts were approximately 173 million  and 292 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from new annual subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on existing annual subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported we recognize subscription revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2014  and 2015  our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services was approximately 92  and 90  respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 8  and 10  respectively for the same time periods the recent decrease in our contract renewal rate is related to the execution of annual contracts by many of our loopnet customers who historically have not signed long term agreements and typically have a lower renewal rate than the rest of our subscriptionbased customers our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

apartment rental marketplaces 

on april 1 2014 the “closing date” we increased our presence in the multifamily vertical by acquiring from classified ventures llc “cv” certain assets and assuming certain liabilities in each case related to the apartmentscom business collectively referred to as “apartmentscom” a national online apartment rentals resource for renters property managers and owners apartmentscom offers renters a database of apartment listings and provides professional property management companies and landlords an advertising destination renters can conduct personalized searches of apartment listings and view video demonstrations and community reviews through the apartmentscom website and mobile applications the apartmentscom network of rental websites also includes apartmenthomelivingcom another national online apartment rentals resource 

apartmentscom draws on costar’s multifamily database which contains detailed information on apartment properties we designed the improved apartmentscom website which was launched in february 2015 to meet renter preferences and demands which we believe will drive traffic to the site and attract advertisers who prefer to advertise on heavily trafficked apartment websites the site provides a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods including restaurants nightlife history schools and other facts important to renters to help renters find the information that meets their needs the site also offers innovative search tools such as the polygon tm  search which allows renters to specifically define the area in which they want to find an apartment and plan commute tools which allows renters to search property listings that meet their transportation needs 

to further support our expansion into the multifamily vertical on june 1 2015 we acquired network communications inc “nci” including its apartment finder business collectively referred to as “apartment finder” apartment finder provides lead generation advertising and internet marketing solutions to property managers and owners through its main service apartmentfindercom similar to apartmentscom we developed technology to allow apartmentfindercom to draw on costar’s multifamily database in december 2015 we launched the new apartmentfindercom website to meet renter preferences and demands which we believe will drive traffic to the site and attract advertisers who prefer to advertise on heavily trafficked apartment websites we also have phased out print advertising from apartment finder and moved to an alldigital offering 

in 2015 we entered into an agreement to be the exclusive third party provider of apartment community listings on the websites owned and operated by news corp subsidiary move inc realtorcom® movecom and doorstepscom  with advertiser content from apartmentscom and apartmentfindercom through this agreement we are able to promote the apartment communities of our advertisers across six major apartment and real estate rental websites increasing traffic across our network of apartment marketing websites and in turn increasing the lead flow to our advertisers’ communities 

similar to our other past acquisitions we have been and plan to continue integrating further developing and crossselling the services offered by apartmentscom and apartmentfindercom and the other services we offer including but not limited to costar market analytics we have incurred and plan to continue to incur product development costs to improve the online apartmentscom and apartmentfindercom platforms we have increased our sales and marketing expenses in order to support apartmentscom and to increase brand awareness in conjunction with the launch of the improved apartmentscom website we embarked on a widescale marketing campaign in 2015 to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom the marketing campaign featured television and radio advertising onlinedigital advertising social media and outofhome ads and was reinforced by search engine marketing we also increased our search engine marketing to support apartment finder in 2016 we ran a super bowl ad to continue to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing in 2016 as we continue to assess the success and effectiveness of our marketing campaign we will also seek to determine the optimal level of marketing investment in the future 

development and expansion 

we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research and sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our information news analytic and online marketplace solutions 

the launch of the improved apartmentscom website in february 2015 and the new apartmentfindercom website in december 2015 are examples of our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services and crosssell existing services we believe the improved sites enhanced search capabilities availability of information regarding realtime vacancies and our continued development and introduction of enhancements to our online apartment rental marketplaces will attract more consumers making these sites more attractive to property managers which will increase our crossselling opportunities our software development initiatives in 2015 included enhancing our new costar lease analysis ®  integrated workflow tool to provide users a simple way to produce understandable cash flows for leases and to enhance other lease comparable services we believe greater functionality makes our services valuable to an even broader audience and helps us increase sales of our services to brokers banks owners and institutional investors we expect technology enhancements to drive continued revenue growth in 2016 and for the foreseeable future 

we evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs further in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs we may decide to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that among other things overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer in the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings we may experience reduced revenues and earnings the decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services for example we recently eliminated certain apartment finder services and phased out apartment finder print advertising and moved to an alldigital offering we expect a shortterm reduction in revenues and associated costs resulting from the elimination of these apartment finder services additionally we are working to integrate the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases so that the two services will share a unified database of information in order to create efficiencies in operations and improved data for our customers we also hope to increase the quantity and quality of the listing information available by enabling select brokers and other industry participants to load information directly into the integrated system simultaneously reducing the time and costs associated with researching and maintaining our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information further we continue to assess whether to transition the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free if and when we implement such a shift we will seek to convert loopnet marketplace customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services which should increase revenues and earnings over time however we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings if any resulting from any eliminations or phasing out of the loopnet information services or any other service offering if implemented 

our revenues have increased as a result of revenue from acquired businesses and from crossselling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies we expect to continue to increase revenues as a result of such crossselling opportunities we may incur increased expenses in connection with any marketing and sales campaigns involving crossselling opportunities and initiatives and in connection with promotion of our new services and brands 

we are expanding the geographic reach of our north america services in 2014 we began offering our services in toronto canada building on our experience in toronto we have expanded and are continuing to expand our research into additional canadian cities in the second quarter of 2015 we began offering services in calgary and vancouver and are currently researching commercial real estate in the canadian cities of ottawa and edmonton further on july 1 2015 we expanded our international services into madrid spain through the acquisition of the assets of belbex corporate sl a small commercial real estate information provider operating in madrid we believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services including expansion of our existing service offerings have created a platform for longterm revenue growth we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscriptionbased services and the successful crossselling of our services to customers in existing markets 

we have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company in north america and internationally we plan to continue to invest in evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the company continues to develop and grow we are also investing in our research capacity to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to support apartmentscom and apartment finder to expand into additional canadian markets and to provide services in madrid spain while we believe investments we make in our business create a platform for growth those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or internal expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future any development efforts must comply with our credit facility which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business 

financial matters 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods see item 7a for details on the impact currency changes have on our results of operations currency exchange rate volatility may continue which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and periodtoperiod comparisons of our consolidated operations 

we currently issue stock options andor restricted stock to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations the amount and timing of the compensation expense that we record depends on the amount and types of equity grants made we plan to continue to use stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income grants of equity awards may vest over time or based on achievement of preapproved performance conditions and market conditions 

in february 2014 the compensation committee of our board of directors approved grants of restricted common stock to our executive officers that vest based on our achievement of a threeyear cumulative revenue goal established at the grant date and are subject to forfeiture in the event the foregoing performance condition is not met by december 31 2016 in march 2015 the compensation committee of our board of directors approved grants of restricted common stock to our executive officers that vest based on our achievement of a threeyear cumulative revenue goal established at the grant date and are subject to forfeiture in the event the foregoing performance condition is not met by december 31 2017 these grants of restricted common stock are also subject to continuing employment requirements and a market condition based on total shareholder return “tsr” the actual number of shares that vest at the end of the respective threeyear period is determined based on our achievement of the threeyear performance goals described above as well as our tsr relative to the russell 1000 index over the related threeyear performance period as of december 31 2015  we reassessed the probability of achieving the performance and market conditions and determined that it was still probable that the performance and market conditions for the 2014 and 2015 performancebased restricted common stock awards would be met by their respective forfeiture dates as a result we recorded a total of approximately 11 million  and 28 million  of stockbased compensation expense related to the performancebased restricted common stock awards with a market condition for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2015  respectively we expect to record an estimated unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to the performancebased restricted common stock awards of approximately 53 million  over the periods 2016 2017 and 2018 

the compensation committee of our board of directors may grant additional performancebased equity awards in the future under the company’s 2007 stock incentive plan 

property developments 

as in the past we expect to continue to identify new facilities and consolidate existing facilities to better accommodate the changing demands of our business and employees as a result we may incur additional lease restructuring charges for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities “ars” whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2015  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of contractual cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period 

the only significant unobservable input in the discounted cash flow model is the discount rate the discount rate used represents our estimate of the yield expected by a market participant from the ars investments the weighted average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2014  and 2015  was approximately 41  and 47  respectively selecting another discount rate within the range used in the discounted cash flow model would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the ars 

based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2015  we determined there was a net decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 435000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2015  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

stockbased compensation 

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option for equity instruments that vest based on a market condition we estimate the fair value of each equity instrument granted on the date of grant using a montecarlo simulation model which also requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the equity instruments these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of our stock price for equity instruments that vest based on performance we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability of whether the performance conditions would be met if our initial estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions change the related stockbased compensation expense and timing of recognition may fluctuate from period to period based on those estimates if the performance conditions are not met no stockbased compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized stockbased compensation expense will be reversed 

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2015  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customer bases acquired database technology and acquired trade names from a market participants perspective useful lives and discount rates during the measurement period we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments north america and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation as of october 1 2015 that revenues will continue to increase as a result of further penetration of our international subscriptionbased services including into madrid spain and the successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2015 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2015 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform a quantitative impairment test we estimate the fair value of our existing indefinitelived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate revenue growth rate and royalty rate assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the revenue growth rate are based on our forecasts business plans and economic projections assumptions about the royalty rate are based on royalty agreements for comparable companies with similar intangible assets 

as of october 1 2015 the date of our most recent annual impairment analysis the estimated fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded the carrying value there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2015 that would indicate that the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable 

during the first quarter of 2014 we finalized a branding initiative plan that included among other things rebranding some of the services provided by our wholly owned subsidiaries in order to better organize update streamline and optimize our branding strategy we launched the branding initiative externally in the second quarter of 2014 following the external launch of the branding initiative we ceased using certain of our trade names we evaluated these assets for impairment during the first quarter of 2014 and determined that the carrying value of trade names we ceased using exceeded the fair value the adjusted carrying value of our trade name intangible assets associated with the branding initiative was amortized through the date of the external launch of the branding initiative and the fully amortized gross carrying amount was written off during the three months ended june 30 2014 

during the third quarter of 2014 we finalized and launched a separate marketing plan that included the rebranding of a service provided by another one of our wholly owned subsidiaries in order to provide our customers with a more enhanced experience following the external launch of the branding initiative we ceased using one of our trade names we evaluated the asset for impairment during the third quarter of 2014 and determined that the carrying value of the trade name that we ceased using exceeded the fair value 

as a result of these branding and marketing plans during 2014 we recorded impairment charges of approximately 18 million in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations within our north america operating segment for the year ended december 31 2014 

in february 2015 as a result of our product development efforts we launched the improved apartmentscom website with a cleaner look information about actual rental availabilities rents and other fees and better search functionality in conjunction with the launch we ceased using the database technology acquired in the acquisition of apartmentscom we evaluated the acquired database technology for impairment during the first quarter of 2015 and determined that the carrying value of the acquired database technology was impaired as we had ceased using the asset 

in june 2015 following the june 1 2015 acquisition of apartment finder we decided to cease providing certain apartment finder services additionally in june 2015 we decided to cease development work related to a development project within apartment finder we evaluated the acquired customer base and acquired database technology for impairment during the second quarter of 2015 and based on that evaluation determined that the customer base and database technology assets associated with the ceased services and development work were impaired as they were not expected to provide us with any economic benefit 

as a result of the launch of the improved apartmentscom website in 2015 and the decision to cease providing certain apartment finder services we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 28 million which was recorded in cost of revenues and general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations within the companys north america operating segment for the year ended december 31 2015 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share also referred to as “nongaap eps” ebitda is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income loss in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 28 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and online marketplace services which has included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs and restructuring costs adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are purchase amortization and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2013  2014  and 2015  we assumed a 38 tax rate in order to approximate our longterm effective corporate tax rate 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income loss per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and debt from our term loan and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents were 4218 million  at december 31 2015  compared to cash and cash equivalents of 5270 million  at december 31 2014  the decrease  in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily due to net cash paid of 1823 million  for the acquisitions of apartment finder the assets of belbex corporate sl and certain assets related to the business operations of apartment finders independent distributors 

changes in cash and cash equivalents are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable various accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises and similar events 

net cash provided by  operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015  was 1312 million  compared to 1439 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the 127 million   decrease  in net cash provided by  operating activities is primarily due to a decrease  of approximately 157 million  from net income plus noncash items partially offset by a net increase  of approximately 30 million  in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements 

net cash used in  investing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  was 2155 million  compared to 6060 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  this 3905 million   decrease  in net cash used in  investing activities in 2015  was primarily due to 5842 million  of cash used for the acquisition of apartmentscom on april 1 2014 partially offset by 1823 million  of cash used for the acquisitions of apartment finder the assets of belbex corporate sl and certain assets related to the business operations of apartment finders independent distributors during 2015  

net cash used in  financing activities was 205 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to net cash provided by  financing activities of 7335 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  this 7540 million  change was primarily due to proceeds of 5500 million  received under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility on april 1 2014 and the 5294 million  in net proceeds from our public equity offering in june 2014 less the 1488 million repayment of the term loan facility and revolving credit facility established under a credit agreement dated february 16 2012 the “2012 credit agreement” 1500 million repayment of the revolving credit facility associated with the credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “2014 credit agreement” and the 100 million payment of debt issuance costs associated with the 2014 credit agreement which did not occur during 2015  

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2015  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 longterm debt obligations include scheduled principal payments and exclude interest payments which are based on a variable rate of interest as defined in the credit agreement 

2 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less or ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a thirdparty or us amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of 67 million  due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 

during 2015  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 351 million  we expect to make aggregate capital expenditures in 2016  of approximately 300 million to 350 million primarily related to the build out of leased office space and investments in technology 

in conjunction with the launch of the improved apartmentscom website we embarked on a widescale marketing campaign in 2015 to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing including sales and marketing for apartmentscom and our other brands as we seek to grow the number of our subscribers and advertisers 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions

in connection with obtaining the term loan facility and revolving credit facility pursuant to the 2014 credit agreement we incurred approximately 101 million in debt issuance costs as of april 1 2014 the debt issuance costs were comprised of approximately 97 million in underwriting fees and approximately 400000 primarily related to legal fees associated with the debt issuance approximately 100 million of the fees associated with the refinancing along with the unamortized debt issuance cost from the 2012 credit agreement were capitalized and are amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2014 credit agreement using the effective interest method

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2015  we had 168 million  par value of longterm investments in student loan ars which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the shortterm in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb and international accounting standards board “iasb” jointly issued a new revenue recognition standard that is designed to improve financial reporting by creating common recognition guidance for us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” this guidance provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improves the comparability of revenue recognition practices across industries provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the presentation of financial statements the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this guidance permits the use of either a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective approach the modified retrospective approach would be applied only to the most current period presented along with a cumulativeeffect adjustment at the date of adoption the original effective date of the new standard was for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period   in august 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that defers by one year the effective date of this new revenue recognition standard as a result the new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 although companies may adopt the standard as early as the original effective date early application prior to the original effective date is not permitted we have  not yet determined when we will adopt the standard or selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs this guidance requires a company to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this guidance in august 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standards update to address the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements the guidance allows an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a lineofcredit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings under the lineofcredit arrangement the april 2015 guidance and the august 2015 guidance are effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is permitted we have elected to early adopt this guidance on a retrospective basis this guidance did not have a material impact on the companys results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2014 and 2015 but it did require changes to the presentation of the 2014 and 2015 consolidated balance sheets and the notes to the consolidated financial statements we capitalized debt issuance costs net of amortization of approximately 132 million  and 99 million  as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2015  respectively these amounts are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from a combination of the current and longterm portion of debt rather than as an asset in accordance with the authoritative guidance see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further details on the presentation of debt issuance costs 

in november 2015 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes this guidance requires a company to present deferred income tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the balance sheet the guidance requiring a taxpaying component of a company to offset deferred tax liabilities and assets and present the deferred taxes as a single amount is not affected by this guidance this guidance is effective on either a prospective or retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is permitted we have elected to early adopt this guidance on a prospective basis and as a result prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2015

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental units available rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database approximately 1481  researchers and outside contractors our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

within the apartment rental community most apartment websites primarily supply only the listings that property owners pay to advertise and often return results that are inconsistent with the renters search criteria these limited results generally do not provide information about the actual rental availabilities we believe that consumers expect accurate actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information to create the new apartmentscom website we have drawn on our multifamily database and undertaken a research effort collecting and verifying information and visiting and photographing properties with the launch of the new apartmentscom website we believe that we have created an easily searchable site with a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual rental availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods including restaurants nightlife history schools and other important facts 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 27  years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images

data and image providers  we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third party data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and online marketplaces and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems  our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

competition 

the market for information analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the market for information analytics and online marketplaces develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena a company like zillow which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and online marketplaces our subscriptionbased information analytics and online marketplaces generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business including competitors that offer their services through rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

  

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes that negatively impact investment returns excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate a reversal of improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and online marketplaces also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to cancellations of our information analytics and online marketplace services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition we compete to attract advertisers large companies with significant brand recognition have large numbers of direct sales personnel and web traffic which may provide a competitive advantage to compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands including costar loopnet or apartmentscom which could adversely affect our business we rely heavily on our brands which we believe are key assets of our company awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of and subscribers to our online marketplaces such as apartmentscom and loopnetcom in 2015 we expect to increase our investment in sales and marketing activities by approximately 750 million to increase brand awareness and grow traffic in conjunction a widescale marketing campaign commencing during the first quarter of 2015 and running throughout the remainder of 2015 to generate brand awareness and site traffic for the improved apartmentscom website further we expect that sales and marketing expenses for our other brands will continue to increase as we seek to grow the number of subscribers or advertisers to our marketplaces increased advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or ultimately be costeffective if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands or if we are unable to recover our additional marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites if search results do not feature our websites prominently traffic to our websites would decrease and our business could be adversely affected google bing yahoo and other internet search websites drive traffic to our websites including apartmentscom and loopnetcom for example when a user types an apartment building address into an internet search engine organic search ranking of our apartmentscom webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed in the search results however our ability to maintain high organic search result rankings is not entirely within our control our competitors’ search engine optimization or seo efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than the rankings our websites receive or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings each of which could slow the growth of our user base further search engine providers could align with our competitors which could adversely affect traffic to our websites our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to generate revenue from our marketplace businesses depends in part on our ability to attract users to our websites if we fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected we expect that our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites our efforts to maintain or generate additional traffic to our marketplaces may not be successful even if we are able to attract additional users increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenue through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products we also face competition to attract users to our marketplace websites our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to our own that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources if we are unable to increase traffic to our marketplaces or if we are unable to generate enough additional revenue to offset increases in expenses related to increasing traffic to our marketplaces our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our operating results would be harmed our marketplace businesses including the apartmentscom business and loopnetcom depend on advertising revenue generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry including property managers and owners and other advertisers our ability to attract and retain advertisers and ultimately to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors including 

 

further with respect to the apartmentscom marketplace our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates if vacancy rates are too high or too low advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services 

we do not have longterm contracts with most of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice in addition as existing subscriptions for advertising expire we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives in addition future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers our advertising revenue and business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we do not invest in product development and provide services that are attractive to our users and to our advertisers our business could be adversely affected  our success depends on our continued improvements to provide services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to our advertisers as a result we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies if we are unable to provide services that users want to use then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors’ websites if we are unable to continue offering innovative services we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are not able to successfully finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergy created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products potential increases in operating costs managing geographically remote operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential disruptions in ongoing operations during integration the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain and the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business 

the failure to successfully integrate the apartmentscom business andor fully realize expected synergies from the acquisition in the expected time frame or at all may adversely affect our future results and our business the success of the apartmentscom acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the apartmentscom business and realize the benefits and synergies we anticipate to result from the combination of our business and the apartmentscom business including anticipated growth opportunities and cost savings we may not be able to achieve these objectives in whole or in part any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our revenues expenses and operating results 

the success of the acquisition will also depend in part on our ability to minimize or eliminate any difficulties that may occur in connection with the integration of our business and the apartmentscom business the integration process could result in the loss of key employees loss of key clients loss of key vendors and other business partners increases in operating costs increases in taxes or the disruption of each companys ongoing businesses any or all of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition our efforts to integrate the two businesses will divert managements attention and other resources from uses that could otherwise have been beneficial to the company in addition management may decide to combine or eliminate products or services currently offered by apartmentscom which could also result in the loss of revenues key employees key clients key vendors or other business partners 

during the integration process we will depend on cv to provide certain services to us during a transitional period including among others billing and collection services if these services are not provided to us we may incur additional expense to replicate or procure these services from other third parties 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2015 we plan to continue to increase the depth of our coverage in the us canada and the uk if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses our us researchers use integrated internal research processes to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and online marketplace services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of and to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and online marketplace services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together and how we can best address those uses through standalone services or combinations or coordinating applications thereof in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources we recently launched the new apartmentscom website after undergoing extensive product development we also plan to launch a widescale marketing campaign in an effort to increase brand awareness and site traffic the launch of the new site andor the new marketing campaign may not result in increased brand awareness site traffic andor revenues if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share we may not be able to offset the expense associated with the new launch and marketing campaign which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced for example we are currently assessing whether to transition the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free we would expect to see a shortterm reduction in revenues and earnings if we implement this transition although we are assessing the best strategy to implement this shift and will seek to convert customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services to increase revenues and earnings over time we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be successful in shifting customers to higher value more profitable subscriptions and consequently in offsetting any reduction in revenue and earnings therefore if we make this transition our revenues and earnings may ultimately decline in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues and reducing our profitability 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in this market may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins over the past few years we have increased the rate of investments in our business including internal investments in product development and sales and marketing to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of investments furthermore our investments may not have their intended effect for instance our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business brands competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property including intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trademark trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property including our content our brands and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability 

effective trademark trade secret patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which our services may be provided the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could harm our competitive position 

in addition we seek to enforce our rights against people and entities that infringe our intellectual property including through legal action taking such action may be costly and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards for customer payments  we accept payments for our services through credit and debit card transactions for credit and debit card payments we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time an increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our cost of revenues either of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies in addition if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and as a result we do not charge our customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business revenue results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors any failure to comply also may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments further there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards card holders and transactions if we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions we may face civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit cardrelated costs each of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims 

if we fail to protect confidential information against security breaches or if customers or potential customers are reluctant to use our services because of privacy concerns we might face additional costs and could lose customers or potential customers we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses we also collect store and use sensitive or confidential transaction information and in certain circumstances credit card information our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of these types of information are described on our websites while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies we could be subject to legal claims government action harm to our reputation or experience significant remediation costs if we experience a security breach or our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and online marketplaces to users 

concern of prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business under various state laws if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that unencrypted personal customer data has been stolen we are required to inform any customers whose data was stolen which could result in significant costs and harm our reputation and business 

in addition certain state laws require businesses that maintain personal information in electronic databases to implement reasonable measures to keep that information secure various states have enacted different and sometimes contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of the different states is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours which collects personal information from customers in multiple jurisdictions 

we may face adverse publicity and loss of consumer confidence if we are not able to comply with laws requiring us to take adequate measures to assure the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information that our customers have given to us this could result in a loss of customers and revenue that could jeopardize our success even if we are in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations we may face liability or disruption of business if we do not comply in every instance or if the security of the customer data that we collect is compromised regardless of whether our practices comply or not if we were required to pay any significant amount of money in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to suspend operations for any length of time due to our inability to comply fully with any such laws our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the acquisition of the apartmentscom business   uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on our employees including employees who joined the company as a result of the acquisition of the apartmentscom business may have an adverse effect on the combined business this uncertainty may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel if our key employees or apartmentscom key employees depart we may incur costs in identifying hiring training and retaining replacements for departing employees which could reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the apartmentscom business 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments north america and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 11 billion  of goodwill including 11 billion  in our north america segment and 244 million  in our international segment 

as a result of the consolidation of certain of our facilities we may incur additional costs  we have taken and may continue to take actions that may increase our cost structure in the shortterm but are intended to reduce certain portions of our longterm cost structure such as consolidation of office space as a result of consolidation of office space we may reduce our longterm occupancy costs but incur restructuring charges if our longterm cost reduction efforts are ineffective or our estimates of cost savings are inaccurate our profitability could be negatively impacted expected savings from relocating facilities can be highly variable and uncertain further we may not be successful in achieving the operating efficiencies or operating cost reductions expected from these efforts in the amounts or at the times we anticipate 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents property owners and apartment property managers our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to loopnet apartmentscom costar showcase landandfarmcom and lands of america could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of property listings submitted by brokers agents property owners and in the case of apartment rentals property managers this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including bizbuysell and bizquest are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are used to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale our revenues could be negatively affected 

the number of loopnets registered members is higher than the number of actual members the number of registered members in loopnets network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations or others may have registered under fictitious names given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members and thus we rely on the number of registered members as a measure of the size of the loopnet marketplace if the number of loopnets actual members does not continue to grow and those members do not convert to premium members then the loopnet marketplace business may not grow as fast as we expect which could harm our operating and financial results 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our historic revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited grecam sas and property and portfolio research ltd as well as our expansion into canada a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound euro and canadian dollar as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs  on april 1 2014 the “closing date” we entered into the 2014 credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2014 credit agreement provides for a 4000 million term loan facility and a 2250 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years the proceeds of the term loan facility and the initial borrowing under the revolving credit facility on the closing date in an amount of 1500 million were used to refinance the term loan facility and revolving credit facility established under a credit agreement dated february 16 2012 the “2012 credit agreement” including related fees and expenses and pay a portion of the consideration and transaction costs related to the acquisition the 2014 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to i incur additional indebtedness ii create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv make investments and acquisitions v make certain dispositions of assets vi make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2014 credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the 2014 credit agreement if an event of default occurs the interest rate on overdue amounts will increase and the lenders under the 2014 credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the 2014 credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2014  we held 187 million  par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2014  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2014  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 691000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2014  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

us political credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact or impair the value of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments including us treasury securities and usbacked investments as well as our access to credit   our cash cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of common financial instruments including us treasury securities deterioration in the us credit and financial markets may result in losses or deterioration in the fair value of our cash cash equivalents or investments on august 5 2011 standard  poor’s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa this downgrade and any future downgrades of the us credit rating could impact the stability of future us treasury auctions affect the trading market for us government securities result in increased interest rates and impair access to credit these factors could negatively impact the liquidity or valuation of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments which may affect our ability to fund future obligations further these factors may result in an increase in interest rates and borrowing costs and make it more difficult to obtain credit on acceptable terms which may affect our ability to fund future obligations and increase the costs of obtaining financing for future obligations 

technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications database and network systems underlying our services could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services lower revenues and increased costs  our business brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our websites the internet and our service providers interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses software errors physical or electronic breakins or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems such as denial of service attacks could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events our users rely on our services when conducting their own businesses disruptions in or reductions in ability to access our services for whatever reason could damage our users’ businesses harm our reputation result in additional costs or result in reduced demand for our information analytics and online marketplace services any of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and online marketplaces which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

the majority of the communications network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss security breaches computer viruses telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins earthquakes and similar events these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 

a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible problems faced or cause by our information technology service providers including content distribution service providers private network providers internet providers and thirdparty webhosting providers or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers as applicable could adversely affect the experience of our users any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by these thirdparty service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict if our thirdparty service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity our business could be harmed in addition if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications which could harm our business 

our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses including the potential harm to the future growth of our business which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected  the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results in addition our results may be impacted by seasonality the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slow downs during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company    on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at httpwwwftcgov requires costar to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires costar to maintain its customary practice of selling its products separately and on a marketbymarket basis it also requires costar to license its products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition costar is required to maintain its customary licensing practices with respect to the length of its contracts to allow customers with multiyear contracts to cancel with one years advance notice and to agree to reduce the cost of any litigation with customers by offering to arbitrate certain disputes in the event that costar fails or is unable to comply with the terms of the consent order costar could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief further the provisions of the consent order may result in unanticipated adverse effects on the combined company and therefore reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger for example the terms of the consent order that require us to continue to sell our products separately may prohibit us from combining or eliminating certain business lines products or services that we believe would result in a longterm positive impact on our revenue and earnings 

we have incurred and will continue to incur acquisitionrelated costs    we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate prior acquisitions such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations new services or other significant or strategic information general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock

we have five flagship brands  costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell and landsofamerica our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar suite tm  services costar suite is sold as a platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional® costar comps professional® and costar tenant® and through our mobile application costargo® our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information information about properties for sale tenant information internet marketing services analytical capabilities information for clients websites information about industry professionals and their business relationships data integration and industry news we provide market research and analysis for commercial real estate investors and lenders via our costar portfolio strategy and costar market analytics service offerings portfolio and debt analysis management and reporting capabilities through our costar investment analysis and costar risk analytics service offerings and real estate and lease management solutions including lease administration and abstraction services through our costar real estate manager service offerings

our service offerings span all commercial property types including office retail industrial multifamily commercial land mixeduse and hospitality 

to more fully integrate and connect our services and ultimately to provide improved access to our resources we launched a new brand identity in may 2014 the new branding is designed to unite our flagship brands  costar loopnet apartmentscom bizbuysell and landsofamerica  with a modern cohesive look that will enhance customers’ access to the full breadth of our information analytics and online marketplace solutions the resulting streamlined network of platforms is expected to improve the customer experience and make it easier for customers to find the most useful tools for their commercial real estate information analytics and online marketplace needs the new brand identity was unveiled in connection with the launch of our new corporate website and newly designed website interfaces for costar loopnet and apartmentscom our new website interfaces provide streamlined navigation and search functions for visitors and enable customers to quickly access our marketleading services since introducing our new brand identity in may 2014 we have relaunched the apartmentscom website 

  

subscriptionbased services 

our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar suite tm services costar suite is our primary service offering in our north america and international operating segments prior to the third quarter of 2014 focus tm  was our primary service offering in our international operating segment we introduced costar suite in the uk in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no longer offered focus to new clients beginning in 2013 

our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of similar services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscriptionbased license agreements that renew automatically a majority of which have a term of one year upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased information services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the clients business focus geography and the number and types of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 

as of december 31 2013  and 2014  our annualized net new sales of subscriptionbased services on annual contracts were approximately 158 million  and 173 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from new annual subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on existing annual subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported we recognize subscription revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2013  and 2014  our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services was approximately 93  and 92  respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 7  and 8  respectively for the same time periods our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

recent acquisition 

on april 1 2014 the “closing date” we increased our presence in the multifamily vertical by acquiring the apartmentscom business a national online apartment rentals resource for renters property managers and owners we purchased from cv the apartmentscom business for 5842 million in cash after taking into account net working capital adjustments 

apartmentscom offers renters a database of apartment listings and provides professional property management companies and landlords with an advertising destination renters can conduct personalized searches of apartment listings and view video demonstrations and community reviews through the apartmentscom website and mobile applications the apartmentscom network of rental websites also includes apartmenthomelivingcom another national online apartment rentals resource 

apartmentscom draws on costar’s multifamily database which contains detailed information on apartment properties and a research effort to document the apartment industry in the us costar designed the new apartmentscom website which was launched in february 2015 around the needs of the renter in order to drive traffic to the site and attract advertisers who prefer to advertise on heavily trafficked apartment websites the newly launched site provides a comprehensive selection of rentals information on actual availabilities and rents and indepth data on neighborhoods including restaurants nightlife history schools and other important facts to help renters find the information that meets their needs the new site also offers innovative search tools 

similar to our other past acquisitions we plan to integrate further develop and crosssell the services offered by the apartmentscom business and the other services we offer we have incurred and plan to continue to incur product development costs to improve the online apartmentscom platform and we plan to increase our sales and marketing expenses in order to support the apartmentscom business and to increase brand awareness in conjunction with the launch of the new apartmentscom website we plan to embark on a widescale marketing campaign commencing during the first quarter of 2015 and running throughout the remainder of 2015 to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom including an incremental investment of 750 million above apartmentscom’s 2014 annualized marketing spend since the close of the acquisition of the apartmentscom business the marketing campaign is expected to feature television and radio advertising onlinedigital advertising social media and outofhome ads and will be reinforced by search engine marketing 

on the closing date we also entered into the 2014 credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2014 credit agreement provides for a 4000 million term loan facility and a 2250 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years the proceeds of the term loan facility and the initial borrowing of 1500 million under the revolving credit facility on the closing date were used to refinance the term loan facility and revolving credit facility established under a credit agreement dated february 16 2012 the “2012 credit agreement” including related fees and expenses and to pay a portion of the consideration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of the apartmentscom business the undrawn proceeds of the revolving credit facility are available for our working capital needs and other general corporate purposes the obligations under the 2014 credit agreement are guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and those of our material subsidiaries in each case subject to certain exceptions pursuant to security and guarantee documents entered into on the closing date 

expansion and development 

we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our information news analytic and online marketplace solutions 

the launch of the new apartmentscom website in february 2015 is one example of our software development efforts to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services and crosssell existing services we believe the improved site enhanced search capabilities and realtime vacancies will draw more consumers making the service more valuable to property managers and increasing crossselling opportunities another example is our introduction in october 2013 of technology enhancements to costar suite our platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional costar comps professional and costar tenant the enhancements improve costar suites user interface search functionality and analytic capabilities for example the costar multifamily ®  information search allows users to access our extensive multifamily property database in addition costar lease analysis tm  an integrated workflow tool provides users a simple way to produce understandable cash flows for any proposed or existing lease we plan to continue our software development efforts to enhance our new lease analysis workflow tool and to develop other potential lease comparable services in 2015 we believe this greater functionality will make our services valuable to an even broader audience and help us increase sales of our services to brokers banks owners and institutional investors these technology enhancements are expected to drive continued revenue growth in 2015 and for the foreseeable future 

in october 2013 we also released costargo® 20 the next generation of our mobile application which was launched in the us on august 15 2011 and introduced in the uk on november 5 2012 costargo is our ipad application that integrates and provides costar suite subscribers mobile access to our comprehensive property tenant and comparable sales information costargo 20 adds powerful analytic capabilities to our comprehensive mobile solution 

in 2014 we introduced enhancements to our flagship marketing platform loopnetcom for example we added a targeted advertising service that allows brokers or firms to purchase advertisements based on geographic and property type criteria additionally we introduced provideo a service that enables owners and brokers to enhance their loopnet listings with high quality videos of interior spaces amenities and exterior features 

we continue to integrate develop and crosssell the services offered by the businesses we have acquired including apartmentscom and loopnet our goal is to upsell clients to the services that best meet their needs and to create further crossselling revenue synergies 

we evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs further in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs we may decide to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that among other things overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer in the event that we eliminate or phase out service offerings we may experience reduced revenues and earnings the decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services for example we are currently assessing whether to transition the loopnet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where eventually all listings would be paid and users could search the site for free we would expect to see a shortterm reduction in revenues and earnings if we implement this transition although we are assessing the best strategy to implement this shift and will seek to convert customers to higher value more profitable annual subscription information services to increase revenues and earnings over time we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings if any resulting from eliminations or phasing out of the loopnet information services or any other service offering if implemented 

our revenues have increased as a result of revenue from acquired businesses and from crossselling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies we expect to continue to achieve revenue synergies from acquisitions as a result of crossselling opportunities we may incur increased expenses in connection with any related marketing and sales campaigns involving crossselling opportunities and initiatives and in connection with promotion of our new services and brands 

internationally we continue to integrate our operations more fully with those in the us similar to our north america operating segment we intend to continue to upgrade our international platform of services and expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment to further those initiatives we introduced costar suite in the uk during the fourth quarter of 2012 and no longer offered focus to new clients beginning in 2013 costar suite is sold as a consistent international platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional costar comps professional and costar tenant and through the companys mobile application costargo costargo 20 was released in the uk in october 2013 simultaneous with its release in the us additionally we have upgraded our backend research operations fulfillment and customer relationship management systems to support these new uk services the financial performance of our international operating segment continues to improve during the twelve months ended december 31 2014  international ebitda increased to a positive amount as a result of increased revenue and decreased operating expenses as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013  see the “nongaap financial measures” section included in this annual report on form 10k for further details on the nongaap financial measures 

we recently expanded the geographic reach of our north america services in 2014 we began offering our services in toronto canada building on our experience in toronto we plan to expand our research into additional canadian cities we believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services including expansion of our existing service offerings have created a platform for longterm revenue growth we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling of our services to customers in existing markets 

we have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company in north america and internationally we plan to continue to invest in evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the company continues to develop and grow we are also investing in our research capacity to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to support the apartmentscom business and to expand into additional canadian markets while we believe investments we make in our business create a platform for growth those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or internal expansion development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings in 2015  and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future further our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow which may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business 

in support of our continued expansion and development during june 2014 we completed a public equity offering of 3450000 shares of common stock for 16000 per share resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately 5294 million we intend to use the net proceeds from the public equity offering to fund all or a portion of the costs of any strategic acquisitions we decide to pursue in the future to finance the growth of our business and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

financial matters 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods currency exchange rate volatility may continue which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and periodtoperiod comparisons of our consolidated operations 

we currently issue stock options andor restricted stock to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations the amount and timing of the compensation expense that we record depends on the amount and types of equity grants made we plan to continue to use stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income grants of equity awards may vest over time or based on achievement of preapproved performance conditions or market conditions 

in february 2014 the compensation committee the “committee” of our board of directors approved grants of restricted common stock to our executive officers that vest based on our achievement of a threeyear cumulative revenue goal established at the grant date and are subject to forfeiture in the event the foregoing performance condition is not met by december 31 2016these grants of restricted common stock are also subject to continuing employment requirements and a market condition based on total shareholder return “tsr” the actual number of shares that vest at the end of the respective threeyear period is determined based on our achievement of the threeyear performance goals described above as well as our tsr relative to the russell 1000 index over the related threeyear performance period as of december 31 2014  we reassessed the probability of achieving the performance and market conditions and determined that it was still probable that the performance and market conditions for these awards would be met by the december 31 2016 forfeiture date as a result we recorded a total of approximately 11 million  of stockbased compensation expense related to the performancebased restricted common stock for the year ended december 31 2014 no  stockbased compensation expense related to the grant of 2014 performancebased restricted common stock was recorded for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2013  we expect to record an estimated unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to the performancebased restricted common stock awards of approximately 27 million  over the periods 2015 2016 and 2017 

property developments 

as in the past we expect to continue to identify new facilities and consolidate existing facilities to better accommodate the changing demands of our business and employees as a result we may incur additional lease restructuring charges for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities “ars” whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2014  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of contractual cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period 

the only significant unobservable input in the discounted cash flow model is the discount rate the discount rate used represents our estimate of the yield expected by a market participant from the ars investments the weighted average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2013  and 2014  was approximately 49  and 41  respectively selecting another discount rate within the range used in the discounted cash flow model would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the ars 

based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2014  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 691000  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2014  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

stockbased compensation 

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option for equity instruments that vest based on a market condition we estimate the fair value of each equity instrument granted on the date of grant using a montecarlo simulation model which also requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the equity instruments these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of our stock price for equity instruments that vest based on performance we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability of whether the performance conditions would be met if our initial estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions change the related stockbased compensation expense and timing of recognition may fluctuate from period to period based on those estimates if the performance conditions are not met no stockbased compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized stockbased compensation expense will be reversed 

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2014  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments north america and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation as of october 1 2014 that revenues will continue to increase as a result of further penetration of our international subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2014 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2014 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the quantitative impairment test similar to the test performed on goodwill discussed above 

as of october 1 2014 the date of our most recent annual impairment analysis the estimated fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded the carrying value there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2014 that would indicate that the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable 

during the first quarter of 2014 we finalized a branding initiative plan that included among other things rebranding some of the services provided by our wholly owned subsidiaries in order to better organize update streamline and optimize our branding strategy we launched the branding initiative externally in the second quarter of 2014 following the external launch of the branding initiative we ceased using certain of our trade names we evaluated these assets for impairment during the first quarter of 2014 and determined that the carrying value of trade names we ceased using exceeded the fair value the adjusted carrying value of our trade name intangible assets associated with the branding initiative was amortized through the date of the external launch of the branding initiative and the fully amortized gross carrying amount was written off during the three months ended june 30 2014 

during the third quarter of 2014 we finalized and launched a separate marketing plan that included the rebranding of a service provided by another one of our wholly owned subsidiaries in order to provide our customers with a more enhanced experience following the external launch of the branding initiative we ceased using one of our trade names we evaluated the asset for impairment during the third quarter of 2014 and determined that the carrying value of the trade name that we ceased using exceeded the fair value 

as a result of these branding and marketing plans during 2014 we recorded impairment charges of approximately 18 million in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations within our north america operating segment for the year ended december 31 2014 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share also referred to as nongaap eps ebitda is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 27 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and online marketplace services which has included acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs and restructuring costs adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are purchase amortization and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2012  2013  and 2014  we assumed a 38 tax rate in order to approximate our longterm effective corporate tax rate 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2014  and year ended december 31 2013   

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being north america which includes the us and canada and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment   revenues  costar suite is sold as a platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional costar comps professional and costar tenant and through our mobile application costargo and is our primary service offering in our north america and international operating segments prior to the third quarter of 2014 focus was our primary service offering in our international operating segment we introduced costar suite in the uk in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no longer offered focus to new clients beginning in 2013 north america revenues increased  to 5521 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 4208 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  this increase  in north america revenues was primarily due to increased revenues of approximately 768 million  from our april 1 2014 acquisition of the apartmentscom business as well as further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates international revenues increased  to 238 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 201 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  this increase  was primarily due to further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services resulting from sales of costar suite intersegment revenue decreased  to 57000  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 339000  for the year ended december 31 2013  intersegment revenue recorded during 2014  was attributable to services performed for costar portfolio strategy by grecam sas “grecam” a wholly owned subsidiary of costar limited the companys wholly owned uk holding company intersegment revenue recorded during 2013  was attributable to services performed for our wholly owned subsidiary costar portfolio strategy by property and portfolio research ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of costar portfolio strategy intersegment revenue is recorded at an amount we believe approximates fair value intersegment revenue is eliminated from total revenues

comparison of year ended december 31 2013 and year ended december 31 2012 

revenues  revenues increased to 4409 million in 2013 from 3499 million in 2012 the 910 million increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue of approximately 528 million from our april 30 2012 acquisition of loopnet as well as the further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates 

gross margin  gross margin increased to 3118 million in 2013 from 2351 million in 2012 the gross margin percentage increased to 707 in 2013 from 672 in 2012 the increase in the gross margin amount and percentage was principally due to an increase in revenue partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues of 143 million primarily due to an increase in research personnel costs of approximately 64 million and an increase of approximately 35 million in purchase amortization from our april 30 2012 acquisition of loopnet 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses increased to 987 million in 2013 from 841 million in 2012 and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 224 in 2013 from 240 in 2012 the increase in the amount of selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to the additional selling and marketing expenses from our april 30 2012 acquisition of loopnet 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased to 468 million in 2013 from 328 million in 2012 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 106 in 2013 from 94 in 2012 the increase in the amount and percentage of software development expense was primarily due to increased personnel costs to support enhancements and upgrades to our services 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased to 970 million in 2013 from 772 million in 2012 and remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenues at approximately 220 in 2013 and 2012 the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was principally due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense 

purchase amortization expense  purchase amortization expense increased to approximately 152 million in 2013 from 136 million in 2012 and decreased as a percentage of revenue to 34 in 2013 compared to 39 in 2012 the increase in the amount of purchase amortization expense was due to additional purchase amortization expenses from our april 30 2012 acquisition of loopnet 

interest and other income  interest and other income decreased to approximately 326000 in 2013 compared to approximately 526000 in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to our lower cash and cash equivalent balance in 2013 resulting from the net cash paid for our april 30 2012 acquisition of loopnet 

interest and other expense  interest and other expense increased to 69 million in 2013 compared to 48 million in 2012 the increase was due to the additional interest expense incurred in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from the 1750 million borrowed under the term loan facility on april 30 2012 and used to fund a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs for the loopnet acquisition 

income tax expense net  income tax expense net increased to 178 million in 2013 from 132 million in 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes in 2013 as a result of our increased profitability partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in 2013 the higher effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily due to costs related to the loopnet acquisition that reduced income from operations but were not deductible for tax purposes

segment   revenues  north america revenues increased to 4208 million from 3308 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively this increase in north america revenue was primarily due to increased revenue of approximately 528 million from our april 30 2012 acquisition of loopnet as well as further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates international revenues increased to 201 million from 191 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively this increase was primarily due to further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services resulting from sales of costar suite intersegment revenue decreased to 339000 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 15 million for the year ended december 31 2012 intersegment revenue is attributable to services performed for costar portfolio strategy by property and portfolio research ltd intersegment revenue is recorded at an amount we believe approximates fair value intersegment revenue is eliminated from total revenues 

segment ebitda  north america ebitda increased to 973 million from 702 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in north america ebitda was due primarily to an increase in revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by an increase in personnel costs including the stockbased compensation expense we recorded in 2013 international ebitda increased to a lower loss of 31 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from a 100 million loss for the year ended december 31 2012 this lower loss was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs the international operating segment continues to experience improved financial performance and during the three months ended december 31 2013 international ebitda increased to a positive amount as a result of increased revenue and decreased operating expenses north america ebitda includes an allocation of approximately 800000 and 0 for the years ended 2013 and 2012 respectively this allocation represents costs incurred for international employees involved in development activities of our north america operating segment international ebitda includes a corporate allocation of approximately 400000 and 53 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively this allocation represents costs incurred for north america employees involved in management and expansion activities of our international operating segment the corporate allocation for the year ended december 31 2012 consists primarily of development costs incurred for services of north america employees to upgrade the international platform of services and expand the coverage of service offerings within the international reporting unit 

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

the following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues 





recent acquisitions 

apartmentscom  on april 1 2014 we purchased from cv certain assets and assumed certain liabilities in each case related to the apartmentscom business for 5842 million in cash after taking into account net working capital adjustments 

accounting treatment  we have applied the acquisition method to account for the apartmentscom transaction which requires that among other things assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date the purchase price was allocated to trade names customer base database technology building photography goodwill and various other asset and liability accounts the acquired customer base for the acquisition consists of one distinct intangible asset is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships and has an estimated useful life of 10 years the acquired database technology has an estimated useful life of 1 year due to our intent to replace the existing database technology in 2015 the acquired trade names and other intangible assets have a weighted average estimated useful life of 13 years the acquired building photography has an estimated useful life of 3 years amortization of the acquired customer base is recognized on an accelerated basis related to the expected economic benefit of the intangible asset while amortization of the acquired database technology acquired building photography and acquired trade names and other intangible assets are recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life goodwill for the acquisition is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of apartmentscom have been consolidated with those of the company since the date of the acquisition see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further details on the acquisition of the apartmentscom business 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and debt from our term loan and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents were 5270 million  at december 31 2014  compared to cash and cash equivalents of 2560 million  at december 31 2013  the increase  in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily due to 5294 million in net proceeds from our public equity offering in june 2014 of 3450000 shares of common stock for 16000 per share and borrowings of 4000 million under the 2014 credit agreement partially offset by the net cash paid for our april 1 2014 acquisition of the apartmentscom business of 5842 million and the 1488 million repayment of the amounts owed under the 2012 credit agreement 

changes in cash and cash equivalents are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable various accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises and similar events 

net cash provided by  operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was 1439 million  compared to 1083 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the 356 million   increase  in net cash provided by  operating activities is primarily due to an increase  of approximately 402 million  from net income plus noncash items partially offset by a net decrease  of approximately 46 million  in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements 

net cash used in  investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was 6060 million  compared to 190 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  this 5870 million   increase  in net cash used in  investing activities in 2014  was primarily due to 5842 million  of cash used for the acquisition of the apartmentscom business on april 1 2014 

net cash provided by  financing activities was 7335 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 104 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  this 7231 million   increase  in net cash provided by  financing activities was primarily due to proceeds of 5500 million  received under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility on april 1 2014 and the 5294 million  in net proceeds from our public equity offering in june 2014 less the 1488 million repayment of amounts owed under the 2012 credit agreement 1500 million repayment of the revolving credit facility associated with the 2014 credit agreement and the 100 million  payment of debt issuance costs associated with the 2014 credit agreement which did not occur during 2013  

  

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2014  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 longterm debt obligations include scheduled principal payments and exclude interest payments which are based on a variable rate of interest as defined in the credit agreement 

2 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less or ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a third party or us amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of 47 million  due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 

during 2014  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 274 million  we expect to make aggregate capital expenditures in 2015  of approximately 300 million to 400 million primarily related to the build out of leased office space 

in conjunction with the launch of the improved apartmentscom website we plan to embark on a widescale marketing campaign commencing during the first quarter of 2015 and running throughout the remainder of 2015 to generate brand awareness and site traffic for apartmentscom including an incremental investment of 750 million above apartmentscom’s 2014 annualized marketing spend since the close of the acquisition of the apartmentscom business 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

on april 1 2014 we purchased the apartmentscom business from cv for a purchase price of 5871 million which was later reduced by approximately 29 million following the final determination of the net working capital of the apartmentscom business as of the closing date on the closing date we entered into the 2014 credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent we funded the purchase price for the apartmentscom business at closing through a combination of cash on hand and the proceeds of the term loan facility and the initial borrowing under the revolving credit facility under the 2014 credit agreement the 2014 credit agreement provides for a 4000 million term loan facility and a 2250 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years the proceeds of the term loan facility and the initial borrowing of 1500 million under the revolving credit facility on the closing date were also used to refinance the term loan facility and revolving credit facility established under the 2012 credit agreement including related fees and expenses the undrawn proceeds of the revolving credit facility are available for our working capital needs and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2014  maturities of our borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement for each of the next five years ended december 31 2015 to 2019 are expected to be 200 million  200 million  350 million  550 million  and 2550 million  respectively during june 2014 we repaid the 1500 million initial borrowing under the revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility includes a subfacility for swingline loans of up to 100 million and up to 100 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit the term loan facility will amortize in quarterly installments in amounts resulting in an annual amortization of 5 during each of the first second and third years 10 during the fourth year and 15 during the fifth year after the closing date with the remainder payable at final maturity the loans under the 2014 credit agreement bear interest at our option either i during any interest period selected by us at the london interbank offered rate for deposits in us dollars with a maturity comparable to such interest period adjusted for statutory reserves “libor” plus an initial spread of 200 per annum subject to adjustment based on our first lien secured leverage ratio as defined in the 2014 credit agreement or ii at the greatest of x the prime rate from time to time announced by jpmorgan chase bank na y the federal funds effective rate plus ½ of 1 and z libor for a onemonth interest period plus 100 plus an initial spread of 100 per annum subject to adjustment based on our first lien secured leverage ratio if an event of default occurs under the 2014 credit agreement the interest rate on overdue amounts will increase by 200 per annum the obligations under the 2014 credit agreement are guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and those of our material subsidiaries in each case subject to certain exceptions pursuant to security and guarantee documents entered into on the closing date 

the 2014 credit agreement requires us to maintain i a first lien secured leverage ratio as defined in the 2014 credit agreement not exceeding 400 to 100 during each full fiscal quarter after the closing date through the three months ended march 31 2016 and 350 to 100 thereafter and ii after the incurrence of additional indebtedness under certain specified exceptions in the 2014 credit agreement a total leverage ratio as defined in the 2014 credit agreement not exceeding 500 to 100 during each full fiscal quarter after the closing date through the three months ended march 31 2016 and 450 to 100 thereafter the 2014 credit agreement also includes other covenants including covenants that subject to certain exceptions restrict our ability to i incur additional indebtedness ii create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv make investments and acquisitions v make certain dispositions of assets vi make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

in connection with obtaining the term loan facility and revolving credit facility pursuant to the 2014 credit agreement we incurred approximately 101 million in debt issuance costs as of april 1 2014 the debt issuance costs were comprised of approximately 97 million in underwriting fees and approximately 400000 primarily related to legal fees associated with the debt issuance approximately 100 million of the fees associated with the refinancing along with the unamortized debt issuance cost from the 2012 credit agreement were capitalized and are amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2014 credit agreement using the effective interest method 

as of december 31 2013  and 2014  no  amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities total interest expense for our term loan facilities and revolving credit facilities was approximately 48 million  69 million  and 105 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  2013  and 2014  respectively interest expense included amortized debt issuance costs of approximately 20 million  30 million  and 33 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  2013  and 2014  respectively total interest paid for the term loan facilities was approximately 25 million  43 million  and 70 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  2013  and 2014  respectively 

in 2012 we granted a total of 399413 shares pursuant to performancebased restricted common stock awards with a forfeiture date of march 31 2017 upon vesting of these awards during the first quarter of 2014 consistent with minimum tax withholding requirements a portion of the shares subject to the awards were remitted by the employees for payment of their individual income tax obligations the shares remitted were canceled and we made a cash tax payment equivalent to the fair market value of the canceled shares of approximately 319 million during the three months ended march 31 2014 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2014  we had 187 million  par value of longterm investments in student loan ars which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the shortterm in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb and international accounting standards board “iasb” jointly issued a new revenue recognition standard that will improve financial reporting by creating common recognition guidance for us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” this guidance provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improves the comparability of revenue recognition practices across industries provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the presentation of financial statements the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is not permitted this guidance permits the use of either a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective approach in which it would be applied only to the most current period presented along with a cumulativeeffect adjustment at the date of adoption we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database approximately 1123  researchers and outside contractors our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 26  years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of january 31 2014  our database of real estate information covered the us london england and other parts of the uk and contained information about 

 

this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as 



costar research 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2013  our full time researchers and contractors drove millions of miles conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections and conducted millions of interviews of brokers owners and tenants 

research department  as of january 31 2014  we had approximately 1123  commercial real estate research professionals and outside contractors performing research our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails and internet updates each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of database information as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers 

costar has an extensive field research effort that includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional property inventory photograph properties and verify existing information costars field research effort also includes creating high quality videos of interior spaces amenities and exterior features of properties costar utilizes 115  hightech field research vehicles across the us canada and the uk a significant majority of these vehicles are customized energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps some of our researchers also use customdesigned trucks with the same equipment as well as pneumatic masts that extend up to an elevation of twentyfive feet to allow for unobstructed building photographs from “birdseye” views each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for sale” or “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite 

data and image providers  we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third party data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and marketing services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems  our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

risk factors 

risks related to our business 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and marketing services our subscriptionbased information analytics and marketing services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

  

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  a reversal of recent improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and marketing services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to more cancellations of our information analytics and marketing services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2014  we plan to continue to increase the depth of our coverage in the us and uk and we expect to expand into additional geographies including toronto canada if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

if we are not able to successfully finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergy created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products potential increases in operating costs managing geographically remote operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential disruptions in ongoing operations during integration the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations further certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval which can be time consuming and costly to obtain and the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses our us researchers use integrated internal research processes to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and marketing services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of and to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and marketing services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together and how we can best address those uses through standalone services or combinations or coordinating applications thereof in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues and reducing our profitability 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in this market may increase further as a result of current recessionary economic conditions as customer bases and customer spending have decreased and service providers are competing for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins over the past few years we have increased the rate of investments in our business including internal investments in product development and sales and marketing to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future as activity in the commercial real estate industry shows signs of economic recovery our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of investments furthermore if the industry fails to stabilize or deteriorates further in 2014  and beyond our investments may not have their intended effect for instance our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and marketing services and could reduce our profitability 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims 

if we fail to protect confidential information against security breaches or if customers or potential customers are reluctant to use our services because of privacy concerns we might face additional costs and could lose customers or potential customers we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses in certain circumstances we also collect and use credit card information our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies we could be subject to legal claims government action or harm to our reputation if our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and marketing services to users 

concern of prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business under various state laws if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that unencrypted personal customer data has been stolen we are required to inform any customers whose data was stolen which could result in significant costs and harm our reputation and business 

in addition certain state laws require businesses that maintain personal information in electronic databases to implement reasonable measures to keep that information secure various states have enacted different and sometimes contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of the different states is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours which collects personal information from customers in multiple jurisdictions 

we may face adverse publicity and loss of consumer confidence if we are not able to comply with laws requiring us to take adequate measures to assure the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information that our customers had given to us this could result in a loss of customers and revenue that could jeopardize our success even if we are in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations we may face liability or disruption of business if we do not comply in every instance or if the security of the customer data that we collect is compromised regardless of whether our practices comply or not if we were required to pay any significant amount of money in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to suspend operations for any length of time due to our inability to comply fully with any such laws our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2013  we had 7186 million  of goodwill 6926 million  in our us segment and 260 million  in our international segment 

as a result of the consolidation of certain of our facilities we may incur additional costs  we have taken and may continue to take actions that may increase our cost structure in the shortterm but are intended to reduce certain portions of our longterm cost structure such as consolidation of office space as a result of consolidation of office space we may reduce our longterm occupancy costs but incur restructuring charges if our longterm cost reduction efforts are ineffective or our estimates of cost savings are inaccurate our profitability could be negatively impacted expected savings from relocating facilities can be highly variable and uncertain further we may not be successful in achieving the operating efficiencies or operating cost reductions expected from these efforts in the amounts or at the times we anticipate 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents and property owners our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to the loopnet marketplace costar showcase landandfarmcom and lands of america could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of commercial real estate property listings submitted by brokers agents and property owners this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including bizbuysell and bizquest are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are used to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale our revenues could be negatively affected 

the number of loopnets registered members is higher than the number of actual members the number of registered members in loopnets network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations or others may have registered under fictitious names given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members and thus we rely on the number of registered members as a measure of the size of the loopnet marketplace if the number of loopnets actual members does not continue to grow and those members do not convert to premium members then the loopnet marketplace business may not grow as fast as we expect which could harm our operating and financial results 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our historic revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a further weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited grecam sas and property and portfolio research ltd a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro if we expand into canada as expected a portion of our business will be denominated in canadian dollars as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our expansion into the commercial real estate analytics sector may not be successful or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the commercial real estate market research and forecasting sector has imposed and may continue to impose additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general management resources during 2014  we expect to continue to expand our presence in the commercial real estate analytics sector if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur additional costs to expand our analytics services and we are not successful in marketing or selling these expanded services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

our indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs   on february 16 2012 we entered into a credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jp morgan bank as administrative agent the credit agreement provides for a 1750 million term loan facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years on april 30 2012 we used the proceeds of the 1750 million term loan facility to fund a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs for the loopnet acquisition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries i to incur additional indebtedness ii to create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii to enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv to make investments and acquisitions v to make certain dispositions of assets vi to make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii to enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be materially affected by events beyond our control if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement if an event of default occurs the lenders under the credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2013  we held 243 million  par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2013  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2013  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 15 million  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2013  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

us political credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact or impair the value of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments including us treasury securities and usbacked investments as well as our access to credit   our cash cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of common financial instruments including us treasury securities deterioration in the us credit and financial markets may result in losses or deterioration in the fair value of our cash cash equivalents or investments on august 5 2011 standard  poor’s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa this downgrade and any future downgrades of the us credit rating could impact the stability of future us treasury auctions affect the trading market for us government securities result in increased interest rates and impair access to credit these factors could negatively impact the liquidity or valuation of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments which may affect our ability to fund future obligations further these factors may result in an increase in interest rates and borrowing costs and make it more difficult to obtain credit on acceptable terms which may affect our ability to fund future obligations and increase the costs of obtaining financing for future obligations 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website the internet and our service providers problems with our website the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and marketing services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our databases computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information analytics and marketing services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services lower revenues and increased costs 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected  the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results in addition our results may be impacted by seasonality the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slow downs during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company    on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to between and among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at wwwftcgov requires costar to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires costar to maintain its customary practice of selling its products separately and on a marketbymarket basis it also requires costar to license its products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition costar is required to maintain its customary licensing practices with respect to the length of its contracts to allow customers with multiyear contracts to cancel with one years advance notice and to agree to reduce the cost of any litigation with customers by offering to arbitrate certain disputes in the event that costar fails or is unable to comply with the terms of the consent order costar could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief further the provisions of the consent order may result in unanticipated adverse effects on the combined company and therefore reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger for example the terms of the consent order that require us to continue to sell our products separately may prohibit us from combining or eliminating certain business lines products or services that we believe will result in a longterm positive impact on our revenue and earnings 

we have incurred and will continue to incur acquisitionrelated costs    we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate prior acquisitions such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains “forwardlooking statements” including statements about our beliefs and expectations there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those stated above in item 1a under the headings “risk factors  cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” and “ risk factors” as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 

all forwardlooking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements  whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

costar group inc the “company” or “costar” is the number one provider of information analytics and marketing services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states us and the united kingdom uk based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available have the largest research department in the industry own and operate the leading online marketplace for commercial real estate in the us based on the number of unique visitors per month provide more information analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors and believe that we generate more revenues than any of our competitors we have created and compiled our standardized information analytics and marketing platform where members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information information about properties for sale tenant information internet marketing services analytical capabilities information for clients websites information about industry professionals and their business relationships data integration and industry news 

loopnet our subsidiary operates an online marketplace that enables property owners landlords and commercial real estate agents working on their behalf to list properties for sale or for lease and to submit detailed information about property listings commercial real estate agents buyers and tenants also use loopnets online marketplace to search for available property listings that meet their criteria 

we also provide market research and analysis for commercial real estate investors and lenders via our property and portfolio research “ppr” service offerings portfolio and debt management and reporting capabilities through our resolve technology service offerings and real estate and lease management solutions including lease administration and abstraction services through our virtual premise service offerings 

our service offerings span all commercial property types including office industrial retail land mixeduse hospitality and multifamily 

subscriptionbased services 

our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar suite tm  and focus tm services costar suite is sold as a platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional® costar comps professional® and costar tenant® and through our mobile application costargo® costar suite is our primary service offering in our us operating segment focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment additionally we introduced costar suite in the uk in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no longer offered focus to new clients beginning in 2013 

our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of similar services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscriptionbased license agreements that renew automatically a majority of which have a term of one year upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased information services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the clients business focus geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 

as of december 31 2012  and 2013  our annualized net new sales of subscriptionbased services on annual contracts were approximately 109 million  and 158 million  respectively calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from new annual subscriptionbased contracts or upsales on existing annual subscriptionbased contracts less write downs and cancellations for the period reported we recognize subscription revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2012  and 2013  our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscriptionbased services was approximately 94  and 93  respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 6  and 7  respectively for the same time periods our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if among other reasons negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

expansion and development 

we expect to continue software development to improve existing services introduce new services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations we are committed to supporting and improving our existing core information news analytic and marketing services 

in october 2013 we introduced technology enhancements to costar suite our platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional costar comps professional and costar tenant the enhancements improve costar suites user interface search functionality and analytic capabilities the newly introduced costar multifamily tm  information search allows access to our extensive multifamily property database in addition we introduced costar lease analysis tm  an integrated workflow tool that provides users a simple way to produce understandable cash flows for any proposed or existing lease we will continue software development on our new lease analysis workflow tool throughout 2014 we believe this greater functionality will make our services valuable to an even broader audience and help us increase sales of our services to brokers banks owners and institutional investors further these technology enhancements are expected to drive continued revenue growth in 2014 and for the foreseeable future we expect additional selling and marketing activities to promote our new service enhancements will result in increased expenses in 2014 

in october 2013 we also released costargo® 20 the next generation of our mobile application which was launched in the us on august 15 2011 and introduced in the uk on november 5 2012 costargo is our ipad application that integrates and provides costar suite subscribers mobile access to our comprehensive property tenant and comparable sales information costargo 20 adds powerful analytic capabilities to our comprehensive mobile solution 

we have introduced enhancements to our flagship marketing platform loopnetcom for example we added a broker advertising service that allows brokers to purchase advertisements based on geographic and property type criteria additionally we introduced provideo a service that enables owners and brokers to enhance their listings with high quality videos of interior spaces amenities and exterior features we expect to continue software development to improve the loopnet marketing platform in 2014 

we continue to integrate develop and crosssell the services offered by the companies we acquired including loopnet virtual premise resolve technology and ppr in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry needs we may decide or may have previously decided to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer 

our sales and marketing efforts have focused and will continue to focus on crossselling and marketing our services we recently implemented an automatic crossselling initiative within the loopnet marketplace as searchers view properties within the loopnet marketplace a message may appear indicating that there are additional listings available within costar suite with the same search criteria that they are not able to access under their current subscription the message provides contact information so that the customer can reach their customer service or sales representative and review the most appropriate service for their needs our goal is to upsell clients to the services that best meet their needs and to create further crossselling revenue synergies in addition we have added a comparison feature to costargo which allows our sales force to demonstrate how many more properties a prospect could see with respect to a particular search area if that prospect were using costar suite rather than the prospect’s current subscription with loopnet 

our revenues have increased as a result of the loopnet merger and prior acquisitions due to revenue from the acquired businesses and from crossselling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies as a result of cross selling costars and loopnets complementary services we began to achieve increased revenue synergies in 2013 we also incurred increased expenses associated with the related marketing and sales campaign in 2012 and during the first half of 2013 these initiatives resulted in revenue growth and we expect they will continue to position the company for revenue growth during 2014 and for the foreseeable future 

we continue to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us we intend to continue to upgrade the platform of services and expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment to further develop those initiatives we introduced costar suite in the uk during the fourth quarter of 2012 and no longer offered focus to new clients beginning in 2013 costar suite is sold as a consistent international platform of service offerings consisting of costar property professional costar comps professional and costar tenant and through the companys mobile application costargo costargo 20 was released in the uk in october 2013 simultaneous with the release in the us additionally we have upgraded our backend research operations fulfillment and customer relationship management “crm” systems to support these new uk services in order to implement these services in the uk we incurred increased development costs through 2012 however development costs incurred by the international segment decreased in 2013 the international operating segment continues to experience improved financial performance and most recently during the three months ended december 31 2013  international ebitda increased to a positive amount as a result of increased revenue and decreased operating expenses 

in 2014 we expect to expand further internationally by offering our services in toronto canada we believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services including expansion of our existing service offerings internationally have created a platform for longterm revenue growth we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our international subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling of our services to customers in existing markets 

we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in addition to the investments discussed above in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings in 2014  and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future further our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow which may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business 

market conditions 

in general the current economic recovery has been slower than past economic recoveries job growth in particular has recovered more slowly than in past economic recoveries and as a result the improvement in the commercial real estate industry has been slower especially with respect to the rental rate growth continuing nearterm risks related to lowerthanexpected job growth government fiscal challenges and uncertainty over us and global economic issues may impede the ability and willingness of clients to purchase services from us or result in reductions of services purchased additionally since many of our clients use debt to finance a portion of their real estate purchases material changes in interest rates and risk premiums could harm their ability to complete transactions especially if the change was relatively rapid and unexpected 

  

as is typical of this point in the economic cycle business consolidations and in some circumstances business failures continue to occur if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business including competitors that offer rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information if customers choose to cancel our services because of cost cutting desire to access real estate information through other delivery methods or other reasons our revenue could decline 

financial matters 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods currency exchange rate volatility may continue which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and periodtoperiod comparisons of our consolidated operations 

we currently issue stock options andor restricted stock to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations the amount and timing of the compensation expense that we record depends on the amount and types of equity grants made we plan to continue to use stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 

in february 2012 the compensation committee the “committee” of the board of directors approved grants of restricted common stock to our executive officers that vest based on the achievement of costar performance conditions specifically these shares of performancebased restricted common stock vest upon our achievement of 900 million of cumulative net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters and are subject to forfeiture in the event the foregoing performance condition is not met by march 31 2017 these awards support the committee’s goals of aligning executive incentives with longterm stockholder value and ensuring that executive officers have a continuing stake in the longterm success of costar in may and december of 2012 we granted additional shares of restricted common stock that vest based on the achievement of the same performance conditions to other key employees we granted a total of 399413  shares of performancebased restricted common stock during the year ended december 31 2012  there was no  performancebased restricted common stock granted during the year ended december 31 2013  all of the awards were made under the costar group inc 2007 stock incentive plan and pursuant to our standard form of restricted stock grant agreement the number of shares granted was based on the fair market value of costar’s common stock on the grant date as of march 31 2013 we initially determined that it was probable that the performance condition for these performancebased restricted common stock awards would be met by the march 31 2017 forfeiture date as of december 31 2013  we reassessed the probability of achieving this performance condition and determined that it was still probable that the performance condition for these awards would be met by the march 31 2017 forfeiture date subject to certain approvals under the costar group inc 2007 stock incentive plan as a resultwe recorded a total of approximately 218 million  of stockbased compensation expense related to performancebased restricted common stock for the year ended december 31 2013  there was no  stockbased compensation expense related to performancebased restricted common stock recorded for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2012  

property developments 

as in the past we expect to continue to identify new facilities and consolidate existing facilities to better accommodate the changing demands of our business and employees as a result we may incur additional lease restructuring charges for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities “ars” whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2013  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of contractual cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period 

the only significant unobservable input in the discounted cash flow model is the discount rate the discount rate used represents our estimate of the yield expected by a market participant from the ars investments the weighted average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2012  and 2013  was approximately 51  and 49  respectively selecting another discount rate within the range used in the discounted cash flow model would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the ars 

based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2013  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 15 million  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2013  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

stockbased compensation 

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of our stock price for equity instruments that vest based on performance we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability of whether the performance conditions would be met if our initial estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions change the related stockbased compensation expense and timing of recognition may fluctuate from period to period based on those estimates if the performance conditions are not met no stockbased compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized stockbased compensation expense will be reversed 

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation as of october 1 2013 that revenues will increase as a result of further penetration of our international subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2013 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2013 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the quantitative impairment test similar to the test performed on goodwill discussed above 

as of october 1 2013 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded the carrying value there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2013 that would indicate that the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share also referred to as nongaap eps ebitda is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 26 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and marketing services which has included acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs and restructuring costs adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are purchase amortization and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2011  we assumed a 40 tax rate and in 2012  and 2013  we assumed a 38 tax rate in order to approximate our longterm effective corporate tax rate 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

interest and other expense  interest and other expense increased  to 69 million  in 2013  compared to 48 million  in 2012  the increase  was due to the additional interest expense incurred in 2013  compared to 2012  resulting from the 1750 million borrowed under the term loan facility on april 30 2012 and used to fund a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs for the loopnet acquisition 

income tax expense net  income tax expense net increased  to 178 million  in 2013  from 132 million  in 2012  this increase  was primarily due to higher income before income taxes in 2013 as a result of our increased profitability partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in 2013 the higher effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily due to costs related to the loopnet acquisition that reduced income from operations but were not deductible for tax purposes

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

the following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues certain previously reported amounts in the condensed consolidated statements of operations have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation 





  

recent acquisitions 

loopnet  on april 30 2012 we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of loopnet pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated april 27 2011 as amended may 20 2011 the “merger agreement” we paid approximately 7464 million  in cash and approximately 1371 million  in equity for a total consideration of 8834 million  

accounting treatment  we have applied the acquisition method to account for the loopnet transaction which requires that among other things assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date the purchase price was allocated to trade names customer base database technology goodwill and various other asset and liability accounts the acquired trade names recorded in connection with the loopnet acquisition have an indefinite estimated useful life and are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests the acquired customer base for the acquisition which consists of one distinct intangible asset and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on an accelerated basis related to the expected economic benefit of the intangible asset over the estimated useful life the acquired database technology for the acquisition is amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life goodwill for the acquisition is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of loopnet have been consolidated with those of the company since the date of the acquisition see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further details on the loopnet acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and debt from our term loan and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents were 2560 million  at december 31 2013  compared to cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1561 million  at december 31 2012  the increase  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities of 1083 million  

changes in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable various accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises purchases and sales of shortterm investments and similar events 

net cash provided by  operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was 1083 million  compared to 861 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the 222 million   increase  in net cash provided by  operating activities is primarily due to an increase  of approximately 125 million  from net income plus noncash items as well as a net increase  of approximately 97 million  in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements 

net cash used in  investing activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was 190 million  compared to 6404 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  this 6214 million   decrease  in net cash used in  investing activities in 2013  was primarily due to 6409 million  of cash used for the acquisition of loopnet on april 30 2012 partially offset by a decrease  in the proceeds from the sale and settlements of investments of approximately 153 million  

net cash provided by  financing activities was 104 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 1649 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  this 1545 million   decrease  in net cash provided by  financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds of 1750 million  received from the term loan facility on april 30 2012 less payments of debt issuance costs of 115 million  associated with the debt which did not occur in 2013 

  

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2013  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 longterm debt obligations include scheduled principal payments and exclude interest payments which are based on a variable rate of interest as defined in the credit agreement 

2 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less or ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a third party or us amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of 48 million  due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 

during 2013  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 190 million  we expect to make aggregate capital expenditures in 2014  of approximately 180 million to 230 million primarily related to the build out of leased office space 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

on april 30 2012 we acquired loopnet pursuant to the merger agreement prior to completion of the loopnet acquisition on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted a consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to by costar and loopnet the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at wwwftcgov required among other things that costar and loopnet divest loopnets minority interest in xceligent on march 28 2012 costar and loopnet entered into a purchase agreement to sell loopnets interest in xceligent to dmgi the parties closed the sale of loopnets interest in xceligent to dmgi on may 3 2012 we received 42 million in proceeds from the sale which reflected the fair value of the investment at the time of sale and did not result in any gain on the sale of the investment 

we funded the cash portion of the consideration payable to loopnet stockholders in the merger through a combination of cash on hand including the net proceeds of approximately 2479 million from an equity offering we completed in june 2011 and 1750 million in proceeds from a term loan facility pursuant to the credit agreement dated february 16 2012 by and among costar as borrower costar realty as coborrower jp morgan bank as administrative agent and the other lenders thereto in addition to the 1750 million term loan facility the credit agreement provides for a 500 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years we made principal payments of approximately 44 million  and 175 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2013  respectively as of december 31 2013  maturities of our borrowings under the credit agreement for each of the next four years ended december 31 2014 to 2017 are expected to be 241 million  328 million  613 million  and 350 million  respectively 

the credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt service coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of at least 15 to 10 and a total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement that does not exceed 275 to 100 during each of the three months ending december 31 2013 march 31 2014 and june 30 2014 and 250 to 100 thereafter the credit agreement also includes other covenants that were effective as of april 30 2012 including covenants that subject to certain exceptions restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries i to incur additional indebtedness ii to create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii to enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv to make investments and acquisitions v to make certain dispositions of assets vi to make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii to enter into certain transactions with affiliates we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement as of december 31 2013  

commencing with the fiscal year ending december 31 2012 the credit agreement requires us to make an annual prepayment of the term loan facility equal to a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility the prepayment percentage is 50 when the total leverage ratio exceeds 300 to 100 25 when the total leverage ratio is greater than 250 to 100 but equal to or less than 300 to 100 and 0 when the total leverage ratio is equal to or less than 250 to 100 this prepayment requirement is reduced by the amount of prior voluntary prepayments during the respective fiscal year subject to certain exceptions set forth in the credit agreement the excess cash flow payment if required is due within ten business days of the date on which the annual financial statements are delivered or required to be delivered to the lenders pursuant to the credit agreement for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013  we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment 

in connection with obtaining the term loan facility we incurred approximately 115 million in debt issuance costs which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the credit agreement using the effective interest method the debt issuance costs are comprised of approximately 92 million in underwriting fees and approximately 23 million primarily related to legal fees associated with the debt issuance 

as of december 31 2012  and 2013  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility total interest expense for the term loan facility was approximately 0  48 million  and 69 million  for the years ended december 31 2011  2012  and 2013  respectively interest expense included amortized debt issuance costs of approximately 0  20 million  and 30 million  for the years ended december 31 2011  2012  and 2013  respectively pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement we are required to make interest payments on the term loan facility at a variable rate of interest and during interest periods selected by us as described in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k total interest paid for the term loan facility was approximately 0  25 million  and 43 million  for the years ended december 31 2011  2012  and 2013  respectively 

in 2012 we granted a total of 399413 shares pursuant to performancebased restricted common stock awards with a forfeiture date of march 31 2017 upon vesting of these awards consistent with tax minimum withholding requirements a portion of the shares subject to the awards will be remitted by the employees for payment of their individual income tax obligations the shares remitted will be canceled and we will make a cash tax payment equivalent to the canceled shares currently estimated to be approximately 300 million this amount is based on several assumptions including the estimated stock price at the time of vesting as well as the individual minimum withholding rates for the employees if the actual stock price and individual tax rates differ from these estimates the cash payment may change 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2013  we had 243 million  par value of longterm investments in student loan ars which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the shortterm in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 

  

as more fully described in note 11 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on january 3 2012 loopnet our wholly owned subsidiary was sued by civixddi llc “civix” for alleged patent infringement and on or about may 14 2012 civix filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint against loopnet seeking to add costar as a defendant alleging that our products also infringe civixs patents the complaint seeks unspecified damages attorneys fees and costs on june 21 2012 we filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity against civix we amended this complaint on august 14 2012 to assert an affirmative claim against civix for breach of contract alleging civix violated its license agreement and covenant not to sue with one of our technology licensors on november 25 2013 civix submitted its expert’s report of damages which estimated the payment it deemed appropriate in the event that we are found liable of infringement we believe that civix’s calculation of damages is based on improper assumptions and miscalculations and is otherwise unsupported we submitted our own expert’s report of damages which concluded that the appropriate payment to be made in the event that we are found liable of infringement is significantly less than civix’s estimate of appropriate damages moreover our experts report of damages concluded that while civix’s calculation of damages was fundamentally flawed and should not be used to determine damages simply applying certain necessary adjustments to civixs calculation as outlined in our experts report resulted in a significant reduction in civix’s calculation of damages to approximately 37 million on november 5 2013 we offered to settle all outstanding litigation with civix for 600000 at this time we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation with civix but we intend to vigorously defend against civix’s claims while we believe we have meritorious defenses against civix’s claims we estimate that based on our adjusted calculation of civix’s alleged damages the matter could result in a loss of up to 31 million in excess of the amount accrued

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 



the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database approximately 1108  researchers and outside contractors our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 25  years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of january 31 2013  our database of real estate information covered the us london england and other parts of the uk and contained information about 

 

this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as 



costar research 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2012 our full time researchers and contractors drove millions of miles conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections and conducted millions of interviews of brokers owners and tenants 

research department  as of january 31 2013  we had approximately 1108  commercial real estate research professionals and outside contractors performing research our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails internet updates and faxes each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of database information as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers 

costar has an extensive field research effort that includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional inventory photograph properties and verify existing information 

costar utilizes 137  hightech field research vehicles in 39  states canada and the uk of these vehicles 120  are customized energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps some of our researchers also use customdesigned trucks with the same equipment as well as pneumatic masts that extend up to an elevation of twentyfive feet to allow for unobstructed building photographs from “birdseye” views each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for sale” or “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite in addition many of our field researchers are photographers who take photographs of commercial real estate properties to add to costar’s database of digital images 

data and image providers  we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third party data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information analytics and marketing services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems  our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include 

 

finally one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day 

proprietary technology 

as of january 31 2013  costar had a staff of 295  product development database and network professionals costar’s information technology professionals focus on developing new services for our customers integrating our current services and delivering research automation tools that improve the quality of our data and increase the efficiency of our research analysts

the market for information analytics and marketing services generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate industry the principal competitive factors for commercial real estate information analytics and marketing services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the commercial real estate information analytics and marketing services marketplace develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could easily enter the commercial real estate marketing arena while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

risks related to our business 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information analytics and marketing services our subscriptionbased information analytics and marketing services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

  

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  a reversal of recent improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information analytics and marketing services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to more cancellations of our information analytics and marketing services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses our us researchers use integrated internal research processes to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2013  we plan to continue to increase the depth of our coverage in the us and uk and we may expand into additional geographies including toronto canada if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information analytics and marketing services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of and to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to changes in the industry as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information analytics and marketing services developing new services and upgrades to services as well as integrating and coordinating current services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers the processes are costly and our efforts to develop integrate and enhance our services may not be successful as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together and how we can best address those uses through standalone services or combinations or coordinating applications thereof in addition successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine shift focus from or phase out a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues and reducing our profitability 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in this market may increase further as a result of current recessionary economic conditions as customer bases and customer spending have decreased and service providers are competing for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins in 2011 and 2012 we increased the rate of investments in our business including internal investments in product development and sales and marketing to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers in 2011 and 2012 we also acquired virtual premise and loopnet respectively our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future as activity in the commercial real estate industry shows signs of economic recovery while we believe this strategy will enable us to capitalize on opportunities we see in our industry and extend our leadership position we expect our operating margins to experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of our investments furthermore if the industry fails to stabilize or deteriorates further in 2013  and beyond our investments may not have their intended effect for instance our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergy created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland grecam sas in france costar uk limited propex and property and portfolio research ltd in the uk the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations 

the failure to successfully integrate loopnets business and operations andor fully realize expected synergies from the merger in the expected time frame or at all may adversely affect our future results and our business the success of the loopnet merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate loopnets business and operations and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining our business and loopnets business including anticipated growth opportunities and cost savings we may not be able to achieve these objectives in whole or in part any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our revenues expenses and operating results 

the success of the merger will also depend in part on our ability to minimize or eliminate any difficulties that may occur in connection with the integration of our business and loopnets business the integration process could result in the loss of key employees loss of key clients loss of key vendors and other business partners increases in operating costs increases in taxes increases in regulatory compliance costs or the disruption of each companys ongoing businesses any or all of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of the merger our efforts to integrate the two companies will divert managements attention and other resources from uses that could otherwise have been beneficial to the company in addition management may decide to combine eliminate or shift focus away from business lines products or services if management believes those changes will have an accretive impact on our earnings per share but any such changes could have a negative impact on revenue and earnings in the short or longterm further the terms of the ftcs consent order may prohibit us from taking actions we may wish to take as part of the integration such as combining or eliminating certain existing business lines products or services that we believe will result in a longterm positive impact on our revenue and earnings 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information analytics and marketing services and could reduce our profitability 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims 

if we fail to protect confidential information against security breaches or if customers or potential customers are reluctant to use our services because of privacy concerns we might face additional costs and could lose customers or potential customers we collect use and disclose personally identifiable information including among other things names addresses phone numbers and email addresses in certain circumstances we also collect and use credit card information our policies concerning the collection use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies we could be subject to legal claims government action or harm to our reputation if our practices fail or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information 

concern of prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services industrywide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites including misappropriation of thirdparty information security breaches or changes in industry standards regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information which could harm our business under various state laws if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that unencrypted personal customer data has been stolen we are required to inform any customers whose data was stolen which could result in significant costs and harm our reputation and business 

in addition certain state laws require businesses that maintain personal information in electronic databases to implement reasonable measures to keep that information secure various states have enacted different and sometimes contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of the different states is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours which collects personal information from customers in multiple jurisdictions 

we may face adverse publicity and loss of consumer confidence if we are not able to comply with laws requiring us to take adequate measures to assure the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information that our customers had given to us this could result in a loss of customers and revenue that could jeopardize our success even if we are in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations we may face liability or disruption of business if we do not comply in every instance or if the security of the customer data that we collect is compromised regardless of whether our practices comply or not if we were required to pay any significant amount of money in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to suspend operations for any length of time due to our inability to comply fully with any such laws our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2012  we had 7181 million  of goodwill 6926 million  in our us segment and 255 million  in our international segment 

as a result of the consolidation of certain of our facilities we may incur additional costs  we have taken and may continue to take actions that may increase our cost structure in the shortterm but are intended to reduce certain portions of our longterm cost structure such as consolidation of office space as a result of consolidation of office space we may reduce our longterm occupancy costs but incur restructuring charges if our longterm cost reduction efforts are ineffective or our estimates of cost savings are inaccurate our profitability could be negatively impacted expected savings from relocating facilities can be highly variable and uncertain further we may not be successful in achieving the operating efficiencies or operating cost reductions expected from these efforts in the amounts or at the times we anticipate 

we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies in addition “copycat” websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even if we could technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations in some cases particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the us our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 

if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers agents and property owners our commercial real estate cre marketplace services including but not limited to the loopnet marketplace costar showcase landandfarmcom and lands of america could be less attractive to current or potential customers which could reduce our revenues the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of commercial real estate property listings submitted by brokers agents and property owners this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search listing and marketing services if agents marketing large numbers of property listings such as large brokers in key real estate markets choose not to continue their listings with us or choose to list them with a competitor our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants resulting in reduced revenue similarly the value and utility of our other marketplaces including bizbuysell and bizquest are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings 

if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing searching and marketing commercial real estate they could choose not to use those services which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community many commercial real estate professionals are used to listing searching and marketing real estate in traditional and offline ways such as by distributing print brochures sharing written lists placing signs on properties wordofmouth and newspaper advertisements commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services which could negatively impact our business similarly if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale our revenues could be negatively affected 

the number of loopnets registered members is higher than the number of actual members the number of registered members in loopnets network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations or others may have registered under fictitious names given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members and thus we rely on the number of registered members as a measure of the size of the loopnet marketplace if the number of loopnets actual members does not continue to grow and those members do not convert to premium members then the loopnet marketplace business may not grow as fast as we expect which could harm our operating and financial results 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel our ability to effectively structure our sales force and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase see “ we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger”  for a discussion of the impact the merger with loopnet may have on our ability to attract retain and motivate members of our sales force 

  

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees see “ we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger”  for a discussion of the impact the merger with loopnet may have on our ability to attract retain and motivate members of our management and operating personnel 

we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger    uncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and loopnet employees may have an adverse effect on the combined business this uncertainty may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel as an incentive to remain employed by loopnet and to assist with the integration and ongoing operations of costar and loopnet we agreed to pay retention bonuses to certain key loopnet employees most of those retention bonuses were paid in 2012 others are payable if the respective employee remains an employee in good standing through april 30 2013 we may have greater difficulty retaining those loopnet personnel after they have earned their retention bonuses if our key employees or loopnets key employees depart we may incur significant costs in identifying hiring training and retaining replacements for departing employees which could reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

  

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our historic revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a further weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited spn grecam sas propex and property and portfolio research ltd a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro if we expand into canada as expected a portion of our business will be denominated in canadian dollars as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our expansion into the commercial real estate analytics sector may not be successful or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the commercial real estate market research and forecasting arena imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general management resources during 2013 we expect to continue to expand our presence in the commercial real estate analytics sector if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur additional costs to expand our analytics services and we are not successful in marketing or selling these expanded services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information analytics and marketing services to users 

our indebtedness following the completion of the merger could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs   prior to the merger neither costar nor loopnet had outstanding bank indebtedness    on february 16 2012 we entered into a credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jp morgan bank as administrative agent the credit agreement provides for a 1750 million term loan facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years on april 30 2012 we used the proceeds of the 1750 million term loan facility to fund a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs for the loopnet acquisition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries i to incur additional indebtedness ii to create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii to enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv to make investments and acquisitions v to make certain dispositions of assets vi to make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii to enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be materially affected by events beyond our control if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all or on favorable terms 

we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement if an event of default occurs the lenders under the credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2012  we held 244 million  par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2012  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2012  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 19 million  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2012  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

us political credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact or impair the value of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments including us treasury securities and usbacked investments as well as our access to credit   our cash cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of common financial instruments including us treasury securities deterioration in the us credit and financial markets may result in losses or deterioration in the fair value of our cash cash equivalents or investments on august 5 2011 standard  poor’s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa this downgrade and any future downgrades of the us credit rating could impact the stability of future us treasury auctions affect the trading market for us government securities result in increased interest rates and impair access to credit these factors could negatively impact the liquidity or valuation of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments which may affect our ability to fund future obligations further these factors may result in an increase in interest rates and borrowing costs and make it more difficult to obtain credit on acceptable terms which may affect our ability to fund future obligations and increase the costs of obtaining financing for future obligations 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website the internet and our service providers problems with our website the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and marketing services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information analytics and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information analytics and marketing services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information analytics and marketing services lower revenues and increased costs 

our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected  the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions economic cycles annual seasonality factors and many other factors which in turn may impact our financial results the market is large and fragmented the different sectors of the industry such as office industrial retail multifamily and others are influenced differently by different factors and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing as such it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from yeartoyear on our overall operating results in addition our results may be impacted by seasonality the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods particularly slow downs during the endofyear holiday period and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period if we are unable to adequately respond to economic seasonal or cyclical conditions our revenues expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question andor future periods or cause our stock price to decline in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company    on april 26 2012 the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to between and among the ftc staff costar and loopnet on april 17 2012 the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at wwwftcgov requires costar to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are procompetitive for example the consent order requires costar to maintain its customary practice of selling its products separately and on a marketbymarket basis it also requires costar to license its products to customers who have bought its competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis in addition costar is required to maintain its customary licensing practices with respect to the length of its contracts to allow customers with multiyear contracts to cancel with one years advance notice and to agree to reduce the cost of any litigation with customers by offering to arbitrate certain disputes in the event that costar fails or is unable to comply with the terms of the consent order costar could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines andor injunctive relief further the provisions of the consent order may result in unanticipated adverse effects on the combined company and therefore reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger for example the terms of the consent order that require us to continue to sell our products separately may prohibit us from combining or eliminating certain business lines products or services that we believe will result in a longterm positive impact on our revenue and earnings 

we have incurred and will continue to incur acquisitionrelated costs    we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate the two companies businesses such as it integration expenses costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements retention costs and further severance costs costs in connection with the merger and integration may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisitionrelated costs these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

our business relationships including client relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger    the combined companys business relationships may be subject to disruption as clients of costar andor loopnet and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the combined company these disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of the combined business 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock

as a result of the evolving nature of our business and our acquisition of loopnet on april 30 2012 the companys global industry classification standard gics code was reassigned by standard  poors as internet software  services therefore we now use the sp 500 internet software  services index instead of the sp 500 application software index presented in prior years as an industry index for comparison against our total return in general a comparable sp 500 index may change whenever there is a major corporate action sec rules require that if an index is selected which is different from the index used in the immediately preceding fiscal year the total return must be compared with both the newly selected index and the index used in the prior year as a result a comparison of our total return to that of the sp 500 internet software  services index and the sp 500 application software index is presented below we believe that the sp 500 internet software  services index is an appropriate index to compare us with other companies in our industry and that it is a widely recognized and used index for which components and total return information are readily accessible to our stockholders to assist in their understanding of our performance relative to other companies in our industry 

the comparison covers the period beginning december 31 2007  and ending on december 31 2012  and assumes the reinvestment of any dividends you should note that this performance is historical and is not necessarily indicative of future price performance

expansion and development 

we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services improve existing services integrate products and services crosssell existing services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research sales and marketing organizations we are also committed to supporting and improving our existing core information analytic and marketing services 

examples of new tools and services that we are currently developing and expect to introduce to customers in the near future include upgrades to our suite of online service offerings – costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional these upgrades are expected to include improvements to the search functionality as well as improvements to the reporting capabilities of the system we also plan improvements to property type specific searches included as part of costar property professional 

we continue to improve our mobile application costargo ®  which was launched in the us on august 15 2011 and introduced in the uk on november 5 2012 costargo is our ipad application that integrates and provides mobile access to subscribers of our comprehensive property tenant and comparable sales information from our suite of online service offerings  costar property professional ®  costar tenant ®  and costar comps professional ®  planned improvements for costargo include a multifamily search function and enhanced analytic capabilities 

we are also integrating developing and crossselling the services offered by the companies we acquired most recently including loopnet virtual premise resolve technology and ppr our sales and marketing efforts are and will continue to be focused on crossselling and marketing our services after the acquisition of loopnet we launched a sales and marketing campaign directed at crossselling costars information services to loopnet customers and loopnets marketing services to costar customers we have incurred increased expenses associated with this marketing and sales campaign and expect to continue to incur additional expenses for the campaign during the first quarter of 2013 in some cases when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry needs we may decide to combine shift focus from deemphasize phase out or eliminate a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer 

we anticipate that these initiatives will position the company for revenue growth in 2013 and beyond our investments in loopnet virtual premise resolve technology and ppr have increased and may continue to increase however our revenues have also increased as a result of these acquisitions due to revenue from the acquired businesses as well as our ability to take advantage of crossselling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies 

in addition we expect to continue our efforts to integrate the combined capabilities of costars property and marketlevel information and pprs analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technologys real estate investment software expertise we plan to continue efforts to integrate costars business with virtual premises real estate and lease management solutions these integration efforts include providing additional tools that make our research and analytics even more valuable to subscribers in order to implement these initiatives we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs we also expect to continue to offer our core products and services individually 

in addition we intend to continue to upgrade the platform of services and expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us in furtherance of those initiatives in the uk during the fourth quarter of 2012 we introduced a consistent international platform of service offerings consisting of costargo our ipad application costar property professional costar comps professional and costar tenant we believe the product launch was well received and a significant marketing and sales effort is currently underway previously as part of our integration efforts in 2007 we introduced the “costar group” as the brand encompassing our international operations and in early 2010 we launched showcase our internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals high quality internet lead generation in the uk additionally we have upgraded our backend research operations fulfillment and customer relationship management “crm” systems to support these new uk services in order to implement these services in the uk we incurred increased development costs through 2012 we expect that development expenses incurred by the international segment will decrease in 2013 

in late 2013 or early 2014 we expect to expand further internationally by offering services in toronto canada we believe that our continued investments in us and international products internationalization of our us products and integration efforts have created and will continue to build upon a platform for longterm revenue growth we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our international subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling of our services to customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings 

any future product development or expansion of services combination and coordination of services or elimination of services could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings throughout 2013 and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments or changes to our service offerings could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

loopnet acquisition   

on april 30 2012 we completed the acquisition of loopnet which is included within our us operating segment the acquisition combines the research capabilities of costar with the marketing solutions offered by loopnet we expect the acquisition will create efficiencies in operations and provide greater tools for the combined companys customers to acquire loopnet we paid stock and cash consideration with an aggregate value of approximately 8834 million as of the closing date 

we funded the cash portion of the consideration payable to loopnet stockholders in the merger through a combination of cash on hand including the net proceeds of approximately 2479 million from an equity offering we completed in june 2011 and the proceeds of a 1750 million term loan facility available to us under a credit agreement as amended the “credit agreement” dated february 16 2012 by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc “costar realty” as coborrower jpmorgan chase bank na “jp morgan bank” as administrative agent and the other lenders thereto 

the loopnet transaction was subject to customary closing conditions including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act of 1976 the “hsr act” on april 26 2012 the federal trade commission the “ftc” accepted a consent order in connection with the loopnet merger previously agreed to by loopnet and costar the consent order was subject to a 30day public comment period and on august 29 2012 the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 

the consent order which is publicly available on the ftcs website at wwwftcgov requires us to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes will promote competition for example the consent order requires us to maintain our customary practice of selling our products separately and on a marketbymarket basis it also requires us to license our products to customers who have bought our competitors products on a nondiscriminatory basis which we have always done in the past in addition we are required to maintain our customary licensing practices with respect to the length of our contracts to allow customers with multiyear contracts to cancel with one years advance notice and to agree to reduce the cost of any litigation with customers by offering to arbitrate certain disputes 

we plan to continue to assess any plans for additional investments in our business in the foreseeable future at this time as discussed above we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services within our current platform while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable providing substantial cash flow for our business the costs associated with our merger with loopnet and the integration of our two businesses has reduced our profitability and caused us to generate losses in the second quarter of 2012 further our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow which may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business 

market conditions 

we continue to see clear signs of improving conditions in the commercial real estate industry including falling vacancy rates and positive net absorption in the four main types of property that we track office industrial retail and apartments however the extent and duration of continued improvement in the economy and the commercial real estate industry is unknown further the current economic recovery has been slower than past economic recoveries job growth in particular has recovered more slowly than in past economic recoveries improvements in the commercial real estate industry are largely dependent upon employment trends which drive demand for real estate space continuing risks related to lower than expected job growth government fiscal challenges and uncertainty over us and global economic issues may impede the ability and willingness of clients to purchase services from us or result in reductions of services purchased 

in some cases the business operations of some of our clients continue to be negatively affected by challenging economic conditions in the us and the world resulting at times in business consolidations and in some circumstances business failure if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates we compete against many other commercial real estate information analytics and marketing service providers for business if customers choose to cancel our services for costcutting or other reasons our revenue could decline 

financial matters 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods currency exchange rate volatility may continue which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and periodtoperiod comparisons of our consolidated operations 

we currently issue stock options andor restricted stock to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations the amount and timing of the compensation expense that we record depends on the amount and types of equity grants made we plan to continue the use of stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 

in february 2012 the compensation committee the “committee” of the board of directors approved grants of restricted common stock to our executive officers that vest based on the achievement of costar performance conditions these awards support the committee’s goals of aligning executive incentives with longterm stockholder value and ensuring that executive officers have a continuing stake in the longterm success of costar in may and december of 2012 we granted additional shares of restricted common stock that vest based on the achievement of costar performance conditions to other employees these shares of performancebased restricted common stock vest upon our achievement of 900 million of cumulative ebitda over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters and are subject to forfeiture in the event the foregoing performance condition is not met by march 31 2017 we granted a total of 399413  shares of performancebased restricted common stock during the year ended december 31 2012  representing a total estimated unrecognized stockbased compensation expense of approximately 240 million  all of the awards were made under the costar group inc 2007 stock incentive plan and pursuant to our standard form of restricted stock grant agreement the number of shares granted was based on the fair market value of costar’s common stock on the grant date as of december 31 2012 we determined that it was not probable that the performance condition would be met by the march 31 2017 forfeiture date and therefore we recorded no expense related to the performancebased restricted common stock grants during 2012  however we reassess the probability of the achievement of the performance condition at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability as to whether or not the performance condition would be met if we determine at a future date that achievement of the performance condition is probable we will record stockbased compensation expense related to the performancebased restricted common stock grants over the implied service period 

property developments 

on february 5 2010 we took advantage of favorable market conditions and purchased an office building in downtown washington dc for 4125 million for use as our new headquarters and have since relocated to this location the “dc office building” the lease for our previous headquarters in bethesda md expired on october 15 2010 therefore we incurred overlapping occupancy costs through the end of the bethesda lease term as we transitioned to our new headquarters we were able to create value through our occupancy of the dc office building and on february 18 2011 sold the building for aggregate consideration of 1010 million 150 million of which was designated to fund additional buildout and planned improvements at the building approximately 125 million of the 150 million additional buildout is recorded as a leasehold improvement in property and equipment as part of the sale we entered into a longterm lease with the buyer to lease back approximately 88 of the office space where our corporate headquarters is expected to remain 

during the third quarter of 2011 we incurred approximately 15 million of restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of our white marsh maryland office with our columbia maryland and washington dc offices during the fourth quarter of 2012 we incurred approximately 80000 of restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of our san francisco california office with our loopnet office in san francisco california 

as in the past we expect to continue to identify new facilities and consolidate existing facilities to better accommodate the changing demands of our business and employees as a result we may incur additional lease restructuring charges for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements 

subscriptionbased services 

our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and through our mobile application costargo and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment additionally we introduced costar property professional costar comps professional costar tenant and costargo in the uk in the fourth quarter of 2012 

our subscriptionbased services consist primarily of similar services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscriptionbased license agreements that renew automatically a majority of which have a term of one year upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased information services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 

we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2011  and 2012  our contract renewal rate for annual subscriptionbased services was approximately 93  and 94  respectively and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 7  and 6  respectively for the same time periods our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients further reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities “ars” whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2012  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of contractual cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period 

the only significant unobservable input in the discounted cash flow model is the discount rate the discount rate used represents our estimate of the yield expected by a market participant from the ars investments the weighted average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model based on the fair values of the ars was approximately 49  and 51  as of december 31 2011  and 2012  respectively selecting another discount rate within the range used in the discounted cash flow model would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the ars 

based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2012  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 19 million  the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2012  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

stockbased compensation 

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of our stock price for equity instruments that vest based on performance we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability as to whether or not the performance condition would be met if our initial estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions change the related stockbased compensation expense and timing of recognition may fluctuate from period to period based on those estimates if the performance conditions are not met no stockbased compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized stockbased compensation expense will be reversed 

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2012  however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate growth rate and future financial performance assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation that in 2013 the expenses for our international reporting unit will decrease upon the completion of our initiatives to upgrade the platform of services and expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment by the end of 2012 additionally our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation that revenues will increase as a result of further penetration of our international subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2012 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2012 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 

to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors then we perform the quantitative impairment test similar to the test performed on goodwill discussed above 

as of october 1 2012 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded the carrying value there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2012 that would indicate that the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share also referred to as nongaap eps ebitda is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs headquarters acquisition and transitionrelated costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs headquarters acquisition and transitionrelated costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 25 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information analytics and marketing services which has included acquisitions our net income has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs and restructuring costs adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition and integrationrelated costs headquarters acquisition and transitionrelated costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are purchase amortization and other related costs stockbased compensation acquisition and integrationrelated costs restructuring costs headquarters acquisition and transitionrelated costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda along with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income in 2010  and 2011  we assumed a 40 tax rate and in 2012  we assumed a 38 tax rate in order to approximate our longterm effective corporate tax rate 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

revenues  revenues increased  to 3499 million  in 2012  from 2517 million  in 2011  the increase  in revenues of approximately 982 million  is primarily attributable to additional revenue of approximately 600 million  from our april 2012 acquisition of loopnet as well as the further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates 

gross margin  gross margin increased  to 2351 million  in 2012  from 1636 million  in 2011  the gross margin percentage increased  to 672  in 2012  from 650  in 2011  the increase  in the gross margin amount and percentage was principally due to a 982 million   increase  in revenue partially offset by an increase  in cost of revenues cost of revenues increased  to 1149 million  in 2012  from 882 million  in 2011  the increase  in cost of revenues was principally due to the additional cost of revenues from our 2011 and 2012 acquisitions

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and debt from our term loan and revolving credit facility total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 1561 million  at december 31 2012  compared to 5488 million  at december 31 2011  the decrease  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2012  was primarily due to the net cash paid for our april 2012 acquisition of loopnet 

changes in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable various accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises purchases and sales of shortterm investments and similar events 

net cash provided by  operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 861 million  compared to 257 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  the 604 million   increase  in net cash provided by  operating activities is primarily due to an increase  of approximately 550 million  from net income plus noncash items primarily due to a change in deferred taxes associated with our april 2012 acquisition of loopnet as well as the amortization of certain intangible assets of loopnet additionally the increase  in net cash provided by  operating activities is also due to the approximately 54 million  net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements 

net cash used in  investing activities changed by approximately 6988 million  the 6404 million  cash used in  investing activities in 2012  was primarily due to 6409 million  of cash used for the acquisition of loopnet on april 30 2012 and purchases of property and equipment of approximately 148 million  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale and settlements of investments of approximately 154 million  proceeds from the sale and settlements of investments included approximately 42 million in proceeds for the sale of loopnets minority interest in xceligent additionally proceeds from the sale and settlements of investments included 42 million  in proceeds from the settlement of ars the 584 million  cash provided by  investing activities for the for the year ended december 31 2011  was primarily due to cash provided from the sale of our headquarters in washington dc of approximately 836 million  which occurred in february 2011 and did not recur in 2012 partially offset by 151 million  of cash used for the acquisition of virtual premise on october 25 2011 and purchases of property and equipment of approximately 150 million

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2012  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



1 longterm debt obligations include scheduled principal payments and exclude interest payments which are based on a variable rate of interest as defined in the credit agreement 

2 amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less or ii multiyear contracts that may be terminated by a third party or us amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of 28 million  due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including among others our operating results expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 

during 2012  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 148 million  we expect to make aggregate capital expenditures in 2013  of approximately 200 million to 250 million primarily related to the build out of leased office space 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

on october 25 2011 we acquired virtual premise a software as a service “saas” provider of real estate and lease management solutions located in atlanta georgia pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement we paid approximately 172 million in cash approximately 80 of which was paid on the closing date and the remaining 20 of which was held in escrow for approximately 270 days after the closing date the funds held in escrow were subject to the prior use of such funds to satisfy any postclosing net working capital adjustments or indemnification claims made prior to the date the funds were released the purchase price was reduced by approximately 200000 after taking into account postclosing purchase price adjustments and this amount was paid to us from the escrow fund on march 1 2012 the remaining escrowed funds were released to the former virtual premise stockholders on july 23 2012

we funded the cash portion of the consideration payable to loopnet stockholders in the merger through a combination of cash on hand including the net proceeds of approximately 2479 million from an equity offering we completed in june 2011 and 1750 million in proceeds from a term loan facility pursuant to the credit agreement dated february 16 2012 by and among costar as borrower costar realty as coborrower jp morgan bank as administrative agent and the other lenders thereto we made principal payments of approximately 44 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  maturities of our borrowings under the credit agreement for each of the next five years as of december 31 2012  are 175 million  241 million  328 million  612 million  and 350 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 to 2017 respectively

commencing with the fiscal year ending december 31 2012 the credit agreement requires us to make an annual prepayment of the term loan facility equal to a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement to reduce the principal amount outstanding under its term loan facility the repayment percentage is 50 when the total leverage ratio exceeds 300 to 100 25 when the total leverage ratio is greater than 250 to 100 but equal to or less than 300 to 100 and 0 when the total leverage ratio is equal to or less than 250 to 100 this repayment requirement is reduced by the amount of prior voluntary prepayments during the respective fiscal year subject to certain exceptions set forth in the credit agreement the excess cash flow payment if required is due within ten business days of the date on which the annual financial statements are delivered or required to be delivered to the lenders pursuant to the credit agreement for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012  we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment 

in connection with obtaining the term loan facility pursuant to the credit agreement we incurred approximately 115 million in debt issuance costs which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the credit agreement using the effective interest method the debt issuance costs are comprised of approximately 92 million in underwriting fees and approximately 23 million primarily related to legal fees associated with the debt issuance

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2012  we had 244 million  par value of longterm investments in student loan ars which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the shortterm in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future

included within our longterm investments are investments in mostly aaarated student loan ars these securities are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education as of december 31 2012  auctions for 244 million  of our investments in auction rate securities failed as a result we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par resulting in a loss based on an assessment of fair value of these investments in ars as of december 31 2012  we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 19 million  which was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments as a temporary impairment and recognize a greater unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss or as an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future see notes 4 and 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

we have approximately 8887 million  in intangible assets as of december 31 2012  as of december 31 2012  we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable however changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis

the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database approximately 1005 researchers and outside contractors our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 24 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of january 31 2012 our database of real estate information covered the us london england and other parts of the uk and parts of france and contained information about

costar research 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2011 our full time researchers and contractors drove millions of miles conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections and conducted millions of interviews of brokers owners and tenants 

research department as of january 31 2012 we had approximately 1005 commercial real estate research professionals and outside contractors performing research our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails internet updates and faxes each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of database information as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers 

  

  

  

costar has an extensive field research effort that includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional inventory photograph properties and verify existing information 

costar utilizes 144 hightech field research vehicles in 39 states and the uk of these vehicles 98 are customdesigned energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps some of our researchers also use customdesigned trucks with the same equipment as well as pneumatic masts that extend up to an elevation of twentyfive feet to allow for unobstructed building photographs from “birdseye” views each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for sale” or “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite in addition many of our field researchers are photographers who take photographs of commercial real estate properties to add to costar’s database of digital images 

data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third party data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information and analytic services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

competition 

the market for information and analytic services generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate industry the principal competitive factors for commercial real estate information and analytic services and providers are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the commercial real estate information and analytic services marketplace develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could easily enter the commercial real estate marketing arena while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

risks related to our pending acquisition of loopnet 

the failure to successfully integrate loopnet’s business and operations andor fully realize synergies from the merger in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results assuming completion of the merger with loopnet the success of that merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate loopnet’s business and operations and fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining our business and loopnet’s business however to realize these anticipated benefits and synergies our business and loopnet’s business must be successfully combined if we are not able to achieve these objectives following the merger the anticipated benefits and synergies of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

we and loopnet have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently the integration process could result in the loss of key employees loss of key clients increases in operating costs or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses any or all of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of the merger integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost savings from integrating our business and loopnet’s business while minimizing or eliminating any difficulties that may occur even if the integration of our two businesses is successful it may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost savings that we currently expect or these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our revenues expenses and operating results 

our business relationships including client relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger   parties with which we and loopnet do business may experience uncertainty associated with the transaction including with respect to current or future business relationships with us loopnet or the combined business of both companies our and loopnet’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as clients and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us loopnet or the combined business these disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of the combined business the adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by delays in the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 

 

the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed   the merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger those conditions include obtaining regulatory and antitrust approvals absence of orders prohibiting the completion of the merger or imposing a “substantial detriment” as defined in the merger agreement continued accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties to the merger agreement and the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements 

in addition both we and loopnet have rights to terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement 

the merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental and regulatory entities that may delay the date of completion of the merger or impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us   before the merger may be completed approvals must be obtained from governmental authorities both costar and loopnet filed notification and report forms with the department of justice and the ftc pursuant to the hsr act on may 31 2011 as a result the waiting period under the hsr act with respect to the proposed merger between us and loopnet was originally scheduled to expire on june 30 2011 as previously reported in a current report on form 8k on june 30 2011 costar and loopnet each received a request for additional information commonly referred to as a “second request” from the ftc in connection with its review of the merger the second request extended the waiting period imposed by the hsr act until 30 days after the parties have substantially complied with the second request unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the ftc at the ftc’s request costar and loopnet subsequently agreed to extend the waiting period imposed by the hsr act from 30 days to 60 days after the date of substantial compliance with the second request subject to further extension on 

  

  

  

  

november 4 2011 each of costar and loopnet certified as to its substantial compliance with the second request costar and loopnet subsequently voluntarily agreed to further extend the waiting period imposed by the hsr act on a 45day rolling basis to allow them to engage in discussions with the ftc to determine whether there is a possible basis for and to discuss the possible terms of a mutually acceptable consent order that would allow the merger to close if either costar and loopnet on the one hand or the ftc staff on the other hand believe that discussions towards a possible consent order are no longer moving forward productively either may trigger commencement of the 45day period in writing after the expiration of which the waiting period imposed by the hsr act will expire unless extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the ftc as of the date of filing of this annual report on form 10k the parties have not yet reached agreement on the terms of a consent order and there can be no assurance that such agreement will be reached in a timely manner or at all in the event the parties do not reach agreement on a consent decree andor a party triggers commencement of the 45day period the ftc may seek an injunction to block consummation of the merger 

in addition the ftc may include conditions on the completion of the merger or require divestitures or other changes relating to our operations or assets or loopnet’s such conditions divestitures or changes could have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the merger or reducing the anticipated benefits of the merger any of which might have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the merger we are not obligated to complete the merger if the regulatory approvals received in connection with the completion of the merger include any conditions or restrictions that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to impose a substantial detriment but we could choose to waive this condition 

we will incur significant transaction costs as a result of the merger   we expect to incur significant onetime transaction costs related to the merger these transaction costs include investment banking legal and accounting fees and expenses and filing fees printing expenses and other related charges we may also incur additional unanticipated transaction costs in connection with the merger a portion of the transaction costs related to the merger will be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed additional costs will be incurred in connection with integrating the two companies’ businesses such as it integration expenses costs in connection with the merger and integration may be higher than expected these costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation or prospects of the combined business 

failure to complete the merger in certain circumstances could require us to pay a termination fee or expenses   if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances we could be obligated to pay loopnet a 516 million termination fee payment of the termination fee could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

our indebtedness following the completion of the merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of costar and loopnet existing prior to the transaction this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our borrowing costs   on february 16 2012 we entered into a credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jp morgan bank as administrative agent the credit agreement provides for a 1750 million term loan facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years the obligation of the lenders to make the loans under the credit agreement is subject to the simultaneous closing of the merger with loopnet and the satisfaction of certain other conditions precedent we expect to use the proceeds of the term loan facility on the date on which such conditions are satisfied along with net proceeds from the equity offering in june 2011 to pay a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs related to the merger the proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used on the closing date to pay for transaction costs related to the merger and thereafter for working capital and other general corporate purposes of costar and its subsidiaries 

the credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries i to incur additional indebtedness ii to create incur assume or permit to exist any liens iii to enter into mergers consolidations or similar transactions iv to make investments and acquisitions v to make certain dispositions of assets vi to make dividends distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and vii to enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

 

  

  

 

the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be materially affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will satisfy any such requirements if we fail to comply with these covenants we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce its expenditures we may be unable to obtain such waivers amendments or alternative or additional financing at all or on favorable terms 

 

if an event of default occurs the lenders under the credit agreement are able to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and exercise remedies in respect of the collateral we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default 

we and loopnet may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger   uncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and loopnet employees may have an adverse effect on us and loopnet respectively and consequently the combined business this uncertainty may impair each company’s ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed or longer for the combined entity employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger as employees of each company may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business additionally loopnet’s officers and employees may own shares of loopnet’s common stock andor have stock option or restricted stock unit grants and if the merger is completed may therefore be entitled to the merger consideration the payment of which could provide sufficient financial incentive for certain officers and employees to no longer pursue employment with the combined business if our key employees or loopnet’s key employees depart we may have to incur significant costs in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees which could reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

an adverse judgment in a lawsuit challenging the merger may prevent the merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe    one of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no order injunction or decree or other legal restraint or prohibition that prevents the completion of the merger be in effect if any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting loopnet or costar from completing the merger on the agreedupon terms then such injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe 

risks related to our business 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  a reversal of recent improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information and analytic services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to more cancellations of our information and analytic services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

  

  

  

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information and analytic services our subscriptionbased information and analytic services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures the business failure of a current client or clients a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in this market may increase further as a result of current recessionary economic conditions as customer bases and customer spending have decreased and service providers are competing for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2012 we plan to continue to increase the depth of our coverage in the us uk and france and we may expand into additional geographies if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergy created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland grecam sas in france costar uk limited propex and property and portfolio research ltd in the uk the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergies acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations 

  

  

  

 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase see “ we and loopnet may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger” for a discussion of the impact the pending merger with loopnet may have on our ability to attract retain and motivate members of our sales force 

  

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees see “ we and loopnet may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger” for a discussion of the impact the pending merger with loopnet may have on our ability to attract retain and motivate members our management and operating personnel 

 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may continue to decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our historic revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a further weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

  

  

  

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited spn grecam sas propex and property and portfolio research ltd a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound or euro may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

  

us political credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact or impair the value of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments including us treasury securities and usbacked investments as well as our access to credit   our cash cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of common financial instruments including us treasury securities deterioration in the us credit and financial markets may result in losses or deterioration in the fair value of our cash cash equivalents or investments on august 5 2011 standard  poor’s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the united states of america from aaa to aa this downgrade and any future downgrades of the us credit rating could impact the stability of future us treasury auctions affect the trading market for us government securities result in increased interest rates and impair access to credit these factors could negatively impact the liquidity or valuation of our current portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments which may affect our ability to fund future obligations further these factors may result in an increase in interest rates and borrowing costs and make it more difficult to obtain credit on acceptable terms which may affect our ability to fund future obligations and increase the costs of obtaining financing for future obligations 

 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaarated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2011 we held 273 million par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2011 the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2011 we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 27 million the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2011 however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

 

  

  

 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information and analytic services to users 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected we cannot make assurances that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover any litigation claims 

an impairment in carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the existence of one or more of the following indicators could cause us to test for impairment prior to the annual assessment 

 

 

 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2011 we had 918 million of goodwill 675 million in our us segment and 243 million in our international segment we expect to record significant additional goodwill in connection with the loopnet merger if that transaction is consummated 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information and analytic services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information and analytic services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues and reducing our profitability 

  

  

  

our expansion into the commercial real estate analytics sector may not be successful or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the commercial real estate market research and forecasting arena imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general management resources during 2012 we expect to continue to expand our presence in the commercial real estate analytics sector if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur additional costs to expand our analytics services and we are not successful in marketing or selling these expanded services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

as a result of consolidation of facilities we may incur additional costs  we have taken and may continue to take actions that may increase our cost structure in the shortterm but are intended to reduce certain portions of our longterm cost structure such as consolidation of office space as a result of consolidation of office space we may reduce our longterm occupancy costs but incur restructuring charges if our longterm cost reduction efforts are ineffective or our estimates of cost savings are inaccurate our profitability could be negatively impacted expected savings from relocating facilities can be highly variable and uncertain further we may not be successful in achieving the operating efficiencies or operating cost reductions expected from these efforts in the amounts or at the times we anticipate 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information and analytic services and could reduce our profitability 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website the internet and our service providers problems with our website the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information and analytic services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information and analytic services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information and analytic services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information and analytic services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses our us researchers use integrated internal research processes to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

  

  

  

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information and analytic services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options 

our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate as a result of changes in general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plans data quality the development of our sales force managerial execution employee retention foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations inflation successful adoption of and training on our services litigation acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock

all forwardlooking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

costar group inc the “company” or “costar” is the number one provider of information and analytic services to the commercial real estate industry in the us and the uk based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available have the largest research department in the industry provide more information and analytic services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors we have created a standardized information and analytic platform where members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information tenant information information about properties for sale internet marketing services analytical capabilities information for clients websites information about industry professionals and their business relationships data integration and industry news we also provide market research and analysis for commercial real estate investors and lenders via our ppr service offerings portfolio and debt management and reporting capabilities through our resolve technology service offerings and real estate management solutions including lease administration and abstraction services through our virtual premise service offerings our service offerings span all commercial property types including office industrial retail land mixeduse hospitality and multifamily 

expansion and development 

we expect to develop and distribute new services expand existing services within our current platform including internationally and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization these initiatives are expected to include continued devleopment of costargo enhancements to our core information services including our suite of online services and development of new services for our brokerage clients most recently on august 15 2011 we launched costargo in the us costargo is an ipad application that integrates our comprehensive property tenant and comparable sales information in our suite of online products – costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional we supported the launch with an extensive marketing campaign during the third quarter of 2011 including a 34city national launch tour to drive early adoption of the service we incurred expenses of approximately 34 million during the third quarter of 2011 in connection with the launch of costargo we expect to continue to incur additional expenses associated with the marketing and sale of costargo 

we also intend to continue to expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london we intend to introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings in the upcoming future as part of our integration efforts in 2007 we introduced the “costar group” as the brand encompassing our international operations and in early 2010 we launched showcase our internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals high quality internet lead generation in the uk we expect to introduce costar property professional® costar comps professional® costar tenant® and costargo™ our ipad application in the uk in the upcoming future additionally we plan to upgrade back end research operations fulfillment and crm systems in the uk to support these new uk services in order to implement these services in the uk we have incurred and expect to incur increased development costs we believe that our continued investments in us products internationalization of our products and integration efforts have created a platform for longterm growth which we intend to continue to develop invest in and expand 

  

  

  

any future product development or expansion of services could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings throughout 2012 and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

our goal is to provide additional tools that make our research and analytics even more valuable to subscribers for example we are focusing on further integration and development of the services offered by the companies we have most recently acquired ppr resolve technology and virtual premise we have launched an initiative to develop a lease discounted cash flow “ldcf” forecasting and valuation solution that effectively integrates the combined capabilities of costar’s market and property information and ppr’s analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technology’s and virtual premise’s commercial real estate investment and management software expertise in order to implement this initiative we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs while our investments in ppr resolve technology and virtual premise have resulted and may continue to result in an increase in expenses our revenues have also increased as a result of these acquisitions and we have experienced increased crossselling opportunities among costar and the acquired companies 

  

on april 27 2011 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire loopnet pursuant to the merger agreement as a result of the merger a each outstanding share of loopnet common stock will be converted into a unit consisting of i 1650 in cash without interest and ii 003702 shares of costar common stock and b each outstanding share of loopnet series a convertible preferred stock unless previously converted into loopnet common stock will be converted into a unit consisting of i the product of 14880952 multiplied by the cash consideration and ii the product of 14880952 multiplied by the stock consideration representing a total equity value of approximately 8600 million and an enterprise value of 7620 million as of april 27 2011 the holders of loopnet’s series a convertible preferred stock delivered contingent conversion notices to loopnet pursuant to which such shares will be converted into loopnet common stock immediately prior to and contingent upon the completion of the merger the boards of directors of costar and loopnet have unanimously approved the transaction and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of loopnet’s common stock and series a preferred stock voting together as a single class on an asconverted basis have approved adoption of the merger agreement on july 11 2011 

we intend to fund the cash portion of the consideration payable to loopnet stockholders in the merger through a combination of cash on hand including the net proceeds of approximately 2479 million from an equity offering we completed in june 2011 and the proceeds of a 1750 million term loan facility available to us under a credit agreement dated february 16 2012 by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan bank as administrative agent the obligation of the lenders to make the loans under the credit agreement is subject to the simultaneous closing of the merger with loopnet and the satisfaction of certain other conditions precedent the proceeds of a 50 million revolving credit facility also available to us under the credit agreement may be used on the closing date of the loopnet merger to pay for transaction costs related to the merger and thereafter for working capital and other general corporate purposes in addition we received a commitment letter from jp morgan bank on april 27 2011 for a fully committed term loan of 4150 million and a 500 million revolving credit facility of which 375 million is committed this commitment letter remains outstanding and available subject to customary conditions to fund the loopnet acquisition and our ongoing working capital needs following the closing however we do not currently anticipate utilizing this commitment 

the loopnet transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act as previously disclosed in the proxy statementprospectus dated june 6 2011 both costar and loopnet filed notification and report forms with the department of justice and the ftc pursuant to the hsr act on may 31 2011 as a result the waiting period under the hsr act with respect to the proposed merger between costar and loopnet the “merger” was scheduled to expire on june 30 2011 as previously reported in a current report on form 8k on june 30 2011 costar and loopnet each received a request for additional information commonly referred to as a “second request” from the ftc with respect to the proposed merger at the ftc’s request costar and loopnet subsequently agreed to extend the waiting period imposed by the hsr act from 30 to 60 days after the date of substantial compliance with the second request unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the ftc on november 4 2011 each of the company and loopnet certified as to its substantial compliance with the second request as previously disclosed on january 3 2012 costar and loopnet voluntarily agreed to further extend the waiting period imposed by the hsr act on a 45day rolling 

  

  

  

  

basis to allow them to engage in discussions with the ftc to determine whether there is a possible basis for and to discuss the possible terms of a mutually acceptable consent order that would allow the merger to close on january 31 2012 costar and loopnet mutually agreed to extend the date after which either party may individually elect to terminate the merger agreement from january 31 2012 to april 30 2012 while there can be no assurance that agreement on the terms of a possible consent order can be reached in a timely manner or at all the company believes the discussions with the ftc staff are currently proceeding constructively and the company is hopeful that they will in the near term result in an agreement with the ftc staff on the terms of such a consent order subject to ftc approval 

in certain circumstances set forth in the loopnet merger agreement if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated loopnet may be obligated to pay us a termination fee of 258 million similarly in certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated we may be obligated to pay loopnet a termination fee of 516 million 

in light of our agreement to acquire loopnet we are currently evaluating how best to integrate the two businesses we expect that while we await final antitrust approval of the transaction we will continue to assess and finalize any plans for additional investments in our business for the foreseeable future at this time we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services within our current platform we expect to continue our efforts to integrate the combined capabilities of costar’s market and property information and ppr’s analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technology’s real estate investment software expertise we also plan to continue efforts to integrate virtual premise’s real estate management solutions with costar’s business 

while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings for 2012 and providing substantial cash flow for our business our proposed merger with loopnet and the subsequent integration of our two businesses could reduce our profitability cause us to generate losses and adversely affect our financial position further our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that will restrict our operations and use of our cash flow if the loopnet acquisition is completed 

market conditions 

there continue to be clear signs of improving conditions in the commercial real estate industry including strong leasing activity and positive net absorption of office space however the extent and duration of continued improvement of the economy and the commercial real estate industry is unknown continuing risks related to lower than expected job growth spiking energy costs and uncertainty over us and global economic issues may impede the ability and willingness of clients to purchase services from us or result in reductions of services purchased 

in some cases the business operations of some of our clients continue to be negatively affected by challenging economic conditions in the us and the world resulting at times in business consolidations and in some circumstances business failure if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates we compete against many other commercial real estate information and analytic service providers for business if customers choose to cancel our services for costcutting or other reasons our revenue could decline 

financial matters 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods currency exchange rate volatility may continue which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and periodtoperiod comparisons of our consolidated operations 

we currently issue stock options andor restricted stock to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations we plan to continue the use of stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 

  

  

  

property developments 

on february 5 2010 we took advantage of favorable market conditions and purchased an office building in downtown washington dc for 4125 million for use as our new headquarters and have since relocated to this location the “dc office building” the lease for our previous headquarters in bethesda md expired on october 15 2010 therefore we incurred overlapping occupancy costs through the end of the bethesda lease term as we transitioned to our new headquarters we were able to create value through our occupancy of the dc office building and on february 18 2011 sold the building for aggregate consideration of 1010 million 150 million of which was designated to fund additional buildout and planned improvements at the building approximately 125 million of the 150 million additional buildout is recorded as a leasehold improvement in property and equipment as part of the sale we entered into a longterm lease with the buyer to lease back approximately 88 of the office space where our corporate headquarters is expected to remain 

during the third quarter of 2011 we incurred approximately 15 million of restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of our white marsh maryland office with our columbia maryland and washington dc offices 

subscriptionbased services 

our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate approximately 94 of our total revenues costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment the majority of our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased information services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 our contract renewal rate for subscriptionbased services was approximately 93 and 90 respectively and therefore our cancellation rate was approximately 7 and 10 respectively for the same periods of time our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients further reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

  

  

  

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities “ars” whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2011 the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2011 we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 27 million the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2011 however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

fair value of deferred consideration 

we had no level 3 liabilities as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2010 we held level 3 liabilities for deferred consideration related to the october 19 2009 acquisition of resolve technology the deferred consideration totaled 32 million as of december 31 2010 and included i a potential deferred cash payment two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology’s revenue and ii other potential deferred cash payments for successful completion of operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through october 31 2013 which period may be extended by the parties to a date no later than december 31 2014 on june 24 2011 we made a payment to the seller of resolve technology of 500000 as a result of the successful completion of one of the operational milestones on september 8 2011 we entered into an agreement to settle all remaining potential deferred cash payments due under the original agreement under the terms of the agreement we made a payment of 16 million on september 14 2011 to settle the entire obligation we reversed the remaining 12 million originally recorded as deferred consideration by reducing general and administrative expense during the three months ended september 30 2011 

prior to the settlement on september 8 2011 we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our level 3 liabilities the significant assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included the discount rate estimates for future incremental revenue growth and probabilities for completion of operational and sales milestones 

stockbased compensation 

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of the company’s stock price 

  

  

  

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 however if significant changes in these assumptions occur they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

 

 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2011 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2011 that would indicate that the carrying value of either reporting unit may not be recoverable 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

  

  

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs restructuring costs headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs restructuring costs headquarters acquisition and transition related costs settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income loss in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 24 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information and analytic services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition costs and restructuring costs adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe the nongaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition costs headquarters acquisition and transition related costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

  

  

  

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are stockbased compensation acquisitionrelated costs restructuring costs headquarter acquisition and transition related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda along with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income we assume a 40 tax rate in order to approximate our longterm effective corporate tax rate 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment 

  

  

  

  

ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment us revenues increased to 2085 million from 1916 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively this increase in us revenue was primarily due to additional revenues as a result of our july 2009 acquisition of ppr focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment international revenues decreased approximately 300000 primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations offset by intersegment revenues of approximately 13 million attributable to services performed by property and portfolio research ltd for ppr ppr and property and portfolio research ltd were acquired in july 2009 intersegment revenues are eliminated from total revenues 

segment ebitda us ebitda decreased to 396 million from 477 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in us ebitda was due primarily to additional personnel cost of approximately 81 million increased legal settlement charges of approximately 800000 and a lease restructuring charge of approximately 13 million related to the consolidation of our three facilities located in boston massachusetts partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 22 million international ebitda increased to a loss of 32 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from a 12 million loss for the year ended december 31 2009 this increased loss was primarily due to approximately 20 million paid in connection with the settlement of our litigation with nokia uk limited international ebitda includes a corporate allocation of approximately 400000 and 500000 for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the corporate allocation represents costs incurred for us employees involved in international management and expansion activities

recent acquisitions 

virtual premise  on october 25 2011 we acquired virtual premise a saas provider of real estate information management solutions pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement we paid approximately 172 million in cash approximately 80 of which was paid on the closing date to the virtual premise stockholders and the remaining 20 of which will be held in escrow until paid 270 days after the closing date subject to use of such funds to satisfy any postclosing net working capital adjustments or indemnification claims made prior to such date the purchase price was later reduced by approximately 200000 after taking into account postclosing purchase price adjustments and this amount is expected to be paid to us from the escrow fund 

accounting treatment  we have applied the acquisition method to account for the virtual premise transaction which requires that among other things assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date the purchase price was allocated to tradenames customer base database technology goodwill and various other asset and liability accounts the acquired customer base for the acquisitions which consists of one distinct intangible asset and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over ten years the identified intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives goodwill for these acquisitions is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of virtual premise have been consolidated with those of the company since the date of the acquisition and are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements accordingly pro forma financial information has not been presented for the acquisition the purchase accounting is preliminary and is subject to change 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 5488 million at december 31 2011 compared to 2101 million at december 31 2010 the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to 2479 million in net proceeds from our equity offering in june 2011 of 4312500 shares of common stock for 6000 per share in addition in february 2011 we sold the 169429 squarefoot office building located at 1331 l street nw in downtown washington dc for 1010 million in cash 150 million of which was designated to fund additional buildout and planned improvements at the building 

changes in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable various accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises purchases and sales of shortterm investments and similar events 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 257 million compared to 393 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 136 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease of approximately 213 million from net income plus noncash items partially offset by a 77 million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements the 213 million decrease from net income plus noncash items was primarily related to a decrease in changes in deferred income taxes net of approximately 188 million the change in deferred income taxes net of 188 million is primarily comprised of approximately 135 million related to the tax treatment of the deferred gain on the sale of the building and approximately 54 million related to the tax 

  

  

  

  

treatment of acquisition related costs associated with the pending loopnet acquisition the 77 million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in changes in income tax receivable of approximately 90 million partially offset by a decrease in changes in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately 27 million the increase in changes in income tax receivable of approximately 90 million was due to the 2011 collection of approximately 41 million of the 49 million income tax receivable recorded in 2010 as the tax legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of 2010 allowed us to deduct 100 of qualifying assets purchased after september 8 2010 the decrease in changes in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately 27 million was primarily due to the 21 million payment made for the deferred consideration for the year ended december 31 2011 as a result of the settlement of the deferred consideration related to the company’s october 19 2009 acquisition of resolve technology see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the deferred consideration settlement 

net cash provided by investing activities was 584 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 405 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this 989 million increased change in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the sale of our new headquarters in downtown washington dc in february 2011 as well as the february 2010 purchase of that building partially offset by the acquisition of virtual premise 

net cash provided by financing activities was 2548 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 20 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this 2528 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the equity offering of 4312500 shares of common stock for 6000 per share completed in june 2011 net proceeds from the equity offering were approximately 2479 million after deducting approximately 104 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately 500000 

 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

concurrent with the sale of the 169429 squarefoot office building located at 1331 l street nw in downtown washington dc we entered into a lease with gll lstreet 1331 llc “gll” to lease back 149514 square feet of the office space located in the building for use as our corporate headquarters the lease will expire may 31 2025 subject to two 5year renewal options the initial base rent is 3850 per square foot of occupied space escalating 25 per year commencing june 1 2011 minimum lease payments will be approximately 60 million 61 million 63 million 64 million and 66 million for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 respectively and a total of 626 million from 2017 to the end of the lease term 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our operating results expansion efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 

during 2011 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 150 million we expect to make capital expenditures in 2012 of approximately 150 million to 200 million 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

  

  

  

on october 25 2011 we acquired virtual premise a saas provider of real estate information management solutions located in atlanta georgia pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement we paid approximately 172 million in cash approximately 80 of which was paid on the closing date and the remaining 20 of which will be held in escrow until paid 270 days after the closing date subject to use of such funds to satisfy any postclosing net working capital adjustments or indemnification claims made prior to such date the purchase price was later reduced by approximately 200000 after taking into account postclosing purchase price adjustments and this amount is expected to be paid from the escrow fund to the company

on april 27 2011 we received a commitment letter from jp morgan bank for a fully committed term loan of 4150 million and a 500 million revolving credit facility of which 375 million are committed which will be available subject to customary conditions to fund the loopnet acquisition and the ongoing working capital needs of costar and its subsidiaries following the transaction in june 2011 we completed an equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately 2479 million we intend to use these proceeds to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of loopnet on february 16 2012 we entered into a credit agreement by and among costar as borrower costar realty information inc as coborrower the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan bank as administrative agent the credit agreement provides for a 1750 million term loan facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility each with a term of five years the obligation of the lenders to make the loans under the credit agreement is subject to the simultaneous closing of the merger with loopnet and the satisfaction of certain other conditions precedent we expect to use the proceeds of the term loan facility on the date on which such conditions are satisfied along with net proceeds from the equity offering in june 2011 to pay a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs related to the merger the proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used on the closing date to pay for transaction costs related to the merger and thereafter for working capital and other general corporate purposes of costar and its subsidiaries the original commitment letter from jp morgan bank received on april 27 2011 remains outstanding and available subject to customary conditions to fund the loopnet acquisition and the ongoing working capital needs of costar and its subsidiaries following the loopnet transaction until the earlier of funding of the term loan facility into escrow pursuant to the credit agreement if applicable and the business day after the beginning of the marketing period under the merger agreement however we do not currently anticipate utilizing that original commitment 

in connection with obtaining the facility pursuant to the credit agreement we expect to incur approximately 106 million in debt issuance costs which will be capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the term of the credit agreement using the effective interest method the debt issuance costs will be comprised of approximately 91 million in underwriting fees and approximately 15 million primarily related to legal fees associated with the debt issuance we have incurred approximately 900000 in debt issuance costs as of december 31 2011and have paid approximately 300000 

the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including antitrust clearance we have expensed approximately 142 million in acquisitionrelated costs in general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2011 as a result of the pending loopnet acquisition of which we have paid approximately 134 million and expect to pay the remaining balance in 2012 we expect to incur approximately 10 million to 30 million in additional acquisitionrelated costs the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of loopnet’s common stock and series a convertible preferred stock voting together as a single class on an asconverted basis approved the adoption of the merger agreement on july 11 2011 the transaction is not subject to a financing condition in certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated loopnet may be obligated to pay us a termination fee of 258 million similarly in certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated we may be obligated to pay loopnet a termination fee of 516 million we are not in a position yet to estimate the financial impact the proposed merger will have on our operations 

  

  

  

we engaged jp morgan securities llc “jp morgan” to act as our financial advisor in connection with the acquisition we are obligated to pay 40 million to jp morgan if the acquisition closes completion of the merger remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act and other customary closing conditions as of december 31 2011 the parties have not yet reached agreement with the ftc on the terms of a consent order with the ftc and there can be no assurance that such agreement will be reached in a timely manner or at all 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2011 we had 273 million par value of longterm investments in student loan ars which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the shortterm in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

  

  

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining our extensive database approximately 957 researchers and outside contractors our experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 23 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of january 31 2011 our database of real estate information covered the us london england and other parts of the uk and parts of france and contained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

costar research 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2010 our full time researchers and contractors drove millions of miles conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections and conducted millions of interviews of brokers owners and tenants 

research department as of january 31 2011 we had approximately 957 commercial real estate research professionals and outside contractors performing research our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails internet updates and faxes each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of database information as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers 

costar has an extensive field research effort that includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional inventory photograph properties and verify existing information 

costar utilizes 144 hightech field research vehicles in 41 states and the uk of these vehicles 98 are customdesigned energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps some of our researchers also use customdesigned trucks with the same equipment as well as pneumatic masts that extend up to an elevation of twentyfive feet to allow for unobstructed building photographs from “birdseye” views each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for sale” or “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite in addition many of our field researchers are photographers who take photographs of commercial real estate properties to add to costar’s database of digital images 

data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third party data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information marketing and analytic services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include 

 

 

 

 

finally one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day

as the commercial real estate information marketing and analytic services marketplace develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify a company like bloomberg lp has the resources and has previously announced an intention to move into the commercial real estate information business further a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could easily enter the commercial real estate marketing arena while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors current or future competitors could materially harm our business

risk factors 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  a reversal of recent improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity and absorption rates or a renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information marketing and analytic services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to more cancellations of our information marketing and analytic services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant 

  

  

  

  

increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information marketing and analytic services our subscriptionbased information marketing and analytic services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures if clients decide to cancel services or not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates we may incur costs in the preliminary stages of an acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergy created through combinations managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland grecam sas in france costar uk limited propex and property and portfolio research ltd in the uk the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition including expected synergy acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected  in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in this market may increase further as a result of current recessionary economic conditions as customer bases and customer spending have decreased and service providers are competing for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

  

  

  

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may continue to decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our historic revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a further weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited spn grecam sas propex and property and portfolio research ltd a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound or euro may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaa rated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2010 we held 322 million par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

 

  

  

 

our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value accordingly the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2010 the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2010 we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 30 million the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2010 however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2011 we plan to continue to increase the depth of our coverage in the us uk and france and we may expand into additional geographies if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information marketing and analytic services to users 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected we cannot make assurances that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover any litigation claims 

an impairment in carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting 

  

  

  

  

units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the existence of one or more of the following indicators could cause us to test for impairment prior to the annual assessment 

 

 

 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2010 we had 796 million of goodwill 553 million in our us segment and 243 million in our international segment 

our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate as a result of changes in general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plans data quality the development of our sales force managerial execution employee retention foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations inflation successful adoption of and training on our services litigation acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information marketing and analytic services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information marketing and analytic services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues and reducing our profitability 

our expansion into the commercial real estate analytics sector may not be successful or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the commercial real estate market research and forecasting arena imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general management resources during 2011 we expect to continue to expand our presence in the commercial real estate analytics sector if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be 

  

  

  

  

adversely affected in addition if we incur additional costs to expand our analytics services and we are not successful in marketing or selling these expanded services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

as a result of consolidation of facilities we may incur additional costs we have taken and may continue to take actions that may increase our cost structure in the shortterm but are intended to reduce certain portions of our longterm cost structure such as consolidation of office space as a result of consolidation of office space we may reduce our longterm occupancy costs but incur restructuring charges if our longterm cost reduction efforts are ineffective or our estimates of cost savings are inaccurate our profitability could be negatively impacted expected savings from relocating facilities can be highly variable and uncertain for instance we may not meet the requirements necessary to receive the full property tax abatement provided by the district of columbia as incentive for us to relocate our headquarters to downtown washington dc and may incur greater property taxes than anticipated in connection with the move to our new headquarters further we may not be successful in achieving the operating efficiencies or operating cost reductions expected from these efforts in the amounts or at the times we anticipate 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information marketing and analytic services and could reduce our profitability 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website the internet and our service providers problems with our website the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information marketing and analytic services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information marketing and analytic services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses our us researchers use integrated internal research processes to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

  

  

  

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information marketing and analytic services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees

we have consistently worked to expand our service offerings both in terms of geographical coverage and the scope of services offered in order to position the company for future revenue growth in 2004 we began our expansion into 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the us and began expanding the geographical coverage of many of our existing us and uk markets we completed our expansion into the 21 new markets in the first quarter of 2006 in early 2005 in conjunction with the acquisition of national research bureau we launched a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information the retail component of our flagship product costar property professional was unveiled in may 2006 at the international council of shopping centers’ convention in las vegas 

during the second half of 2006 in order to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings we began actively researching commercial properties in 81 new core based statistical areas “cbsas” in the us we increased our us field research fleet by adding 89 vehicles and we hired researchers to staff these vehicles we released our costar property professional service in the 81 new cbsas across the us in the fourth quarter of 2007 throughout our recent expansion efforts we have remained focused on ensuring that costar continues to provide the quality of information our customers expect as such in 2010 we expanded our research operations and we plan to continue to grow our research operations slightly in 2011 in order to continue to meet customer expectations 

during the second half of 2009 as a part of our strategy to provide subscribers with tools for conducting primary research and analysis on commercial real estate we expanded subscribers’ capabilities to use costar’s database of researchverified commercial property information to conduct indepth analysis and generate reports on trends in sales and leasing activity online further in july 2009 we acquired ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary providers of real estate investment analysis and market forecasting services 

in connection with our acquisitions of propex grecam and ppr’s wholly owned subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 

we intend to eventually introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings in 2007 we introduced the “costar group” as the brand encompassing our international operations and in early 2010 we launched showcase our internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals the opportunity to make their listings accessible to all visitors to our public websites in the uk we believe that our recent us and international expansion and integration efforts have created a platform for longterm growth which we intend to continue to develop invest in and expand 

we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services expand existing services within our current platform and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization for instance in july 2009 we expanded subscribers’ analytic capabilities to use our online database to conduct indepth analysis and generate reports on sales and leasing activity through our acquisition of ppr and in october 2009 we acquired resolve technology which enabled us to provide our customers with additional tools for analyzing commercial real estate markets any future expansion including expansion through acquisitions and expansion internationally could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings throughout 2011 and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

our goal is to provide additional tools that make our research and analytics even more valuable to subscribers for example we are currently focusing on integration and further development of the ppr and resolve technology service offerings we have launched an initiative to develop a discounted cash flow dcf forecasting and valuation solution that effectively integrates the combined capabilities of costar’s market and property information and ppr’s analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technology’s real estate investment software expertise in order to implement this initiative we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs including costs of hiring additional personnel while our investments in ppr and resolve technology have resulted and may continue to result in an increase in expenses our revenues have also increased as a result of these acquisitions and we have experienced increased crossselling opportunities among costar and the acquired companies 

  

  

  

  

in some cases the business operations of some of our clients continue to be negatively affected by challenging economic conditions in the us and the world resulting at times in business consolidations and in some circumstances business failure if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay continue at the current rate or increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates additionally current economic conditions may cause customers to reduce expenses and customers may be forced to purchase fewer services from us or cancel all services we compete against many other commercial real estate information marketing and analytic service providers for business if customers choose to cancel our services for costcutting or other reasons our revenue could decline 

there are clear signs of improving conditions in the commercial real estate industry including heightened leasing activity and positive net absorption of office space resulting from modest officerelated job growth and recent business expansions in the us the extent and duration of continued improvement of the economy and the commercial real estate industry is unknown as is the extent and duration of any benefits resulting from any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy because of these uncertainties and any resulting impact on our business we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or earnings based on current economic conditions we believe that the company is positioned to generate continued sustained earnings from current operations in 2011 and for the foreseeable future 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods currency exchange rate volatility may continue which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and periodtoperiod comparisons of our consolidated operations 

we currently issue stock options andor restricted stock to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations we plan to continue the use of stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 

we recently decided to take advantage of favorable market conditions to lower our longterm occupancy costs as a tenant as part of our overall strategy to consolidate our london office locations and reduce occupancy costs we relocated our london offices and in july 2010 entered into a settlement pursuant to which we terminated our lease for our former london offices in addition in september 2010 we consolidated our three facilities located in the boston massachusetts area including the facilities used by costar ppr and resolve technology into one facility we recorded a lease restructuring charge of approximately 13 million in general and administrative expense in the third quarter of 2010 as a result of the boston office consolidation in december 2010 we consolidated our new york and iselin new jersey offices into one facility the consolidation of these facilities did not result in a lease restructuring charge 

on february 5 2010 we took advantage of favorable market conditions and purchased an office building in downtown washington dc for 4125 million for use as our new headquarters and have since relocated to this location the lease for our previous headquarters in bethesda md expired on october 15 2010 therefore we incurred overlapping occupancy costs through the end of the bethesda lease term as we transitioned to our new headquarters we were able to create value through our occupancy of the building in washington dc and on february 18 2011 sold the building for aggregate consideration of 1010 million 150 million of which is being held in escrow to fund additional buildout and planned improvements at the building as part of the sale we entered into a longterm lease with the buyer to lease back approximately 88 of the office space where our corporate headquarters will remain we expect that the leaseback arrangement will result in additional expense of approximately 45 million to 50 million in 2011 

  

  

  

 

our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate more than 94 of our total revenues costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment the majority of our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased information services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 and 2009 our contract renewal rate for subscriptionbased services was approximately 90 and 85 respectively and therefore our cancellation rate was approximately 10 and 15 respectively for the same periods of time our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results as a result management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of shortterm and longterm performance our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may decline if negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations among our clients further reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different acceptable assumptions would yield different results changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

fair value of auction rate securities 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants there is a threetier fair value hierarchy which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions our level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities “ars” whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education 

our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value accordingly the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2010 the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2010 we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 30 million the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions andor their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

  

  

  

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december 31 2010 however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 

fair value of deferred consideration 

our level 3 liabilities consist of a 32 million liability as of december 31 2010 for deferred consideration related to the october 19 2009 acquisition of resolve technology the deferred consideration is for i a potential deferred cash payment two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology’s revenue and ii other potential deferred cash payments for successful completion of operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through october 31 2013 which period may be extended by the parties to a date no later than december 31 2014 

we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our level 3 liabilities as of december 31 2010 the significant assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate estimates for future incremental revenue growth and probabilities for completion of operational and sales milestones 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the deferred consideration we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the deferred consideration as of december 31 2010 however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant we may be required to recognize additional liabilities related to this deferred consideration 

stockbased compensation 

we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fairvalue based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires us to estimate the dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected life of the stock option these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and postemployment termination behavior expected future employee option exercise patterns and the historical volatility of the company’s stock price 

we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stockbased compensation expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 however if changes in these assumptions occur and should those changes be significant they could have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model as of october 1 2010 the date of our most recent impairment analysis the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october 1 2010 that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stockbased compensation expense acquisition related costs restructuring costs headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stockbased compensation expense acquisition related costs restructuring costs headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs we may disclose adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 

 

  

  

 

we view ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income loss in calculating ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share 

ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap measures when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 23 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information marketing and analytic services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition costs and restructuring costs ebitda adjusted ebitda nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization acquisition costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business we believe the disclosure of these nongaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe these nongaap measures are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and other items such as interest income taxes stockbased compensation expenses acquisition costs headquarters acquisition and transition related costs restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda nongaap net income or nongaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share are stockbased compensation acquisition related costs restructuring costs headquarter acquisition and transition related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda along with the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate nongaap net income we assume a 40 tax rate in order to approximate our longterm effective corporate tax rate 

nongaap net income per diluted share is a nongaap financial measure that represents nongaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2010 and year ended december 31 2009 

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment us revenues increased to 2085 million from 1916 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively this increase in us revenue was primarily due to additional revenues as a result of our july 2009 acquisition of ppr focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment international revenues decreased approximately 300000 primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations offset by intersegment revenues of approximately 13 million attributable to services performed by property and portfolio research ltd for ppr ppr and property and portfolio research ltd were acquired in july 2009 intersegment revenues are eliminated from total revenues

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2009 and year ended december 31 2008 

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides operating segment revenue and ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment us revenues increased to 1916 million from 1901 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively this increase in us revenue is due to additional revenues of approximately 85 million included as a result of our july 2009 acquisition of ppr partially offset by a decrease of approximately 70 million in us revenues due to decreased sales resulting from a difficult commercial real estate and economic environment focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment international revenues decreased approximately 43 million primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations partially offset by intersegment revenues of approximately 900000 attributable to services performed by property and portfolio research ltd for ppr intersegment revenues are eliminated from total revenues 

segment ebitda us ebitda decreased to 477 million from 588 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in us ebitda was due primarily to additional costs incurred by ppr which we acquired in july of 2009 and increased legal fees international ebitda decreased to a loss of 12 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from a 22 million loss for the year ended december 31 2008 this decreased loss is primarily due to a lower corporate allocation in 2009 as compared to 2008 international ebitda includes a corporate allocation of approximately 500000 and 11 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the corporate allocation represents costs incurred for us employees involved in international management and expansion activities

recent acquisitions 

ppr  on july 17 2009 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd providers of real estate analysis market forecasts and credit risk analytics to the commercial real estate industry we acquired ppr from dmg information inc “dmgi” in exchange for 572999 shares of costar common stock which had an aggregate value of approximately 209 million as of the closing date on july 17 2009 we issued 433667 shares of our common stock to dmgi and we issued the remaining 139332 shares to dmgi on september 28 2009 after taking into account postclosing purchase price adjustments 

resolve technology  on october 19 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of resolve technology a delaware corporation for approximately 45 million consisting of approximately 34 million in cash and 25886 shares of costar common stock which had an aggregate value of approximately 11 million as of the closing date the shares are subject to a threeyear lockup pursuant to which onethird were released in october 2010 the purchase price is subject to certain postclosing adjustments additionally the seller may be entitled to receive i a potential deferred cash payment due approximately two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology’s revenue as of september 2011 over its revenue as of september 2009 and ii other potential deferred cash payments for successful completion of operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through no later than october 31 2013 which period may be extended by the parties to a date no later than december 31 2014 

accounting treatment  these acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business combinations for each of the ppr and resolve technology acquisitions the purchase price was allocated to various working capital accounts developed technology customer base trademarks noncompetition agreements and goodwill the acquired customer base for the acquisitions which consists of one distinct intangible asset for each acquisition and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over ten years the identified intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives goodwill for these acquisitions is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of ppr and resolve technology have been consolidated with those of the company since the respective dates of the acquisitions and are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements accordingly pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of the acquisitions 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 2101 million at december 31 2010 compared to 2260 million at december 31 2009 the decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to the purchase of a 169429 squarefoot office building located at 1331 l street nw in downtown washington dc for a purchase price of 4125 million in cash and approximately 17 million in acquisition costs as well as other purchases of property and equipment of approximately 144 million partially offset by net cash flows from operating and financing activities of 413 million 

  

  

  

changes in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable accounts payable various accrued expenses and deferred revenues as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises purchases and sales of shortterm investments and similar events 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 393 million compared to 385 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 800000 increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a 44 million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements partially offset by a decrease of approximately 36 million from net income plus noncash items the 44 million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in changes in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately 52 million and approximately 30 million in increased change in deferred revenue primarily associated with cash received for annual billings the increase in the change in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately 52 million includes increased changes in accruals of deferred rent of approximately 26 million 800000 accrued in june 2010 in anticipation of the settlement of a litigation matter 900000 remaining in the lease restructuring charge associated with our boston lease consolidation in september 2010 and increased accruals associated with the operations of our recent acquisitions and new headquarters these increases in changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by a decrease in the changes in income tax receivable of approximately 49 million as the tax legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of 2010 allowed us to deduct 100 of qualifying assets purchased after september 8 2010 resulting in an income tax receivable recorded for the year ended december 31 2010 

net cash used in investing activities was 405 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 45 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this 450 million increased change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the february 2010 purchase of our new headquarters in downtown washington dc as well as capital improvements for our facilities in 2010 partially offset by the 32 million in net cash payments for acquisitions 

net cash provided by financing activities was relatively consistent at 20 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

 

 

in 2010 we purchased our new headquarters in downtown washington dc and made capital expenditures of approximately 144 million we expect to make total capital expenditures in 2011 of approximately 70 million to 100 million 

on february 2 2011 1331 l street holdings llc “holdings” our wholly owned subsidiary and gll lstreet 1331 llc “gll” an affiliate of munichbased gll real estate partners gmbh entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which i holdings agreed to sell to gll its interest in the 169429 squarefoot office building located at 1331 l street nw in downtown washington dc and ii costar realty information inc “costar realty” our wholly owned subsidiary agreed to enter into a lease expiring may 31 2025 with two 5year renewal options with gll to lease back 149514 square feet of the office space located in this building which we will continue to use as our corporate headquarters the closing of the sale took place on february 18 2011 the aggregate consideration paid by gll to holdings pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement was 1010 million in cash 150 million of which is being held in escrow to fund additional buildout and planned improvements at the building 

 

  

  

 

the lease is effective as of june 1 2010 and will expire may 31 2025 the initial base rent is 3850 per square foot of occupied space escalating 25 per year commencing june 1 2011 our obligation to pay rent increases proportionately over the course of the first year of the lease as certain scheduled completion dates for our build out on a floorbyfloor basis are reached our occupied space under the lease will consist of the entire rented premises as of june 1 2011 from and after which we will owe rent on the entire leased premises annual lease payments for 2011 will be approximately 50 million this obligation is not included in the above december 31 2010 contractual obligation table 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our operating results expansion efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions in the third quarter of 2009 we issued 572999 shares of common stock to dmgi inc for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary in october 2009 we acquired resolve technology for approximately 34 million 29 million was paid upon acquisition and 450000 was deferred until february 2010 in cash and 25886 shares of costar common stock which had an aggregate value of approximately 11 million as of the closing date the shares are subject to a threeyear lockup pursuant to which onethird were released in october 2010 additionally the seller may be entitled to receive i a potential deferred cash payment due approximately two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology’s revenue as of september 2011 over its revenue as of september 2009 and ii other potential deferred cash payments for successful completion of additional operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through october 31 2013 which period may be extended by the parties to a date no later than december 31 2014 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2010 we had 322 million par value of longterm investments in student loan ars which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the short term in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 

on december 8 2009 a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the southern district of california alleging violations of the fair labor standards act and california state wageandhour laws and is seeking unspecified damages under those laws the complaint also seeks to declare a class of all similarly situated employees to pursue similar claims in may 2010 the parties reached a preliminary agreement to settle this lawsuit and in june 2010 we accrued approximately 800000 in anticipation of making a settlement payment that will formally resolve this litigation we anticipate the payment will be due during the second quarter of 2011

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information and analysis members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively market research including historical and forecast conditions and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

 

  

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities experienced analysts easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining its extensive database over 975 researchers and outside contractors experienced team of analysts and economists technological expertise and broad customer base we believe that we have created such a platform 

the us and global economies have changed adversely over the past year or more and the commercial real estate industry has been negatively impacted the commercial real estate market has seen a reduction in property sales and leasing activity lower absorption rates climbing vacancy rates and decreases in rental rates and sales prices the full extent of the impact of our current financial crisis is not yet clear as our customers continue to look for ways to reduce spending we may continue to see reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services however we believe that even in a weakened economy there is a continuing need for accurate standardized commercial real estate information marketing and analytic services we believe that access to continuously researched and verified commercial real estate information becomes even more valuable in a down market as industry players assess where market conditions are heading how their businesses should adapt determine what properties are worth and try to market their properties among other things moreover outsourcing the laborintensive task of conducting basic real estate research may result in cost savings for our clients 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 22 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of january 29 2010 our database of real estate information covered the us as well as london england and other parts of the uk and parts of france and contained

data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third party data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information marketing and analytic services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

  

management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

competition

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the commercial real estate information marketing and analytic services marketplace develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical analytic or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify for example the national association of realtors and bloomberg lp have moved into the commercial real estate information business and intend to compete with us in the commercial real estate information space similarly a company like google which has a farreaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities could easily enter the commercial real estate marketing arena something google has already done with residential real estate while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors competition could materially harm our business

a continuing decline or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  a continuing decline in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates or a sustained downturn in the commercial real estate market’s for sale activity may continue to hamper our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers either of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information marketing and analytic services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to more cancellations of our information marketing and analytic services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability 

 

 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability further continuing bank failures and freezing of the credit markets generally other adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a further dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of the negative economic conditions that have persisted for more than a year we have seen increased customer cancellations reductions of services and failures to timely pay amounts due to us if we continue to experience greater cancellations and more reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information marketing and analytic services our subscriptionbased information marketing and analytic services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures if clients decide to cancel services or not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate and revenues may decline 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected  in order to support revenues and future revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may continue to decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic 

  

  

expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected in 2009 we were unable to sustain our historic revenue growth rates and in fact our annual revenues declined in 2009 compared to 2008 we may not be able to return to our historic revenue growth rates and our revenues may continue to decline our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a further weakening of the us or global economy competition or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in this market may increase further as a result of current recessionary economic conditions as customer bases and customer spending decrease and service providers are competing for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could distract management’s attention away from operating our business could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected we cannot make assurances that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover any litigation claims 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited spn grecam sas propex and property and portfolio research ltd a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound or euro may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information marketing and analytic services to users 

  

  

an impairment in carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board “fasb” authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the existence of one or more of the following indicators could cause us to test for impairment prior to the annual assessment 

 

 

 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2009 we had 803 million of goodwill 552 million in our us segment and 251 million in our international segment 

our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate as a result of changes in general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plans data quality the development of our sales force managerial execution employee retention foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations inflation successful adoption of and training on our services litigation acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaa rated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2009 we held 328 million par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

 

 

our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value accordingly the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2009 the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2009 we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 30 million the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

our expansion into the commercial real estate analytics sector may not be successful or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the commercial real estate market research and forecasting arena imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general management resources during 2010 we expect to continue to expand our presence in the commercial real estate analytics sector if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur additional costs to expand our analytics services and we are not successful in marketing or selling these expanded services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information marketing and analytic services and could reduce our profitability 

  

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2010 we plan to continue to increase the depth of our coverage in the us and uk if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information marketing and analytic services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information marketing and analytic services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues and reducing our profitability 

our continuing expansion into the retail real estate sector may not be completed successfully or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the retail real estate sector imposed and continues to impose additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during the next year we expect to continue to expand the number of retail properties contained within our database if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively if this expansion effort takes longer than planned or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand our retail sector services and we are not successful in marketing and selling these expanded services or customers fail to accept these new services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website the internet and our service providers problems with our website the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information marketing and analytic services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information marketing and analytic services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties or analysis is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses our us researchers use integrated internal research processes to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

 

 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including managing the integration of personnel and products including those of ppr and resolve technology managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland grecam sas in france costar uk limited propex and property and portfolio research ltd in the uk the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets obtaining credit in the current economic environment may be difficult and cost prohibitive we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations 

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information marketing and analytic services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information marketing and analytic services lower revenues and increased costs 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in 2006 we adopted authoritative guidance for stock compensation which required us to expense the value of granted stock options 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees

during the second half of 2009 as a part of our strategy to provide subscribers with tools for conducting primary research and analysis on commercial real estate we expanded subscribers’ capabilities to use costar’s database of researchverified commercial property information to conduct indepth analysis and generate reports on trends in sales and leasing activity online further in july 2009 we acquired ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary providers of real estate investment analysis and market forecasting services 

in connection with our acquisitions of propex grecam and ppr’s wholly owned subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 

we intend to eventually introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings in 2007 we introduced the “costar group” as the brand encompassing our international operations we believe that our recent us and international expansion and integration efforts have created a platform for longterm growth 

we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services expand existing services within our current platform consider strategic acquisitions and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization for instance in may 2008 we released costar showcase ®  an internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals the opportunity to make their listings accessible to all visitors to our public website wwwcostarcom more recently in july 2009 we expanded subscribers’ analytic capabilities to use our online database to conduct indepth analysis and generate reports on sales and leasing activity through our acquisition of ppr and in october 2009 we acquired resolve technology which enabled us to provide our customers with additional tools for analyzing commercial real estate markets any future expansion could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings throughout 2010 and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

  

current general economic conditions in the us and the world are negatively affecting business operations for our clients and are resulting in more business consolidations and in certain circumstances failures as a result of these economic conditions we continue to see customer cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay amounts due to us although at a slower pace than in previous quarters if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay continue at the current rate or increase and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates additionally 

  

  

current economic conditions may cause customers to reduce expenses and customers may be forced to purchase fewer services from us or cancel all services we compete against many other commercial real estate information marketing and analytic service providers for business if customers choose to cancel our services for costcutting or other reasons our revenue could decline the extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the economy is unknown the extent and duration of any benefits resulting from any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy are currently unknown and there can be no assurance that those initiatives will be successful in the future because of these uncertainties we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or earnings however we continue to believe that the company is positioned to generate continued sustained earnings in 2010 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods currency volatility may continue which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

we currently issue stock options andor restricted stock to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations we plan to continue the use of stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 

  

our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate more than 95 of our total revenues costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment the majority of our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased information services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 and 2008 our contract renewal rate was approximately 85 and 89 respectively as discussed above our trailing twelvemonth contract renewal rate may continue to decline if continuing negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures andor consolidations further reductions in customer spending or decreases in the customer base 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

 

 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model a 50 decrease in the fair value of our international reporting unit as of december 31 2009 would have no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statements of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases currently the nongaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda which is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 

 

 

we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss in calculating ebitda we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of this nongaap financial measure as a result of these exclusions ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 

  

ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 22 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information marketing and analytic services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and nonoperating items such as interest and income taxes provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2009 and year ended december 31 2008 

we manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides segment revenue and ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

segment ebitda us ebitda decreased to 477 million from 588 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in us ebitda was due primarily to additional costs incurred by ppr which we acquired in july of 2009 and increased legal fees international ebitda decreased to a loss of 12 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from a 22 million loss for the year ended december 31 2008 this decreased loss is primarily due to a lower corporate allocation in 2009 as compared to 2008 international ebitda includes a corporate allocation of approximately 500000 and 11 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the corporate allocation represents costs incurred for us employees involved in international management and expansion activities 

comparison of year ended december 31 2008 and year ended december 31 2007 

revenues  revenues grew to 2124 million in 2008 from 1928 million in 2007 this increase in revenue was due to further penetration of our subscriptionbased information and marketing services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional focus services and propex services as of december 31 2008 our subscriptionbased information and marketing services represented more than 90 of our total revenues

income tax expense net income tax expense net increased to 201 million in 2008 from 99 million in 2007 this increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes for 2008 due to our growth and profitability in addition to a higher effective tax rate in 2008 the effective tax rate was lower in 2007 due to the gain on lease settlement in the uk that was completed in december 2007 the lease settlement resulted in income in the uk which reduced the overall effective tax rate 

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2008 and year ended december 31 2007 

due to the increased size complexity and funding requirements associated with our international expansion in 2007 we began to manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides segment revenue and ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 2260 million at december 31 2009 compared to 1953 million at december 31 2008 the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2009 was primarily due to net cash from operating activities of approximately 396 million net cash provided from financing activities of approximately 22 million partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets of approximately 105 million and net cash paid for acquisitions of approximately 32 million 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 396 million compared to 409 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 13 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease of approximately 55 million from net income plus noncash items a decrease of approximately 47 million due to changes in prepaid expenses and deposits and decreased cash receipts for deferred revenue of 11 million partially offset by decreased payments for accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately 57 million and 43 million in increased cash receipts on receivables 

net cash provided by investing activities was 34 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 524 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this 490 million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the decision in 2008 to invest in money market funds and us treasuries instead of shortterm investment instruments which resulted in a net sale of investments of approximately 591 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to sales of investments of approximately 172 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

net cash provided by financing activities was 22 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 115   million for the year ended december 31 2008 the change is due to decreased proceeds from exercise of stock options 

  

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in february 2010 we purchased a 169429 squarefoot leed gold certified office building located at 1331 l street nw in downtown washington dc for a purchase price of 4125 million in cash 

during 2009 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 105 million we expect to make capital expenditures in 2010 of approximately 200 million to 250 million 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we may use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions we paid 30 million in initial cash consideration in april 2008 and 17 million in deferred consideration in august 2009 for the online commercial real estate information assets of first cls inc an atlantabased provider of local commercial real estate information in the third quarter of 2009 we issued 572999 shares of common stock to dmgi inc for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary in october 2009 we acquired resolve technology for approximately 34 million 29 million was paid upon acquisition and 450000 was deferred until february 2010 in cash and 25886 shares of costar common stock additionally the seller may be entitled to receive i a potential deferred cash payout two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology’s revenue and ii other potential deferred cash payouts for successful completion of additional operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through june 30 2013 which period may be subject to extension to a date no later than december 31 2014 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2009 we had 328 million par value of longterm investments in student loan auction rate securities “ars” which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the short term in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 

on december 23 2008 the company initiated a financial industry regulatory authority “finra” arbitration against credit suisse first boston “csfb” related to csfb’s purchase of ars for the company’s account our complaint asserts breach of contract fraud breach of fiduciary duty and other causes of action an arbitration hearing was originally scheduled to begin during the week beginning december 7 2009 but was rescheduled at the request of csfb and is now set to begin on march 8 2010 we expect to receive a ruling on its claim during the second quarter of 2010 since the outcome of this legal proceeding is uncertain at this time we cannot estimate the amount of gain or loss if any that could result from the resolution of this matter 

recent accounting pronouncements

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability properties for sale rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

 

 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining its extensive database approximately 900 researchers and outside contractors technological expertise and broad customer base costar believes that it has created such a platform 

the us and global economies have changed adversely over the past year or more and the commercial real estate industry has been negatively impacted the commercial real estate market has seen a reduction in property sales and leasing activity lower absorption rates climbing vacancy rates and decreases in rental rates and sales prices the full extent of the impact of our current financial crisis is not yet clear as our customers continue to look for ways to reduce spending we may continue to see reduced demand for our informationmarketing services however we believe that even in a weakened economy there is a continuing need for accurate standardized commercial real estate informationmarketing services we believe that access to continuously researched verified commercial real estate information becomes even more valuable in a down market as industry players assess where market conditions are heading how their businesses should adapt determine what properties are worth and try to market their properties among other things moreover outsourcing the laborintensive task of conducting basic real estate research may result in cost savings for our clients 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 21 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of january 30 2009 our database of real estate information covered the us as well as london england and other parts of the uk and parts of france and contained

data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third party data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information demographic information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our informationmarketing services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from one to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include

risk factors 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the continuing decline in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates and the ongoing downturn in the commercial real estate market’s for sale activity may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers both of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our informationmarketing services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation or other costcutting measures by our customers may lead to more cancellations of our informationmarketing services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth to decline and reduce our profitability 

negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions recessions inflation deflation exchange rates interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability further continuing bank failures and freezing of the credit markets generally other adverse national and global economic events as well as any significant terrorist attack are likely to have a further dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons 

 

 

unrelated to our operating performance in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue conversely deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of current economic conditions we have recently seen an increase in customer cancellations reductions of services and failures to timely pay amounts due us if we experience greater cancellations and more reductions of services and failures to timely pay and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our informationmarketing services our subscriptionbased informationmarketing services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation economic pressures a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or competitive pressures if clients decide to cancel services or not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate revenues and our revenue growth rate may decline 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected  in order to support revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited spn grecam sas and propex a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position recently foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated greatly and may continue to fluctuate significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue which in turn affects our consolidated revenue currencies may be affected by internal factors general economic conditions and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound or euro may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

 

if we are unable to sustain our revenue growth or our operating costs are higher than expected our profitability may be reduced and our operating results may fluctuate significantly  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue growth rate many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected additionally we may not be able to sustain our historic revenue growth rates and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline our revenue and operating profit growth depend on continued increased demand for our services our sales are affected by among other things general economic and commercial real estate conditions reduced demand whether due to changes in customer preference a further weakening of the us or global economies or other reasons may result in decreased revenue and growth adversely affecting our operating results 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing competition in this market may increase further as a result of current recessionary economic conditions as customer bases and customer spending decrease and service providers are competing for fewer customer resources our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers our revenues and revenue growth could decline increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected we cannot make assurances that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover any litigation claims 

 

we may be subject to legal liability for collecting displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation negligence unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our informationmarketing services to users 

an impairment in carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the existence of one or more of the following indicators could cause us to test for impairment prior to the annual assessment 

 

 

 

 

these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which would reduce our profitability impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges which may reduce our profitability as of december 31 2008 we had 543 million of goodwill 315 million in our us segment and 228 million in our international segment 

 

our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate as a result of changes in general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plans data quality the development of our sales force managerial execution employee retention foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations inflation successful adoption of and training on our services litigation acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including economic factors quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings and regulatory developments in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

international operations expose us to additional business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our longterm investments currently our longterm investments include mostly aaa rated auction rate securities “ars” which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of december 31 2008 we held 331 million par value of ars all of which failed to settle at auctions when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

 

our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value accordingly the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december 31 2008 the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates credit spreads timing and amount of cash flows liquidity risk premiums expected holding periods and default risk of the ars based on this assessment of fair value as of december 31 2008 we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 37 million the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or informationmarketing services and could reduce our profitability 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2009 we plan to continue to increase the depth of our coverage in the us and uk if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

our continuing expansion into the retail real estate sector may not be completed successfully or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the retail real estate sector imposed and continues to impose additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during the next year we expect to continue to expand the number of retail properties contained within our database if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively if this expansion effort takes longer than planned or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand our retail sector services and we are not successful in marketing and selling these expanded services or customers fail to accept these new services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded informationmarketing services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our informationmarketing services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues or our revenue growth rate and reducing our profitability 

 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our informationmarketing services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website the internet and our service providers problems with our website the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our informationmarketing services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our informationmarketing services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our informationmarketing services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our informationmarketing services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses our us researchers use integrated internal research processes to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

if we are not able to successfully identify finance andor integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland grecam sas in france costar uk limited and propex in the uk the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets obtaining credit in the current economic environment may be difficult and cost prohibitive we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all if necessary to finance future acquisitions making it impossible or more costly to acquire complementary businesses if we are able to obtain financing the terms may be onerous and more restrictive than we are willing to accept 

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our informationmarketing services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our informationmarketing services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our informationmarketing services lower revenues and increased costs 

 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in the first quarter of 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas 123r which required us to expense the value of granted stock options we recorded 29 million in compensation charges for stock options in 2006 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees

tableend 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains “forwardlooking statements” including statements about our beliefs and expectations there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those stated above in item 1a under the headings “risk factors ¾ cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” and “ ¾ risk factors” as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 

all forwardlooking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

costar group inc “costar” is the number one provider of informationmarketing services to the commercial real estate industry in the us and the uk based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available have the largest research department in the industry provide more informationmarketing services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors we have created a standardized informationmarketing platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information tenant information information about properties for sale internet marketing services information for clients websites information about industry professionals and their business relationships analytic information data integration and industry news our service offerings span all commercial property types – office industrial retail land mixeduse hospitality and multifamily 

since 1994 we have expanded the geographical coverage of our existing informationmarketing services and developed new informationmarketing services in addition to internal growth this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource inc in chicago in 1996 and new market systems inc in san francisco in 1997 in august 1998 we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houstonbased real estate information provider c data services inc in january 1999 we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend inc and into atlanta and dallasfort worth by acquiring jamison research inc in february 2000 we acquired compscom inc a san diegobased provider of commercial real estate information in november 2000 we acquired first image technologies inc a californiabased provider of commercial real estate software in september 2002 we expanded further into portland oregon through the acquisition of certain assets of napier realty advisors doing business as realnet in january 2003 we established a base in the uk with our acquisition of londonbased focus information limited in may 2004 we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research inc and in september 2004 we extended our coverage of the uk through the acquisition of scottish property network “spn” in september 2004 we strengthened our position in denver colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp inc a local comparable sales information provider 

in january 2005 we acquired national research bureau a connecticutbased leading provider of us shopping center information in december 2006 our uk subsidiary costar limited acquired grecam sas “grecam” a provider of commercial property information and marketlevel surveys studies and consulting services located in paris france in february 2007 costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited “propex” a provider of commercial property information and operator of an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of investment property located in london england in april 2008 we acquired the assets of first cls inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro an atlantabased provider of local commercial real estate information the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section under the heading “recent acquisitions” 

 

 

in 2004 we began our expansion into 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the us as well as expanding the geographical coverage of many of our existing us and uk markets we completed our expansion into the 21 new markets in the first quarter of 2006 in early 2005 in conjunction with the acquisition of national research bureau we launched a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information the new retail component of our flagship product costar property professional was unveiled in may 2006 at the international council of shopping centers’ convention in las vegas 

during the second half of 2006 to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings we began actively researching commercial properties in 81 new core based statistical areas “cbsas” in the us increased our us field research fleet by adding 89 vehicles and hired researchers to staff these vehicles in march 2007 we signed a longterm lease for a new research facility in white marsh maryland in support of our expanded research efforts and hired and trained additional researchers and other personnel we released our costar property professional service in the 81 new cbsas across the us in the fourth quarter of 2007 

in connection with our acquisitions of propex and grecam we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and integrate our international operations more fully with those of the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 

we intend to eventually introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings in 2007 we introduced the “costar group” as the brand encompassing our international operations we believe that our recent us and international expansion and integration efforts have created a platform for earnings in fact our results for 2008 reflect growth in earnings as a result of these investments in our business 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services expand existing services within our current platform consider strategic acquisitions and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization for instance in may 2008 we released costar showcase ®  an internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals the opportunity to make their listings accessible to all visitors to our public website wwwcostarcom in addition in april 2008 as described above we acquired the online commercial real estate information assets of first cls inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro any future expansion could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable driving overall earnings throughout 2009 and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

 

current general economic conditions in the us and the world are negatively affecting business operations for our clients and are resulting in more business consolidations and in certain circumstances failures as a result of the economic conditions we have recently seen an uptick in customer cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay amounts due us if cancellations reductions of services and failures to pay continue to rise and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers our revenues will be adversely affected and our revenue may decline additionally current conditions may cause customers to reduce expenses when reducing expenses customers may be forced to purchase fewer services or cancel all services we compete against many other commercial real estate informationmarketing service providers for business if customers choose to cancel our services for costcutting or other reasons our revenue could decline the extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the economy is unknown and there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy will be successful because of the current uncertainties in the economic environment we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue however we continue to believe that the company is positioned to generate continued sustained earnings through the end of 2009 

 

we currently issue restricted stock and stock options to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations we plan to continue the use of alternative stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income we incurred approximately 49 million in total equity compensation expense in 2008 

 

our subscriptionbased informationmarketing services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate more than 90 of our total revenues costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment our contracts for our subscriptionbased informationmarketing services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are generally based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the year ended december 31 2007 our contract renewal rate was over 90 for the year ended december 31 2008 our contract renewal rate was approximately 89 as discussed above our contract renewal rate may continue to decline if continuing negative economic conditions lead to business failures andor consolidations and further reductions in customer spending and decreases in the customer base 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors including the factors listed below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we test for impairment 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we consider our operating segments us and international as our reporting units under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statements of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases currently the nongaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda which is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 

we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss in calculating ebitda we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 

 

ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 21 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our informationmarketing services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and nonoperating items such as interest and income taxes provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

comparison of year ended december 31 2008 and year ended december 31 2007 

revenues  revenues grew to 2124 million in 2008 from 1928 million in 2007 this increase in revenue was due to further penetration of our subscriptionbased informationmarketing services and successful crossselling of our services to our customers in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional focus services and propex services as of december 31 2008 our subscriptionbased informationmarketing services represented more than 90 of our total revenues 

 

 

gross margin  gross margin increased to 1390 million in 2008 from 1161 million in 2007 the gross margin percentage increased to 654 in 2008 from 602 in 2007 the increase in the gross margin resulted principally from revenue growth from our subscriptionbased informationmarketing services and a decrease in cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased to 734 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 767 million for the year ended december 31 2007 principally due to expansion costs that were incurred in 2007 that were not incurred in 2008 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses decreased to 417 million in 2008 from 518 million in 2007 and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 196 in 2008 from 269 in 2007 the decrease was principally due to a reduction in personnel costs of approximately 54 million primarily due to the fact that the sales force sold services with a smaller average price point in 2008 which resulted in lower average contract values compared to 2007 additionally there was a decrease in marketing initiatives of approximately 23 million in 2008 

software development expenses  software development expenses slightly increased to 128 million in 2008 from 125 million in 2007 and slightly decreased as a percentage of revenues to 60 in 2008 from 65 in 2007 the decrease in the percentage was primarily due to increased revenues in 2008 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased to 399 million in 2008 from 366 million in 2007 and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues to 188 in 2008 from 190 in 2007 the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was principally a result of an increase of approximately 25 million in legal fees and an increase of 16 million in bad debt expense 

gain on lease settlement net on september 14 2007 costar uk limited a wholly owned uk subsidiary of costar entered into an agreement with trafigura limited to assign to trafigura our leasehold interest in our office space located in london the lease assignment was effective on december 19 2007 as a result costar uk limited was paid 76 million net of expenses for the assignment of the lease there were no gains on lease settlements in 2008

interest and other income net interest and other income net decreased to 49 million in 2008 from 80   million in 2007 although cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments were higher in 2008 than in 2007 our interest and other income decreased due to lower average interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007 

income tax expense net income tax expense net increased to 201 million in 2008 from 99 million in 2007 this increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes for 2008 due to our growth and profitability in addition to a higher effective tax rate in 2008 the effective tax rate was lower in 2007 due to the gain on lease settlement in the uk that was completed in december 2007 the lease settlement resulted in income in the uk which reduced the overall effective tax rate 

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2008 and year ended december 31 2007 

due to the increased size complexity and funding requirements associated with our international expansion in 2007 we began to manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides segment revenue and ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

 

 

segment revenues  costar property professional costar tenant and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment us revenues increased to 1901 million from 1703 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this increase in us revenue is due to further penetration of our us subscriptionbased informationmarketing services and the successful crossselling of our service to our customers combined with a continued high renewal rate focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment international revenues slightly decreased to 224 million from 225 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this decrease is due to foreign currency fluctuations in their functional currency international revenues increased 72 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 

segment ebitda us ebitda increased to 588 million from 329 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in us ebitda was due to increased revenues and lower sales and marketing personnel costs partially offset by an increase in legal fees and bad debt expense international ebitda decreased to a loss of 22 million from 11 million earnings for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this decrease is primarily due to gain on lease settlement of 76 million in 2007 that did not occur in 2008 international ebitda also includes a corporate allocation of approximately 11 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the corporate allocation represents costs incurred for us employees involved in international management and expansion activities

due to the increased size complexity and funding requirements associated with our international expansion in 2007 we began to manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and segment ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  us revenues increased to 1703 million from 1461 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in us revenue is due to further penetration of our us subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling into our customer base across our service platform in existing markets combined with a continued high renewal rate international revenues increased to 225 million from 128 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in international revenue is principally a result of a combination of further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services in the uk and the acquisitions of grecam and propex 

segment ebitda us ebitda increased to 329 million from 262 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in us ebitda was due to increased revenues partially offset by increased research costs and growth in our sales force as a result of our expansion international ebitda increased to 11 million from a loss of 315000 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase is primarily due to the assignment of our lease to trafigura offset by our increased investment in international expansion international ebitda also includes a corporate allocation of approximately 26 million and 10 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the corporate allocation represents costs incurred for us employees involved in international management and expansion activities

recent acquisitions 

propex on february 16 2007 costar limited acquired property investment exchange limited “propex” a provider of webbased commercial property information and operator of an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of investment property in the uk propex’s suite of electronic platforms and listing websites give users access to the uk commercial property investment and leasing markets costar limited acquired all outstanding capital stock of propex for approximately 220 million consisting of cash deferred consideration and 21526 shares of costar common stock 

first cls inc on april 1 2008 we acquired certain assets of first cls inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro an atlantabased provider of local commercial real estate information for 30 million in initial cash consideration and deferred consideration payable within approximately six months of the oneyear anniversary of closing 

accounting treatment  these acquisitions were accounted for using purchase accounting the purchase price for the propex acquisition was primarily allocated to acquired customer base trade names and goodwill the purchase price for the first cls inc acquisition was primarily allocated to acquired customer base the acquired customer base for the acquisitions which consists of one distinct intangible asset for each acquisition and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over ten years the propex acquired trade name is being amortized on a straightline basis over 

 

 

three years we recorded goodwill of approximately 150 million for the propex acquisition and 11 million for the first cls inc acquisition goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of propex and first cls inc have been consolidated with those of the company since the respective dates of the acquisitions and are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements accordingly pro forma financial information has not been presented for either acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 1953 million at december 31 2008 compared to 1874 million at december 31 2007 the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2008 was primarily due to net cash from operating activities of approximately 409 million partially offset by the reclassification of approximately 331 million par value auction rate securities “ars” from shortterm investments to longterm investments in the first quarter of 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 409 million compared to 517 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 108 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to approximately 33 million decreased cash receipts on accounts receivable due to increased balances and declining economic conditions and increased payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately 98 million which included the 29 million payment of deferred consideration for the propex acquisition approximately 400000 in payments for a propex data agreement and payment of approximately 14 million in value added taxes related to the lease settlement 

net cash provided by investing activities was 524 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 403 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this 927 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the decision to invest in money market funds and us treasuries instead of shortterm investment instruments which resulted in a net sale of investments of approximately 591 million in the year ended december 31 2008 compared to a net purchase of investments of approximately 93 million in the year ended december 31 2007 in addition we used 30 million in cash as initial consideration for the purchase of first cls inc in the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 167 million in cash consideration used for the acquisition of propex in the year ended december 31 2007 we also purchased approximately 106 million less in property equipment and other assets during the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 

net cash provided by financing activities was 115 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 82   million for the year ended december 31 2007 the higher net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is due to an increase in excess tax benefits from stock options partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

 

 

during 2008 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 37 million we expect to make capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately 40 million to 70 million 

 

 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we expect to use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions in april 2008 we paid 30 million in initial cash consideration and made a commitment for deferred consideration payable within approximately six months of the oneyear anniversary of closing for the online commercial real estate information assets of first cls inc an atlantabased provider of local commercial real estate information 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2008 we had 331 million of longterm investments in student loan ars which failed to settle at auctions the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program “ffelp” of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the short term in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 

as of december 31 2008 we had utilized all of our us net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be approximately 200 million to 230 million in 2009 

inflation may affect the way we operate in the us and abroad in general we believe that over time we are able to increase the prices of our services to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations and we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on our operations in 2009 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” “fin 48” which became effective for our company as of january 1 2007 fin 48 addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under fin 48 we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin 48 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the adoption of sfas 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “ the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” “sfas 162” which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements sfas 162 is effective as of november 17 2008 the adoption of sfas 162 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december 31 2008 as of december 31 2008 we had 1953 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not believe that increases or decreases in interest rates will impact our ability to operate our business in the foreseeable future 

included within our longterm investments are investments in mostly aaa rated student loan ars these securities are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education as of december 31 2008 auctions for 331 million of our investments in auction rate securities failed as a result we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par resulting in a loss based on an assessment of fair value of these investments in ars as of december 31 2008 we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 37 million which was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments as a temporary impairment and recognize a greater unrealized loss in other comprehensive income or as an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

we have approximately 707 million in intangible assets as of december 31 2008 as of december 31 2008 we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable however changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

since our founding in 1987 costar’s strategy has been to provide commercial real estate professionals with critical knowledge to explore and complete transactions by offering the most comprehensive timely and standardized information on us commercial real estate as a result of our january 2003 acquisition of focus information limited june 2004 acquisition of scottish property network december 2006 acquisition of grecam sas and february 2007 acquisition of property investment exchange limited we have extended our offering of comprehensive commercial real estate information to include london and other parts of the uk and parts of france information about costar’s revenues from and longlived assets located in foreign countries is included in notes 2 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements costar’s revenues net income assets and liabilities broken out by segment are set forth in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements information about risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

we deliver our content to our us customers via an integrated suite of online service offerings that includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information tenant information information about properties for sale property information for clients’ websites information about industry professionals and their business relationships analytic information data integration property marketing and industry news we have created and are continually improving a standardized information platform where the commercial real estate industry and related businesses can continuously interact and easily facilitate transactions due to the efficient exchange of accurate information supplied by costar 

we have a number of assets that provide a unique foundation for our standardized platform including the most comprehensive proprietary database in the industry the largest research department in the industry proprietary data collection information management and quality control systems a large inhouse product development team a broad suite of webbased information services and a large base of clients our database has been developed and enhanced for more than 20 years by a research department that makes thousands of daily database updates in addition to our internal efforts to grow the database we have obtained and assimilated over 51 proprietary databases 

costar intends to continue to grow its standardized platform of commercial real estate information in 2004 costar began research for a 21market us expansion effort in the first quarter of 2006 costar had successfully launched service in each of those 21 markets in addition following our acquisition of national research bureau in january 2005 we launched various research initiatives as part of our expansion into real estate information for retail properties in july 2006 we announced our intention to commence actively researching commercial properties in approximately 81 new core based statistical areas “cbsas” across the us in an effort to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings including our new retail service in the fourth quarter of 2007 we released our costar property professional service in the 81 new cbsas across the us 

 

costar also intends to continue to grow and expand the coverage of its service offerings within the uk in december 2006 costar’s uk subsidiary costar limited acquired grecam sas a provider of commercial property information and marketlevel surveys studies and consulting services located in paris france in february 2007 costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited a provider of commercial property information and operator of an online investment property exchange located in london england costar intends to integrate its uk and french operations more fully with its us operations and eventually to introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings

industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining its extensive database 1041 researchers and outside contractors technological expertise and broad customer base costar believes that it has created such a platform 

 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 20 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of february 28 2008 our database of real estate information covered the us as well as london england and other parts of the uk and parts of france and contained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costar research 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2007 our full time researchers and contractors drove millions of miles conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections and conducted millions interviews of brokers owners and tenants 

research department as of january 31 2008 we employed 869 commercial real estate research professionals and 172 individuals acting as outside contractors performing research our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails internet updates and faxes each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of database information as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers in 2007 we continued outsourcing a limited number of research related projects to outside firms to supplement the work of our research employees 

 

costar has an extensive field research effort that includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional inventory photograph properties and verify existing information costar’s research efforts have traditionally focused on office and industrial properties following our acquisition of national research bureau in january 2005 we launched a major expansion effort into real estate information for retail properties in july 2006 we announced our intention to commence actively researching commercial properties in approximately 81 new cbsas across the us in an effort to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings including our new retail service in the fourth quarter of 2007 we released the costar property professional service in the 81 new cbsas across the us 

 

as part of costar’s research efforts costar utilizes 152 hightech field research vehicles in 43 states and the uk of these vehicles 101 are customdesigned energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps some of our researchers also use customdesigned trucks with the same equipment as well as pneumatic masts that extend up to an elevation of twentyfive feet to allow for unobstructed building photographs from “birdseye” views each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for sale” or “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite in addition many of our field researchers are photographers who take photographs of commercial real estate properties to add to costar’s database of digital images

risk factors 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the continuing decline in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates and the recent downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers both of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our information services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability 

our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information services our subscriptionbased information services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients in expansion markets and our existing clients may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors including without limitation a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or economic or competitive pressures if clients decide to cancel services or not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients then our renewal rate revenues and our revenue growth rate may decline 

general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including perceived and actual economic conditions inflation interest rates taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability further any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue if clients choose to cancel our information services as a result of economic conditions and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected 

 

 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected  in order to support revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected we cannot assure you that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover any litigation claims 

if our operating costs are higher than we expect our profitability may be reduced  many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses additionally we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information services and could reduce our profitability 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2007 we expanded geographic coverage in us and uk and increased the depth of our coverage during 2008 we plan to increase the depth of our coverage in the us and uk with our current resources if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

our continuing expansion into the retail real estate sector may not be completed successfully or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  expanding into the retail real estate sector imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during the next year we expect to continue to expand the number of 

 

 

retail properties contained within our database if we are unable to manage this expansion effectively if this expansion effort takes longer than planned or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial position could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand our retail sector services and we are not successful in marketing and selling these expanded services or customers fail to accept these new services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

international expansion may result in new business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international operations and expansion could subject us to new business risks including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the us currency exchange rate fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our growth successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 

competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues or our revenue growth rate and reducing our profitability 

if we are not able to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland grecam sas in france and property investment exchange limited in the uk the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets 

 

 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website the internet and our service providers problems with our website the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree despite careful development and testing we cannot be certain that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses in november 2006 we integrated internal research processes that our us researchers use to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plans data quality the development of our sales force managerial execution employee retention foreign currency fluctuations inflation successful adoption of and training on our services litigation acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings regulatory developments and economic or other factors in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internet related and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock 

 

 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial position  due to our acquisitions of costar uk limited formerly focus information limited spn grecam sas and propex a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial position currencies may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound or euro may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our shortterm investments currently our shortterm investments include aaa rated auction rate securities which are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities as of february 22 2008 291 million of the 331 million of our shortterm investments in auction rate securities have failed to settle at auctions if the credit market does not improve auctions for the remaining 40 million of our invested amounts may fail when an auction fails for securities in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities immediately in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in the first quarter of 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas 123r which required us to expense the value of granted stock options we recorded 29 million in compensation charges for stock options in 2006 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management web development marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is distributed to others we may be subject to claims for defamation negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information services to users

legal proceedings

on may 8 2007 we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of maryland against centers  malls llc and two individuals costars complaint alleged that these defendants unlawfully obtained part of costars proprietary and copyrighted database and subsequently sold this stolen data for profit costars complaint sought equitable and monetary relief including but not limited to a permanent injunction barring defendants from unlawful use of costar products and disgorgement to costar of illgotten gains shortly after filing suit costar obtained a temporary restraining order barring centers  malls llc from selling utilizing or distributing its products that were pirated from costars database on january 8 2008 the parties entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release pursuant to which centers  malls agreed among other things to permanently shut down its business operations and pay costar monetary damages in full release of all claims against centers  malls and its employees in february 2008 a stipulation for entry of judgment and permanent injunction was filed with the court and the complaint was dismissed 

 

on november 15 2007 loopnet inc “loopnet” filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles against costar and certain unnamed john does for breach of contract unfair competition and violation of california computer crime statute the complaint alleges that costar unlawfully copied and used loopnets data and seeks injunctive relief compensatory damages restitution and other costs including attorneys’ fees to be proven at trial loopnet does not contend that anyone at costar has logged into loopnet’s website and copied listings nor does costar believe that to be the case instead the central contention of loopnet’s lawsuit appears to be that it is unlawful for costar to use information provided to costar by commercial real estate brokers and property owners that 1 type in their own listings and upload their own photos into either loopnet’s listing service or loopnets software and web site hosting solution looplink and 2 use either the “email to a friend” function available within loopnet’s service to send their listings for marketing on costar or direct costar personnel to market the listings that appear on the brokers or owners websites   this contention is presumably based on the assumption that loopnet controls the listings created by commercial real estate brokers and owners that use loopnet and that loopnet can prevent brokers and owners from marketing their own listings if the listings also appear on loopnets listing service or a website hosted by looplink costar believes that loopnet’s claims are unfounded 

 

costar filed its answer and several claims against loopnet in this proceeding including breach of contract unfair competition and other claims we are seeking injunctive relief restitution prejudgment interest costs and disbursements attorneys’ fees and direct consequential compensatory and punitive damages loopnet has filed a motion to strike costar’s claims against loopnet in this action 

 

 

were loopnet to prevail in this lawsuit we could be required to make payments andor comply with injunctive relief including potentially removal of certain listings which could negatively impact our business and operating results although no assurance can be given as to the outcome of this lawsuit costar believes loopnets allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself 

 

on february 5 2008 we filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against loopnet for false advertising under section 43a of the lanham act costar alleges that loopnet has engaged in false advertising by making misleading statements to the marketplace about the number of people that use its website specifically costar believes based on current statements made by loopnet that the 25 million registered users that loopnet reports is not the number of current users but rather the total cumulative number of user ids created over the last decade or so and therefore includes user ids that have not been used in years and in some cases multiple user ids for the same person our lawsuit alleges that loopnet’s use of this 25 million figure to competitively market how many users it currently has is false and misleading 

 

costars complaint seeks injunctive relief and the maximum dollar amount permitted under the lanham act as well as attorneys’ fees and costs loopnet has not yet answered costar’s complaint 

 

currently and from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business we are not a party to any lawsuits or proceedings that in the opinion of our management based on consultations with legal counsel are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

all forwardlooking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

costar is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and the united kingdom based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available have the largest research department in the industry provide more information services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors we have created a standardized information platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information tenant information information about properties for sale information for clients websites information about industry professionals and their business relationships analytic information data integration property marketing and industry news our service offerings span all commercial property types  office industrial retail land mixeduse hospitality and multifamily 

since 1994 we have expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information services in addition to internal growth this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource inc in chicago in 1996 and new market systems inc in san francisco in 1997 in august 1998 we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houstonbased real estate information provider c data services inc in january 1999 we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend inc and into atlanta and dallasfort worth by acquiring jamison research inc in february 2000 we acquired compscom inc a san diegobased provider of commercial real estate information in november 2000 we acquired first image technologies inc in september 2002 we expanded further into portland oregon through the acquisition of certain assets of napier realty advisors dba realnet in january 2003 we established a base in the uk with our acquisition of londonbased focus information limited in may 2004 we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research inc and in september 2004 we extended our coverage of the uk through the acquisition of scottish property network in september 2004 we strengthened our position in denver colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp inc a local comparable sales information provider in january 2005 we acquired national research bureau a leading provider of us shopping center information additionally in december 2006 our uk subsidiary costar limited acquired grecam sas “grecam” a provider of commercial property information and marketlevel surveys studies and consulting services located in paris france in february 2007 costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited “propex” a provider of commercial property information and operator of an online investment property exchange located in london england the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section under the heading “recent acquisitions” 

 

in 2004 we began our expansion into 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the us as well as expanding the geographical coverage of many of our existing us and uk markets in the first quarter of 2006 our expansion into the 21 new markets was complete 

 

in early 2005 we announced the launch of a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information the new retail component of our flagship product costar property professional was unveiled in may 2006 at the international council of shopping centers’ convention in las vegas 

during the second half of 2006 we began actively researching commercial properties in 81 new core based statistical areas “cbsas” in the us increased our us field research fleet by adding 89 vehicles and hired researchers to staff these vehicles in march 2007 we signed a longterm lease for a new research facility in white marsh maryland in support of our expanded research efforts and hired and trained additional researchers and other personnel we released our costar property professional service in the 81 new cbsas across the us in the fourth quarter of 2007 in an effort to further expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings including our retail service 

we believe that there is opportunity to capture potential revenue from prospective customers for our service in our current markets we have restructured and expanded our field sales force in the us to take advantage of this market opportunity in the fourth quarter of 2006 we began rapidly expanding the size of our sales force and have since doubled its size sales representatives with less than a year of experience tend to be less productive than representatives with more than a year of experience we expect that productivity per sales person will increase over the next year 

in connection with our recent acquisitions of propex and grecam we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk integrate our international operations more fully with those of the us and eventually to introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings we recently introduced the costar group as the “brand” encompassing our international operations 

to cost effectively manage the growth of our international operations we opened a research operations center in glasgow scotland in 2007 rather than expand our operations in london during the third quarter of 2007 we took steps to consolidate and streamline our international operations as a result of these steps certain management and staff positions in the uk were made redundant which reduced certain costs and the amount of office space required in london on september 14 2007 costar uk limited a wholly owned uk subsidiary of costar entered into an agreement to assign the leasehold for our london office in mayfair effective december 19 2007 costar uk limited assigned its lease interest in that office space in exchange for a payment of 76 million net of expenses we consolidated our london offices in mayfair and sheen into one facility in central london we expect to gain operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 

our expansion into 81 new cbsas expansion of our coverage in existing markets sales force expansion and expansion and integration of our international operations has caused our costs in 2007 to escalate over costs in 2006 however as we complete these initiatives and the related costs stabilize we believe they will facilitate the generation of additional revenue and provide a platform for earnings growth our 2007 results reflect growth in earnings as a result of these investments in our business and we expect revenues to continue to grow over what is now a relatively fixed cost base for our us research operations 

although we do not currently plan to initiate new significant investments through 2008 we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services expand existing services within our current platform consider strategic acquisitions and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization any future expansion could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings in to remain profitable driving overall earnings growth throughout 2008 and providing substantial cash flow for our business it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

 

we expect 2008 revenue to grow over 2007 revenue as a result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform successful cross selling of our services to our existing customer base continued depth of coverage and acquisitions we expect that 2008 ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization will increase over 2007 based on the growth in ebitda from us operations we anticipate that our ebitda for our existing core us platform will continue to grow principally due to growth in revenue we believe the company is well positioned to generate continued sustained earnings through the end of 2008 

 

we currently issue restricted stock and stock options to our officers directors and employees and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations we plan to continue the use of alternative stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income we incurred approximately 54 million in total equity compensation expense in 2007 

 

our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional focus services and propex services currently generate approximately 95 of our total revenues our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2007 our contract renewal rate was over 90 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable judgments made by the company relate to the expected useful lives of longlived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by the factors listed below 

 

 

 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 

 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by operating segment on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is morelikelythan not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statements of operations 

at december 31 2007 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 149 million which we expect to use during 2008 

as a result we expect cash payments for taxes during 2008 of approximately 120 million because our us taxable income will no longer be absorbed by carryforward losses our uk operations are expected to generate net operating losses for the full year 2008 losses in the uk will generate a lower tax benefit than if the costs were incurred in the us thereby creating a higher effective tax rate in 2008 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases currently the nongaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda which is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 

we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss in calculating ebitda we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 

ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 20 years building 

 

 

our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses due to the expansion of our information services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and nonoperating items such as interest and income taxes provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 

 

 

 

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by using a nongaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

comparison of year ended december 31 2007 and year ended december 31 2006 

revenues  revenues grew 213 to 1928 million in 2007 from 1589 million in 2006 this increase in revenue has resulted from continued penetration of our subscriptionbased information services the successful crossselling of additional products and services to our existing customer base combined with a continued high renewal rate and additional revenues from acquired companies including grecam acquired in december 2006 and propex acquired in february 2007 our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar 

  

  

 

property professional costar tenant costar comps professional focus services and propex services as of december 31 2007 our subscriptionbased information services represented approximately 95 of our total revenues 

gross margin  gross margin increased to 1161 million in 2007 from 1028 million in 2006 the gross margin percentage decreased to 602 in 2007 from 647 in 2006 the increase in the gross margin amount resulted principally from revenue growth from our subscriptionbased information services partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues the decrease in gross margin percentage was principally due to an increase in the cost of revenues to 767 million for 2007 from 561 million for 2006 the increase in cost of revenues resulted from increased research department hiring training compensation and other operating costs principally in connection with our retail and 81 new cbsa expansions and our international expansion as well as increased cost structures associated with the acquisitions of grecam and propex 

selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses increased to 518 million in 2007 from 418 million in 2006 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 269 in 2007 from 263 in 2006 the increase in the amount of selling and marketing expenses is primarily due to increased growth in the sales force increased marketing efforts as well as increased cost structures associated with the acquisition of propex 

software development expenses  software development expenses increased to 125 million in 2007 from 120 million in 2006 and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 65 in 2007 from 76 in 2006 the increase in the amount of software development expenses was primarily due to increased costs associated with the continued development of an international platform the decrease in the percentage was primarily due to our continued efforts to control and leverage our costs 

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased to 366 million in 2007 from 307 million in 2006 and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues to 190 in 2007 from 193 in 2006 the increase primarily includes increases in personnel expenses cost structures associated with the acquisition of propex and equity compensation 

gain on lease settlement net on september 14 2007 costar limited a wholly owned uk subsidiary of costar entered into an agreement with trafigura limited to assign to trafigura our leasehold interest in the office space located in london the lease assignment was effective on december 19 2007 as a result costar uk was paid 76 million net of expenses for the assignment of the lease there were no gains on lease settlements in 2006 

purchase amortization purchase amortization increased to 51 million in 2007 from 42 million in 2006 and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at 26 in 2007 and 2006 this increase in the amount was due to the acquisitions of grecam and propex 

interest and other income net interest and other income net increased to 80 million in 2007 from 68   million in 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher total shortterm investment balances for 2007 and increased interest rates for 2007 as compared to 2006 

income tax expense net income tax expense net increased to 99 million in 2007 from 85 million in 2006 this increase was due to higher income before income taxes for 2007 partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rate was lower in 2007 due to the gain on lease settlement in the uk that was completed in december 2007 the lease settlement resulted in income in the uk which reduced the overall effective tax rate 

comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31 2007 and year ended december 31 2006 

due to the increased size complexity and funding requirements associated with our international expansion in 2007 we began to manage our business geographically in two operating segments with our primary areas of measurement and decisionmaking being the us and international which includes the uk and france management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and segment ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization management believes that 

 

 

segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

segment revenues  us revenues increased to 1703 million from 1461 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in us revenue is due to further penetration of our us subscriptionbased information services and the successful crossselling into our customer base across our service platform in existing markets combined with a continued high renewal rate international revenues increased to 225 million from 128 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in international revenue is principally a result of a combination of further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services in the uk and the acquisitions of grecam and propex 

segment ebitda us ebitda increased to 329 million from 262 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in us ebitda was due to increased revenues partially offset by increased research costs and growth in our sales force as a result of our expansion international ebitda increased to 11 million from a loss of 315000 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase is primarily due to the assignment of our lease to trafigura offset by our increased investment in international expansion international ebitda also includes a corporate allocation of approximately 26 million and 10 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the corporate allocation represents costs incurred for us employees involved in international management and expansion activities

revenues revenues grew 183 to 1589 million in 2006 from 1343 million in 2005 this increase in revenue is principally due to further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services as well as the successful cross selling to our customer base across our service platform in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates our subscriptionbased information services consist primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services as of december 31 2006 our subscriptionbased information services represented 96 of our total revenues

method over ten years the grecam and propex acquired trade names are being amortized on a straightline basis over three years goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of grecam and propex have been consolidated with those of the company since the respective dates of the acquisitions and are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements of the company accordingly pro forma financial information has not been presented for either acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 1874 million at december 31 2007 compared to 1581 million at december 31 2006 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased principally as a result of ebitda interest income and proceeds from exercise of stock options partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets cash used for the purchase of propex for approximately 167 million capital expenditures and changes in working capital accounts 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 518 million compared to 328 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 190 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increased earnings before noncash charges for taxes stock based compensation provision for losses on accounts receivable depreciation and amortization and the 76 million net gain from lease settlement partially offset by the net effect of changes in working capital 

net cash used in investing activities was 404 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 285 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this 119 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was due to the acquisition of propex for approximately 167 million net of acquired cash increased purchases of shortterm investments and increased purchases of property and equipment 

net cash provided by financing activities was 82   million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 56 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the higher net cash produced by financing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is due to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

 

1 amounts do not include current purchase obligations that may be renewed on the same or different terms or terminated by us or a third party 

 

during 2007 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 143 million including expenditures related to our expansion support for our existing operations as well as building photography we expect to make capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately 80 million to 90 million including investments in facilities building photography network equipment and workstations to support ongoing operations 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we expect to use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

  

  

as of february 22 2008 we had 331 million of shortterm investments in studen loan auction rate securities and 291 million of these securities failed to settle at auctions these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education while we continue to earn interest on these investments the investments are not liquid in the short term in the event we need to immediately access these funds we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 

at december 31 2007 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 149 million which we expect to use during 2008 as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be approximately 120 million during 2008 because our us taxable income will no longer be absorbed by carryforward losses 

inflation may affect the way we operate in the us and abroad in general we believe that over time we are able to increase the prices of our services to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations and we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on our operations in 2008 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” “fin 48” which became effective for our company as of january 1 2007 fin 48 addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under fin 48 we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin 48 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “ fair value measurements ” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements under gaap and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the effects of adoption will be determined by the types of instruments carried at fair value in our financial statements at the time of adoption as well as the method utilized to determine their fair values prior to adoption the adoption of sfas 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “ fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 ”   “sfas 159” which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 31 2007 we have assessed the provisions of sfas 159 and determined that it is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “ business combinations” “sfas 141r” which will change the accounting for any business combination we enter into with an acquisition date after december 31 2008 under sfas 141r an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions sfas 141r will change the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination sfas 141r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but its effect will be dependent upon the specifics of any business combination with an acquisition date subsequent to the date of adoption 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the adoption of sfas 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

we have a substantial amount of intangible assets although as of december 31 2007 we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge for the excess amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

industry overview 

 

the market for commercial real estate information is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 

 

 

 

the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining its extensive database approximately 849 researchers technological expertise and broad customer base costar believes that it has created such a platform 

   

costar’s comprehensive database 

 

costar has spent more than 19 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

 

as of january 31 2007 our database of real estate information covered 66 us markets as well as london england and other parts of the united kingdom and france and contained 

 

  

this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as 

 

 

 

costar research 

 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2006 our full time researchers and contractors drove over three million miles conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections and interviewed millions of tenants owners and brokers 

 

research department as of january 31 2007 we employed 849 commercial real estate research professionals our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails internet updates and faxes each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the database as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers in 2006 we began outsourcing a limited number of research related projects to outside firms to supplement the work of our research employees 

 

costar has an extensive field research effort that permits physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional inventory photograph properties and verify existing information costar’s research 

  efforts have traditionally focused on office and industrial properties following our acquisition of national research bureau in january 2005 we launched a major expansion effort into real estate information for retail properties in july 2006 we announced our intention to commence actively researching commercial properties in approximately 100 new msas across the united states in an effort to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings including our new retail service 

 

as part of costar’s recent expansion efforts costar has deployed 155 hightech field research vehicles in 43 states and the united kingdom 103 of these vehicles are customdesigned energy efficient hybrid cars that come equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps some of our researchers also use customdesigned trucks with the same equipment as well as pneumatic masts that extend up to an elevation of twentyfive feet to allow for unobstructed building photographs from “birdseye” views each costar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite in addition many of our field researchers are photographers who take photographs of commercial real estate properties to add to costar’s database of digital images since we began our 21market expansion in may 2004 and continuing with our current expansion into an additional 100 msas our field researchers have photographed approximately 409000 buildings and researched over 82 billion square feet of gross building area in the expansion markets 

 

data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from two to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

 

management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include 

 

  

finally one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day

 11 

   

  

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies

risk factors 

 

our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2007 we expect to expand into 100 new msas in the us expand geographic coverage in the uk and france and certain of our existing markets and increase the depth of our coverage in certain of our existing markets if we are unable to manage these expansion efforts effectively if the expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand into these new markets or to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

 

our continuing expansion into the retail real estate sector may not be completed successfully or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition expanding into the retail real estate sector imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during the next year we expect to significantly expand the number of retail properties contained within our database if we are unable to manage this expansion plan effectively if this expansion effort takes longer than planned or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand into the retail sector and we are not successful in marketing and selling our expanded services or customers fail to accept these new services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

 

our revenues and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information services our subscriptionbased information services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients in planned expansion markets and our clients in existing markets may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue growth rate we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base as a result of several factors including without limitation a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or economic or competitive pressures if clients decide to cancel or not to renew their agreements and we do not attract new clients or sell new services to our existing clients then our revenues or our revenue growth rate may decline 

 

if our operating costs are higher than we expect our profitability may be reduced many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses additionally we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot 

  be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 

 

general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including inflation interest rates perceived and actual economic conditions taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue if clients choose to cancel our information services as a result of economic conditions and we do not acquire new clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected 

 

a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services a reversal of recent improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates or renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers both of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our information services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability 

 

international expansion may result in new business risks which may reduce our profitability our international operations and expansion could subject us to new business risks including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the united states currency exchange rate fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our growth successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 

 

if we are not able to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland grecam in france and property investment exchange limited in the uk the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets 

 

technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our web site the internet and our service providers problems with our web site the internet or the 

  services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree despite careful development and testing we cannot be certain that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems for example during the fourth quarter of 2006 as part of our upgrade to costar comps we integrated our internal research application used by our research staff to update our database of commercial real estate information if this application does not continue to work properly the ability of our clients to access our services may be affected which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

 

temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs 

 

changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example in the first quarter of 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas 123r which required us to expense the value of granted stock options we recorded 29 million in compensation charges for stock options in 2006 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a onetime income tax credit of 167 million primarily related to the release of our previously recorded valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards and as a result our net income for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2004 was significantly higher than in previous periods as a result of the release of our previously recorded valuation allowance we record income tax expense at an effective tax rate that approximates the statutory tax rates but can fluctuate on an overall basis 

 

competition could render our services uncompetitive the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

 

if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information services our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses in november 2006 we integrated our internal research processes that our us researchers use to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this new application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs 

   

we have experienced operating losses and our future profitability is uncertain until the third quarter of 2003 we had not recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new information services had caused our expenses to exceed our revenues our ability to continue to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to manage our growth including our expansion plans and to generate revenues that exceed our expenses we generated net income for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 and our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in 2004 was based on our expectation of future taxable income from operations however we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter and if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will continue to be profitable then the realization of our deferred tax assets could become uncertain in such a case we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred tax assets which could result in a significant charge to our earnings that could adversely affect our net income in the period in which the charge is incurred in addition our ability to continue to earn a profit to increase revenues or to control costs could be affected by the factors set forth in this section we may not be able to generate revenues or control expenses to a degree sufficient to earn a profit to increase profits on a quarterly or annual basis or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth and as a result the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected we cannot assure you that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover any litigation claims 

 

if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected in order to support revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase 

 

our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plans data quality the development of our sales force managerial execution employee retention foreign currency fluctuations inflation successful adoption of and training on our services litigation acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income including without limitation changes requiring us to expense stock options fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

 

we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we 

  cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues or our revenue growth rate and by reducing our profitability 

 

fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition due to our acquisition of focus information scottish property network “spn” grecam sas and property investment exchange limited “propex” a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and euro and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition currencies may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound or euro may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 

 

if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information services and could reduce our profitability 

 

our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management webdevelopment marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

 

we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information because the content in our database is distributed to others we may be subject to claims for defamation negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or information on our web site supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information services to users 

 

market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate 

  widely based on numerous factors including quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights regulatory developments and economic or other factors in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies

overview 

 

costar is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and the united kingdom based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available have the largest research department in the industry provide more information services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors we have created a standardized information platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information tenant information information about properties for sale information for clients’ web sites information about industry professionals and their business relationships analytic information data integration property marketing and industry news our service offerings span all commercial property types — office industrial retail land mixeduse hospitality and multifamily 

 

since 1994 we have expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information services in addition to internal growth this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource inc in chicago in 1996 and new market systems inc in san francisco in 1997 in august 1998 we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houstonbased real estate information provider c data services inc in january 1999 we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend inc and into atlanta and dallasfort worth by acquiring jamison research inc in february 2000 we acquired comps a san diegobased provider of commercial real estate information in november 2000 we acquired first image technologies inc in september 2002 we expanded further into portland oregon through the acquisition of certain assets of napier realty advisors dba realnet in january 2003 we established a base in the united kingdom with our acquisition of londonbased property intelligence in may 2004 we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research inc and in september 2004 we extended our coverage of the united kingdom through the acquisition of scottish property network in september 2004 we strengthened our position in denver colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp inc a local comparable sales information provider in january 2005 we acquired national research bureau “nrb” a leading provider of us shopping center information additionally in december 2006 our uk subsidiary costar limited acquired grecam sas “grecam” located in paris france a provider of commercial property information and marketlevel surveys studies and consulting services in february 2007 costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited “propex” a provider of commercial property information and operator of an investment property exchange located in london england the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section 

 

our current expansion plan began in 2004 and included entering 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the united states as well as expanding the geographical boundaries of many of our existing us and uk markets during 2005 and 2006 as of february 2006 our expansion into the 21 new markets was complete 

   

in early 2005 we announced the launch of a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information the new retail component of our flagship product costar property professional was unveiled in may 2006 at the international council of shopping centers’ convention in las vegas 

 

in july 2006 we announced our intention to commence actively researching commercial properties in approximately 100 new metropolitan statistical areas “msas” across the united states in an effort to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings including our new retail service during 2006 in connection with our plan to actively research commercial properties in these new msas we increased our us field research fleet by adding 89 vehicles and hired researchers to staff these vehicles further in support of our expanded research efforts we opened a research facility under a shortterm lease in white marsh maryland and hired and trained additional researchers and other personnel we intend to enter into a longterm lease for a new research facility in white marsh maryland in 2007 

 

as a result of our recent acquisitions of propex and grecam we also intend to invest further in our uk and french operations and to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and france costar intends to integrate its uk and french operations more fully with those of the us and eventually to introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings 

 

our current expansion plan further geographical expansion into approximately 100 new msas expansion of coverage of retail real estate information expansion of our coverage in existing markets and expansion of our uk and french operations has caused and will continue to cause our cost structure to escalate in advance of the revenues that we expect to generate from these new markets and services which may reduce our earnings or earnings growth 

 

we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services expand existing services and coverage across our current markets expand geographically in the us and international markets consider strategic acquisitions and expand our sales and marketing organization any future significant expansion could reduce our profitability and significantly increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings in existing markets to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

 

we expect 2007 revenue to grow over 2006 revenue as a result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform successful cross selling of our services to our existing customer base continued geographic expansion and acquisitions we expect that 2007 ebitda which is our netincome before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization could increase from 2006 based on the growth in ebitda from us operations which will be partially offset by our plan to expand and integrate our uk and french operations we anticipate our ebitda for our existing core platform to continue to grow principally due to growth in revenue 

 

beginning on january 1 2006 we began accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires the recognition of the fair value of stockbased compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award upon adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations of approximately 35000 representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

 

in 2006 we issued restricted stock and stock options to our officers directors and employees and as a result we recorded additional compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations we plan to continue the use of alternative stockbased compensation for our officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations and reduce our net income we incurred approximately 42 million in total equity compensation expense in 2006 

 

our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate approximately 96 of our total revenues our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year 

  and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

 

for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2006 our contract renewal rate was over 90 

 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

 

  

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 

 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually on october 1 st of each year for impairment and may be tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment loss as the extent to which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must 

  establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

 

as of the fourth quarter of 2004 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2004 resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 262 million this included an income tax benefit of approximately 167 million that was recognized in our results from operations we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately 95 million as additional paidin capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options as of december 31 2006 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately 337000 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards at december 31 2006 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 431 million which expire if unused from the year 2013 through the year 2023 

 

our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset was based on our expectation that we will recognize taxable income from operations in the future which will enable us to use our net operating loss carryforwards we believe our expectation that we will recognize taxable income in the future is supported by our increase in net earnings over the last three years our revenue growth our renewal rates with our existing customers and our business model which permits some control over future costs we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the future tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets then we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of the deferred tax assets 

 

for the next two years however we expect the majority of our taxable income to be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states our uk expansion will generate net operating losses in the uk the loss in the uk will generate a lower tax benefit than if the costs were incurred in the us thereby creating a higher effective tax rate in 2007 

 

effective for fiscal quarters beginning after december 31 2006 we will adopt the provisions of fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we do not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

accounting for employee stock options 

 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 123r “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123r utilizing the modified prospective approach under the modified prospective approach sfas 123r applies to new stockbased compensation awards and to awards that were outstanding on january 1 2006 that are subsequently modified repurchased or cancelled under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of our sharebased compensation awards this model employs the following key assumptions expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years our stock price volatility and option lives and expected dividends involve management’s best estimates at that time all of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the blackscholes methodology and ultimately the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 

 

sfas 123r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest in order to determine the portion of options and stock units expected to vest we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 

   

if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases currently the nongaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda which is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 

 

we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss in calculating ebitda we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 

 

ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 18 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complimentary businesses due to the expansion of our information services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and nonoperating items such as interest and income taxes provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

 27 

   

  

management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by only using a nongaap measure to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

 

the following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues 

 

 

 

 

 

recent acquisitions 

 

national research bureau on january 20 2005 we acquired the assets of nrb a leading provider of property information to the shopping center industry from claritas inc for approximately 41 million in cash 

   

grecam sas on december 21 2006 our uk subsidiary costar limited acquired grecam a provider of commercial property information and marketlevel surveys studies and consulting services located in paris france we acquired all of the assets of grecam together with all outstanding capital stock for approximately 20 million in cash 

 

property investment exchange on february 16 2007 costar limited a wholly owned uk subsidiary of costar acquired all outstanding capital stock of propex a uk company from the shareholders of propex pursuant to a stock purchase agreement in exchange for consideration of approximately £11000000 approximately 220 million consisting of cash and 21526 shares of costar common stock the purchase price is subject to decrease based on propex’s net worth as of the closing date propex provides webbased commercial property information and operates an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of investment property in the uk its suite of electronic platforms and listing websites give users access to the uk commercial property investment and leasing markets 

 

accounting treatment all of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for using purchase accounting the purchase price for each of the acquisitions was allocated primarily to acquired database technology customer base and goodwill the acquired database technology for each acquisition is being amortized on a straightline basis over 5 years the customer base for each acquisition which consists of one distinct intangible asset composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over 10 years goodwill will not be amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of nrb and grecam have been consolidated with our results since the respective dates of acquisition the operating results of each of nrb and grecam are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements and accordingly pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of the acquisitions 

 

costar currently operates within one business segment due to the purchase of grecam in december of 2006 the purchase of propex in february of 2007 and the company’s plan to expand the uk operations in 2007 the company will operate in more than one segment in 2007 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 1581 million at december 31 2006 compared to 1342 million at december 31 2005 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased principally as a result of ebitda interest income and proceeds from exercise of stock options partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets cash used for the purchase of grecam and changes in working capital accounts 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 328 million compared to 229 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the 99 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increased earnings before noncash charges for taxes stock based compensation provision for losses on accounts receivable depreciation and amortization partially offset by the net effect of changes in working capital 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 285 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 387 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this 102 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to decreased net purchases and sales of shortterm investments and less cash used in acquisitions partially offset by increased purchases of property and equipment and other assets 

 

net cash provided by financing activities was 56 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 74 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the lower net cash produced by financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

   

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

during 2006 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 130 million including expenditures of approximately 78 million related to building photography costs and the purchase of field research vehicles and equipment in connection with our intention to actively research commercial properties in approximately 100 new msa’s across the united states and the remaining 52 million related to costs of supporting our existing operations we expect to make capital expenditures in 2007 totaling approximately 120 million including significant investments in expansion facilities building photography network equipment and workstations to support expansion and ongoing operations this estimate also includes 20 to 30 million in capital expenditures for the company’s uk operations 

 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we expect to use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

 

as of the fourth quarter of 2004 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2004 resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 262 million this included an income tax benefit of approximately 167 million that was recognized in our results from operations we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately 95 million as additional paidin capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options as of december 31 2006 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately 337000 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards at december 31 2006 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 431 million which expire if unused from the year 2013 through the year 2023 

 

for the next two years however we expect the majority of our taxable income to be absorbed by our net operating loss carryforwards as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states 

 

inflation may affect the way we operate in the us and abroad in general we believe that over time we are able to increase the prices of our services to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations and we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on our operations in 2007 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

we initially adopted the emerging issues task force “eitf” consensus on issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” on july 1 2004 and the financial accounting standards board staff position “fsp” eitf issue no 0311 effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain 

  investments” on september 30 2004 the consensus on issue no 031 applies to investments in marketable debt and equity securities as well as investments in equity securities accounted for under the cost method it provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss the guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments fsp eitf issue no 0311 delays the effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 which provide guidance for determining whether the impairment is other than temporary the measurement of an impairment loss and accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment application of these paragraphs was deferred pending issuance of proposed fsp eitf issue no 031a the adoption of eitf issue no 031 and fsp eitf issue no 0311 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition on november 3 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fsp eitf issue no 031a renamed as fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” which provides guidance effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2005 the adoption of this pronouncement has not had a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets — an amendment of apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions” “sfas 153” sfas 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of apb opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance sfas 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange sfas 153 is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after september 15 2005 and we were required to adopt it beginning january 1 2006 the adoption of sfas 153 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fin no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations “sfas 143”” “fin 47”” fin 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated any uncertainty about the amount andor timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists the liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2005 the adoption of fin 47 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections — a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” “sfas 154” sfas 154 replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle sfas 154 requires restatement of prior period financial statements unless impracticable for voluntary changes in accounting principle the retroactive application of a change in accounting principle should be limited to the direct effect of the change changes in depreciation amortization or depletion methods should be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate corrections of accounting errors will be accounted for under the guidance contained in apb opinion no 20 the effective date of this new pronouncement is for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 and prospective application is required the adoption of sfas 154 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions this interpretation 

  was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we do not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” or “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states of america and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements under gaap and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the effects of adoption will be determined by the types of instruments carried at fair value in our financial statements at the time of adoption as well as the method utilized to determine their fair values prior to adoption based on our current use of fair value measurements sfas 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we provide information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united states the united kingdom and france our functional currency for our operations in the united kingdom and france is the local currency as such fluctuations in the british pound and euro may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all as of december 31 2006 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included a gain from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 47 million 

 

we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december 31 2006 

 

we have a substantial amount of intangible assets although as of december 31 2006 we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge for the excess amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

  industry overview 

the market for commercial real estate information is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interact with each other on a continuous basis 

a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses including 

 

the commercial real estate and related business community generally has operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap 

the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining its extensive database approximately 713 researchers technological expertise and broad customer base costar believes that it has created such a platform 

costar’s comprehensive database 

costar has spent more than 18 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants and demand statistics as well as digital images 

as of january 30 2006 our database of real estate information covered 65 us markets as well as london england and other parts of the united kingdom and contained 

 

   

this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as 

 

costar research 

we have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multifaceted research process in 2005 our researchers drove over one million miles conducted hundreds of thousands of onsite building inspections examined tens of millions of public records and interviewed millions of tenants owners and brokers 

  research department as of february 1 2006 we employed 713 commercial real estate research professionals our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails internet updates and faxes each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the database as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers we also recently began outsourcing a limited number of research related projects to outside firms on a trial basis 

costar has an extensive field research effort that permits physical inspection of properties in order to research new markets find additional inventory photograph properties and verify existing information costar’s research efforts have traditionally focused on office and industrial properties following our acquisition of national research bureau in january 2005 we launched a major expansion effort into real estate information for retail properties costar intends to continue to expand its coverage of retail properties over the next several years 

some of our researchers use costar customdesigned trucks equipped with computers proprietary global positioning system tracking software high resolution digital cameras handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings geocode them and position them on digital maps and pneumatic masts that extend up to an elevation of twentyfive feet so as to allow for unobstructed building photographs from “bird’seye views” each costar truck uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building geocoding the building capturing “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite other researchers conduct fieldwork in county courthouses and public records offices in addition many of our field researchers are photographers who take photographs of commercial real estate properties to add to the collection of costar’s digital images in our database since we began our 21market expansion in may 2004 our field researchers have photographed approximately 246000 buildings and researched over 5 billion square feet of gross building area in the expansion markets 

  data and image providers we license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhance various costar services these license agreements generally grant us a nonexclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information services and include what we believe are standard terms such as a contract term ranging from two to five years automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage 

    management and quality control systems our research processes include automated and nonautomated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process a large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors including occupancy date conflicts available square footage greater than building area typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases we also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology our nonautomated quality control procedures include 

 

finally one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day 

proprietary technology

  competition 

the market for information services generally is competitive and rapidly changing in the commercial real estate industry the principal competitive factors for commercial real estate information services and providers are 

 

we compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies 

 

as the commercial real estate information marketplace develops additional competitors including companies which could have greater access to data financial product development technical or marketing resources than we do may enter the market and competition may intensify while we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors competition could materially harm our business

risk factors 

  our planned expansion into the retail real estate sector may not be completed successfully or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  expanding into the retail real estate sector imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during the next year we expect to significantly expand the number of retail properties contained within our database if we are unable to manage this expansion plan effectively if this expansion effort takes longer than planned or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand into the retail sector and we are not successful in marketing and selling our expanded services or customers fail to accept these new services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

  our recently completed 21market expansion and any further geographic expansion or investment of resources to expand the depth of our coverage within existing markets may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during 2006 we expect to continue to expand into a number of new us markets expand geographic coverage in certain of our existing markets and increase the depth of our coverage in certain of our existing markets if we are unable to manage these expansion efforts effectively if the expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations our financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand into these new markets or to improve data quality within existing markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability 

  technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our web site the internet and our service providers problems with our web site the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree despite careful development and testing we cannot be certain that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems for example during the second quarter of 2005 we upgraded our internal research application used by our research staff to update our database of commercial real estate information if this application does not continue to work properly the ability of our clients to access our services may be affected which could result in 

  reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs 

  temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs 

  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline for example beginning in the first quarter of 2006 the company expects to adopt the provisions of sfas 123r which will require us to expense the value of granted stock options the company is continuing to assess the impact of the adoption of sfas 123r but currently expects to incur 30 to 40 million in charges for stock options granted in 2006 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a onetime income tax credit of 167 million primarily related to the release of our previously recorded valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards and as a result our net income for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2004 was significantly higher than in previous periods as a result of the release of our previously recorded valuation allowance we expect to record income tax expense for subsequent periods at an effective tax rate that approximates the statutory tax rate which will decrease our net income 

  our revenues and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information services our subscriptionbased information services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients in planned expansion markets and our clients in existing markets may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue growth rate we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base as a result of several factors including without limitation a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services customers’ and potential customers’ pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate andor financial services industries data quality technical problems or economic or competitive pressures if clients decide to cancel or not to renew their agreements and we do not attract new clients or sell new services to our existing clients then our revenues or our revenue growth rate may decline 

  if our operating costs are higher than we expect our profitability may be reduced  many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses additionally we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 

  general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including inflation interest rates perceived and actual economic conditions taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more 

  rapidly than expected the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue if clients choose to cancel our information services as a result of economic conditions and we do not acquire new clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected 

  a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  a reversal of recent improvements in the commercial real estate industry’s leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates or renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers both of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our information services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability 

  competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability 

  if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses in april 2005 we deployed a new companywide internal research application for our us researchers to use to update our database any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with this new application could reduce the quality of our data which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs in addition in july 2005 we closed our mason ohio research center in an effort to reduce costs and improve the quality of our research operations if the consolidation of our research operations within our remaining research centers is unsuccessful our data quality may be affected which could result in reduced demand for our services 

  we have experienced operating losses and our future profitability is uncertain  until the third quarter of 2003 we had not recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new information services had caused our expenses to exceed our revenues our ability to continue to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to manage our growth including our expansion plans and to generate revenues that exceed our expenses we generated net income for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 and our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was based on our expectation of future taxable income from operations however we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter and if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will continue to be profitable then the realization of our deferred tax assets could become uncertain in such a case we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred tax assets which could result in a significant charge to our earnings that could adversely affect our net income in the period in which the charge is incurred in addition our ability to continue to earn a profit to increase revenues or to control costs could be affected by the factors set forth in this section we may not be able to generate revenues or control expenses to a degree sufficient to earn a profit to increase profits on a quarterly or annual basis or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth and as a result the market price of our common stock may decline 

  litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are a party to various lawsuits any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money to defend could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect 

  our stock price in addition if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected we cannot assure you that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover any litigation claims 

  if we are unable to hire qualified persons for or retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected  in order to support revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to grow and manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force including sales force management or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could decline or cease to grow and our expenses could increase 

  our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plans data quality the development of our sales force managerial execution employee retention foreign currency fluctuations inflation successful adoption of and training on our services litigation acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income including without limitation changes requiring us to expense stock options fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

  we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues or our revenue growth rate and by reducing our profitability 

  fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  due to our acquisition of focus information and scottish property network “spn” a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition currencies may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we do not have any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future further significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 

  if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a 

  combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information services and could reduce our profitability 

  if we are not able to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets 

  our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance and our other officers and key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management webdevelopment marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees 

  international expansion may result in new business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international expansion could subject us to new business risks including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the united states currency exchange rate fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our growth successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 

  we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is distributed to others we may be subject to claims for defamation negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or information on our web site supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information services to users 

    market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights regulatory developments and economic or other factors in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies

overview 

costar is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and the united kingdom based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available have the largest research department in the industry provide more information services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors we have created a standardized information platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information tenant information information about properties for sale information for clients’ web sites information about industry professionals and their business relationships analytic information data integration property marketing and industry news

from 1994 through the beginning of 2003 we expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information services in addition to internal growth this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource inc in chicago in 1996 and new market systems inc in san francisco in 1997 in august 1998 we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houstonbased real estate information provider c data services inc in january 1999 we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend inc and into atlanta and dallasfort worth by acquiring jamison research inc in february 2000 we acquired comps a san diegobased provider of commercial real estate information in november 2000 we acquired first image technologies inc “first image” in september 2002 we expanded further into portland oregon through the acquisition of certain assets of napier realty advisors dba realnet “realnet” in january 2003 we established a base in the united kingdom with our acquisition of londonbased property intelligence in may 2004 we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research inc “peermark” and in june 2004 we extended our coverage of the united kingdom through the acquisition of scottish property network “spn” in september 2004 we strengthened our position in denver colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp inc a local comparable sales information provider in january 2005 we acquired national research bureau “nrb” a leading provider of us shopping center information the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section 

  since our inception the growth of our business has required substantial investments for the expansion of our services and the establishment of operating regions throughout the united states which resulted in substantial net losses on an overall basis until 2003 throughout 1999 and 2000 we experienced a rapid expansion in the number of services that we offered and the number of regions in which we operated by the beginning of 2001 we had substantially established a national platform of service offerings in 50 us metropolitan markets from 2001 through 2003 we focused on continuing to grow revenue while controlling and reducing costs in order to reduce operating losses and become profitable in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” our net income increased from 100000 for the year ended december 31 2003 to 250 million for the year ended december 31 2004 net income in 2004 included a onetime income tax benefit of 167 million which was the result of the release of a substantial portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforwards in addition we increased ebitda net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by 66 million from 132 million in 2003 to 198 million in 2004 our use of nongaap financial measures is discussed later in this section 

prior to 2003 our calculations of weightedaverage outstanding shares for basic and diluted net loss per share were identical because stock options that would have had an antidilutive effect on the calculation were properly excluded from the calculation we achieved net income for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 and as a result our calculation of weightedaverage outstanding shares for diluted net income per share included the effect of any dilutive stock options which are any outstanding stock options that have an exercise price lower than the average market price of our common stock for the period presented we expect that our diluted net income per share will be lower than our basic net income per share for any future periods in which we report net income due to the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options 

our current expansion plan began in 2004 and included entering 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the united states as well as expanding the geographical boundaries of many of our existing us and uk markets during 2005 and 2006 as of february 21 2006 our expansion into the 21 new markets is complete in addition in january 2005 we acquired nrb and announced the launch of a major expansion effort into real estate information for retail properties our current retail expansion plan has caused and will continue to cause our cost structure to escalate in advance of the revenues that we expect to generate from these new markets and services reducing our earnings growth 

we expect 2006 revenue to grow over 2005 revenue as a result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform as well as successful cross selling of our services to our existing customer base and continued geographic expansion we expect ebitda for our existing core platform to continue to grow principally due to growth in revenue and we expect overall 2006 ebitda to increase from 2005 ebitda including stock option compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 123r the 2005 ebitda did not include stock option compensation expense 

in addition to our current planned retail expansion we may continue further geographic expansion in the united states we may seek additional international geographic expansion or we may seek to expand our services any future significant expansion could reduce our profitability and significantly increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings in existing markets to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 

our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate approximately 95 of our total revenues our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 

for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2005 our contract renewal rate was over 90 

  application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

 

when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

as of the fourth quarter of 2004 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 262 million this included an income tax benefit of approximately 167 million that was recognized in our results from operations we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately 95 million as additional paidin capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to 

  tax deductions for stock options as of december 31 2005 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately 687000 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards at december 31 2005 the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 630 million which expire if unused from the year 2013 through the year 2023 

our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset was based on our expectation that we will recognize taxable income from operations in the future which will enable us to use our net operating loss carryforwards we believe our expectation that we will recognize taxable income in the future is supported by our increase in net earnings over the last three years our revenue growth our renewal rates with our existing customers and our business model which permits some control over future costs we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the future tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets then we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of the deferred tax assets 

for the foreseeable future we expect to record income tax expense on our results from operations at an effective rate of approximately 425 to 435 for the next several years however we expect the majority of our taxable income to be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states 

accounting for employee stock options 

as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” we currently account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “apb no 25” “accounting for stock issued to employees” under apb no 25 we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date we disclose the required pro forma information in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 had been applied 

effective for the fiscal quarters beginning after december 31 2005 pursuant to sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” the company will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the company is continuing to assess the impact of the adoption of sfas no 123r in 2005 however the company currently expects to incur approximately 30 to 40 million for stock option compensation expense in 2006 

in 2005 we issued restricted stock instead of stock options to our senior officers and employees as a result of which we recorded additional compensation expense on our consolidated statement of operations we plan to continue the use of alternative stockbased compensation for our senior officers directors and employees which may include among other things restricted stock grants which typically will require us to record additional compensation expense on our consolidated statement of operations and reduce our net income the company currently expects to incur approximately 20 million for restricted stock compensation expense in 2006 

nongaap financial measures 

we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases currently the nongaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda which is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 

we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss in calculating ebitda we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be 

  considered as a measure of liquidity as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 

ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 18 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complimentary businesses due to the expansion of our information services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and nonoperating items such as interest and income taxes provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 

set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this nongaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 

 

  management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by only using a nongaap measure to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 

the following table shows our ebitda reconciled to our net income and our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars 

 

our 2005 ebitda included a restructuring charge of approximately 22 million incurred in connection with the closing of our research center in mason ohio the restructuring charge included amounts for wages severance occupancy and other costs we did not incur any restructuring charges in 2004 or 2003 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue

  revenues revenues grew 199 from 1121 million in 2004 to 1343 million in 2005 this increase in revenue is principally due to further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services as well as the successful crossselling to our customer base across our service platform in existing markets combined with continued high renewal rates in addition nrb which was acquired in january 2005 contributed approximately 19 million of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate 95 of our total revenues

  income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit changed from a benefit of 169 million in 2004 to an expense of 43 million in 2005 income tax expense in 2005 is a result of our continued profitability combined with the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2004 

comparison of year ended december 31 2004 and year ended december 31 2003 

  revenues revenues grew 179 from 951 million in 2003 to 1121 million in 2004 this growth was principally the result of further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services into our existing and potential customer base as well as the successful crossselling of information services into our existing customer base across our service platform subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services generated approximately 95 of our total revenues in 2004

consolidated quarterly results of operations 

the following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts and as a percentage of total revenues 

 

   

recent acquisitions 

  peer market research inc on may 4 2004 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of peermark an online provider of commercial real estate information in nashville and memphis tennessee for 623000 in cash and 5318 shares of our common stock valued at approximately 207000 in the second quarter of 2005 we paid the peermark shareholders approximately 255000 in additional postclosing cash consideration pursuant to the peermark acquisition agreement 

  scottish property network on june 16 2004 our uk subsidiary acquired spn a provider of online commercial property information in scotland we acquired substantially all of the assets of the spn business together with all of the outstanding capital stock of spn for approximately 13 million in cash 

  realcomp inc on september 17 2004 we acquired substantially all of the assets of realcomp inc a local comparable sales information provider in denver colorado for approximately 350000 in cash 

  national research bureau on january 20 2005 the company acquired the assets of nrb a leading provider of property information to the shopping center industry from claritas inc for approximately 41 million in cash 

  accounting treatment all of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for using purchase accounting the purchase price for each of the acquisitions was allocated primarily to acquired database technology customer base and goodwill the acquired database technology for each acquisition is being amortized on a straightline basis over 5 years the customer base for each acquisition which consists of one distinct intangible asset composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over 10 years goodwill will not be amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of peermark spn realcomp and nrb have been consolidated with our results since the respective dates of acquisition the operating results of each of peermark spn realcomp and nrb are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements and accordingly pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of the acquisitions 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 1342 million at december 31 2005 compared to 1171 million at december 31 2004 from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 171 million principally as a result of ebitda of 191 million interest income and proceeds of 74 million from exercise of stock options partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets of approximately 84 million cash used for the purchase of nrb and changes in working capital accounts 

  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 229 million compared to 247 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 18 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to changes in working capital accounts partially offset by an increase in income before income taxes as a result of revenue growth resulting growth in gross margin and income from operations and interest income 

net cash used in investing activities was 387 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 299 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this 88 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to the increase in net purchases and sales of shortterm investments and increased cash used in acquisitions offset by decreased purchases of property and equipment and other assets 

net cash provided by financing activities was 74 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 63 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the higher net cash produced by financing activities in 2005 over 2004 is due to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

 

on february 23 2005 the company entered into an operating lease agreement pursuant to which the company has agreed to lease approximately 33371 square feet of office space located in columbia maryland the lease has an initial term of 99 months and an initial base rent of 2275 per rentable square foot per year additionally the company has a conditional option both to terminate the lease approximately five years after commencement of the initial term and to renew the lease for an additional five year period after expiration of the initial term 

during 2005 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 84 million including expenditures of approximately 48 million related to building photography costs and the purchase of field research vehicles and equipment in connection with our 21market expansion and the remaining 36 million related to costs of supporting our existing operations we expect to make capital expenditures in 2006 totaling approximately 120 to 150 million in connection with investments in assets required to support our existing operations and our geographic and retail expansion including building photography initial databases and communications and measuring photographic and computer equipment 

to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we expect to use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 

based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

as of the fourth quarter of 2004 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 262 million this included an income tax benefit of approximately 167 million that was recognized in our results from operations we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately 95 million as additional paidin capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to 

  tax deductions for stock options as of december 31 2005 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately 687000 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards at december 31 2005 the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 630 million which expire if unused from the year 2013 through the year 2023 

for the foreseeable future we expect to record income tax expense on our results from operations at an effective rate of approximately 425 to 435 for the next several years however we expect the majority of our taxable income to be absorbed by our net operating loss carryforwards as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states 

inflation may affect the way we operate in the us and the uk in general we believe that over time we are able to increase the prices of our services to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations and we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on our operations in 2006 

recent accounting pronouncements 

we initially adopted the emerging issues task force “eitf” consensus on issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” on july 1 2004 and the financial accounting standards board staff position “fsp” eitf issue no 0311 effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” on september 30 2004 the consensus on issue no 031 applies to investments in marketable debt and equity securities as well as investments in equity securities accounted for under the cost method it provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss the guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments fsp eitf issue no 0311 delays the effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 which provide guidance for determining whether the impairment is other than temporary the measurement of an impairment loss and accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment application of these paragraphs is deferred pending issuance of proposed fsp eitf issue no 031a the adoption of eitf issue no 031 and fsp eitf issue no 0311 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations on november 3 2005 the fasb issued fsp eitf issue no 031a renamed as fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” which provides guidance effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2005 the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fas 1151 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets—an amendment of apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions” “sfas 153” sfas 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of apb opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance sfas 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange sfas 153 is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 and the company is required to adopt it beginning january 1 2006 the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas 153 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections—a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” “sfas 154” sfas 154 replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle sfas 154 requires restatement of prior period financial statements unless impracticable for voluntary changes in accounting principle the retroactive application of a change in accounting principle should be limited to the direct effect of the change changes in depreciation amortization or depletion methods should be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate corrections of accounting errors will be accounted for under the guidance 

  contained in apb opinion no 20 the effective date of this new pronouncement is for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 and prospective application is required we do not expect the adoption of sfas 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fin no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations “sfas no 143”” “fin 47” fin 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated any uncertainty about the amount andor timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists the liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of fin 47 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the company’s internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains “forwardlooking statements” including statements about our beliefs and expectations there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those stated below under the headings “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form 10k overview costar is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and the united kingdom based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available have the largest research department in the industry provide more information services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors we have created a standardized information platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease comparable sales information tenant information information about properties for sale information for clients’ web sites information about industry professionals and their business relationships analytic information data integration property marketing and industry news we completed our initial public offering in july 1998 and received net proceeds of approximately 227 million we used those net proceeds to fund the geographic and service expansion of our business including three strategic acquisitions and to expand our sales and marketing organization in may 1999 we completed a followon public offering and received net proceeds of approximately 974 million we used a portion of those net proceeds to fund the acquisitions of compscom inc “comps” and property intelligence plc “property intelligence” in november 2003 we completed an additional followon public offering and received net proceeds of approximately 535 million we expect to use the remainder of the proceeds from these public offerings for development and distribution of new services expansion of existing services across our current markets geographic expansion in the us and international markets strategic acquisitions working capital and general corporate purposes from 1994 through the beginning of 2003 we expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information services in addition to internal growth this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource inc in chicago in 1996 and new market systems inc in san francisco in 1997 in august 1998 we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houstonbased real estate information provider c data services inc in january 1999 we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend inc and into atlanta and dallasfort worth by acquiring jamison research inc in february 2000 we acquired comps a san diegobased provider of commercial real estate information in november 2000 we acquired first image technologies inc “first image” in september 2002 we expanded further into portland oregon through the acquisition of certain assets of napier realty advisors dba realnet “realnet” in january 2003 we established a base in the united kingdom with our acquisition of londonbased property intelligence in may 2004 we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research inc “peermark” and in june 2004 we extended our coverage of the united kingdom through the acquisition of scottish property network “spn” in september 2004 we strengthened our position in denver colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp inc a local comparable sales information provider in january 2005 we acquired national research bureau “nrb” a leading provider of us shopping center information the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section 15 

  since our inception the growth of our business has required substantial investments for the expansion of our services and the establishment of operating regions throughout the united states which resulted in substantial net losses on an overall basis until 2003 throughout 1999 and 2000 we experienced a rapid expansion in the number of services that we offered and the number of regions in which we operated by the beginning of 2001 we had substantially established a national platform of service offerings in 50 us metropolitan markets from 2001 through 2003 we focused on continuing to grow revenue while controlling and reducing costs in order to reduce operating losses and become profitable in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” our net income increased from 100000 for the year ended december 31 2003 to 250 million for the year ended december 31 2004 net income in 2004 included a onetime income tax benefit of 167 million which was the result of the release of a substantial portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforwards in addition we increased ebitda net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by 66 million from 132 million in 2003 to 198 million in 2004 our use of nongaap financial measures is discussed later in this section during 2004 we began the field research phase of our current geographic expansion plan the plan includes entering an expected 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the united states as well as expanding the geographical boundaries of many of our existing us markets and international expansion in manchester england in 2004 we began providing services in 2 new us markets and manchester england and during the next year we expect to begin providing services in the remaining markets in addition in january 2005 we acquired nrb and announced that we were launching a major expansion effort into real estate information for retail properties we generally have not experienced this type of internal expansion since 2000 our planned expansion has caused and will continue to cause our cost structure to escalate in advance of revenues that we expect to generate in these new markets and from providing these new services as we invest in future revenue growth for 2005 and beyond in addition the incremental costs of introducing new services or increasing geographic coverage in an existing market may further increase our operating cost structure and reduce the profitability of that market prior to the release of the additional service offerings or increase in market coverage as of the fourth quarter of 2004 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 262 million this included an income tax benefit of approximately 167 million that was recognized in our results from operations we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately 95 million as additional paidin capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options as of december 31 2004 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately 546000 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards for the foreseeable future we expect to record income tax expense on our results from operations at an effective rate of approximately 40 for the next several years however we expect the majority of our taxable income to be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states effective for fiscal quarters beginning after june 15 2005 pursuant to sfas no 123r“sharebased payment” the company will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the company is continuing to assess the impact of the adoption of sfas no 123r in 2005 however the company currently expects to incur approximately 37 million in charges in 2005 for stock option and other equity compensation expense beginning in the third quarter of 2005 as a result we are evaluating our compensation practices and may develop alternative stockbased employee compensation plans including without limitation the issuance of restricted stock which may result in recording additional expense to our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 16 

  we expect 2005 revenue to grow over 2004 revenue as a result of expected further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform as well as successful cross selling of our services into our existing customer base and continued geographic expansion and retail expansion we expect ebitda for our existing core platform to continue to grow due principally to growth in revenue however we expect 2005 ebitda to decrease from 2004 ebitda due to costs related to our expansion plan and our estimated 37 million charge for stock option and other equity compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 123r the 2004 ebitda did not include such compensation charges we expect 2005 net income to decrease over 2004 net income because in 2005 we will not have the 167 million income tax benefit that we recorded in 2004 in addition we expect to have an estimated 37 million charge for stock option and other equity compensation expense in 2005 that we did not incur in 2004 and we expect to record income tax expense on our results of operations for 2005 which we did not incur in 2004 both of which will lower our net income if we achieve our expected revenue growth and control our costs with respect to our current expansion plan we believe we will maintain positive cash flow from operating activities during 2005 prior to 2003 our calculations of weightedaverage outstanding shares for basic and diluted net loss per share were identical because stock options that would have had an antidilutive effect on the calculation were properly excluded from the calculation we achieved net income for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 and as a result our calculation of weightedaverage outstanding shares for diluted net income per share included the effect of any dilutive stock options which are any outstanding stock options that have an exercise price lower than the average market price of our common stock for the period presented we expect that our diluted net income per share will be lower than our basic net income per share for any future periods in which we report net income due to the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options in addition to our current planned geographic and retail expansion we may continue further geographic expansion in the united states we may seek additional international geographic expansion or we may seek to expand our services any future significant expansion could reduce our profitability and significantly increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings in existing markets to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future while our services continue to expand our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate approximately 95 of our total revenues our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 our contract renewal rate was 88 and 92 respectively application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates 17 

  we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following  when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually on october 1 st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations as of the fourth quarter of 2004 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 262 million this included an income tax benefit of approximately 167 million that was recognized in our results from operations we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately 95 million as additional paidin capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options as of december 31 2004 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately 546000 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset was based on our expectation that we will recognize taxable income from operations in the future which will enable us to use our net operating loss carryforwards we believe our expectation that we will recognize taxable income in the future is supported by our increase in net earnings over the last three years our revenue growth our renewal rates with our existing customers and our business model which permits some control over future costs we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the future tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets then we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of the deferred tax assets 18 

  accounting for employee stock options as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” we currently account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “apb no 25” “accounting for stock issued to employees” under apb no 25 we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date we disclose the required pro forma information in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 had been applied nongaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we have also disclosed and discussed certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases including ebitda which is our net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and pro forma earnings which is our net income before purchase amortization in cost of revenues purchase amortization in operating expenses and our income tax benefit we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission we have previously disclosed pro forma earnings in our earnings releases and investor conference calls from 2003 through 2004 we have experienced substantial year over year earnings growth as a result the impact of purchase amortization on our net income has become less meaningful therefore beginning with our first quarter 2005 earnings release we expect to no longer report pro forma earnings in our earnings releases or on our investor conference calls however we expect to continue to report ebitda in our earnings releases investor conference calls and our filings with the securities and exchange commission and reconcile ebitda to our net income the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose different nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations we view ebitda and pro forma earnings as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to them is net income loss in calculating ebitda and pro forma earnings we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda and pro forma earnings are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as measures of liquidity as alternatives to net income loss or as indicators of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda and pro forma earnings as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda and pro forma earnings ebitda and pro forma earnings have been used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 17 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complimentary businesses due to the expansion of our information services which included acquisitions our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization ebitda and pro forma earnings which exclude these charges provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization in addition in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recognized a onetime noncash income tax benefit for the release of our previously recorded valuation 19 

  allowance against our net loss carryforwards which we expect will be used to reduce future amounts of income taxes we would otherwise be required to pay and as a result of the recognition of this benefit our net income for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2004 was substantially higher than in the previous quarters because such one time income tax benefit is nonrecurring and a noncash benefit we have excluded such amount from the calculation of our pro forma earnings we believe the disclosure of ebitda and pro forma earnings helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe ebitda and pro forma earnings are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation nonoperating items such as interest and income taxes and noncash nonrecurring items such as the income tax benefit we recognized when we released our valuation allowance provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and pro forma earnings to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry finally management and the board of directors have used pro forma earnings and ebitda as two of several criteria for determining the achievement of performancebased cash bonuses set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and pro forma earnings and the material limitations associated with using these nongaap financial measures as compared to net income loss  management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by only using nongaap measures to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 20 

  the following table shows our ebitda reconciled to our gaap net income loss and our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars  

consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  

comparison of year ended december 31 2004 and year ended december 31 2003   revenues revenues grew 179 from 951 million in 2003 to 1121 million in 2004 this growth was principally the result of further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services into our existing and potential customer base as well as the successful crossselling of information services into our existing customer base across our service platform subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate approximately 95 of our total revenues   gross margin gross margin increased from 644 million in 2003 to 767 million in 2004 gross margin percentage also increased from 677 in 2003 to 684 in 2004 the increase in the gross margin amount and percentage resulted principally from internal revenue growth from our subscriptionbased information services cost of revenues increased from 307 million in 2003 to 354 million in 2004 principally due to increased research department hiring training compensation and other operating costs associated with our current expansion plan 21 

    selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased from 265 million in 2003 to 295 million in 2004 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 279 in 2003 to 263 in 2004 the increase in the amount of selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased sales commissions and marketing campaigns   software development expenses software development expenses increased from 69 million in 2003 to 85 million in 2004 and increased as a percentage of revenues from 73 in 2003 to 76 in 2004 this increase was due to the hiring of new employees to support our continued focus on enhancements to our existing services development of new services and development of our internal information systems   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from 265 million in 2003 to 277 million in 2004 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 278 in 2003 to 246 in 2004 the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses professional fees and increased occupancy costs offset by a decrease in bad debt expense   purchase amortization purchase amortization decreased from 45 million in 2003 to 44 million in 2004 this decrease was due to the complete amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets during 2003 and 2004   other income net interest and other income increased from 380000 in 2003 to 13 million in 2004 this increase was primarily a result of higher total cash balances in 2004 and higher interest rates during the year   income tax expense benefit income tax expense changed from an expense of 282000 in 2003 to a benefit of 169 million in 2004 the benefit is primarily due to the fourth quarter release of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforwards we released the valuation allowance because we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset through future taxable earnings comparison of year ended december 31 2003 and year ended december 31 2002   revenues revenues grew 198 from 794 million in 2002 to 951 million in 2003 this growth was the result of additional revenue from the property intelligence acquisition and further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services into our existing and potential customer base as well as the successful crossselling of information services into our existing customer base across our service platform revenues from our uk markets accounted for approximately 8 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services generated over 90 of our total revenues in 2003   gross margin gross margin increased from 514 million in 2002 to 644 million in 2003 gross margin percentage also increased from 647 in 2002 to 677 in 2003 the increase in the gross margin percentage and amount resulted principally from internal revenue growth from our subscriptionbased information services and was slightly offset by the addition of margins from our uk markets averaging approximately 60 cost of revenues increased from 280 million in 2002 to 307 million in 2003 principally due to the addition of cost of revenues from our uk markets as a result of the property intelligence acquisition which was slightly offset by a decrease in cost of revenues from our us markets   selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased from 232 million in 2002 to 265 million in 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 292 in 2002 to 279 in 2003 the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to the addition of approximately 14 million of selling and marketing expenses from our uk markets as a result of the property intelligence acquisition increased sales and marketing personnel costs and marketing campaigns surrounding the release of our webbased costar property professional service   software development expenses software development expenses increased from 55 million in 2002 to 69 million in 2003 and increased as a percentage of revenues from 70 in 2002 to 73 in 2003 this increase was due to the addition of uk software development expenses as a result of the property intelligence 22 

  acquisition and our continued focus on service enhancements and development as well as the support of internal information systems to manage the company’s growth   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from 246 million in 2002 to 265 million in 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 310 in 2002 to 278 in 2003 the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the addition of 28 million for uk general and administrative expenses as a result of the property intelligence acquisition which was offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses from our us markets primarily due to reductions in administrative headcount   purchase amortization purchase amortization increased from 36 million in 2002 to 45 million in 2003 this increase was due to increased purchase price amortization of identified intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of property intelligence and was partially offset by a decrease in purchase amortization resulting from the complete amortization of certain identified intangible assets during 2003   other income net interest and other income decreased from 759000 in 2002 to 380000 in 2003 this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash balances for the first three quarters of 2003 and lower interest rates during the year   income tax expense income tax expense increased from 0 in 2002 to 282000 in 2003 this increase is a result of the fact that we achieved taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 which caused us to incur income tax expense our total income tax expense was partially offset through the use of some of our net operating loss carryforwards because we are subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and because certain state and local tax jurisdictions do not recognize portions of our net loss carryforwards we were not able to completely offset our income tax liability through the use of our net operating loss carryforwards 23

  million in cash the acquisition will be accounted for using purchase accounting the purchase price will be principally allocated to various working capital accounts database technology customer base and goodwill   accounting treatment all of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for using purchase accounting the purchase price for each of the acquisitions was allocated primarily to acquired database technology and customer base the acquired database technology for each acquisition is being amortized on a straightline basis over 5 years the customer base for each acquisition which consists of one distinct intangible asset composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over 10 years goodwill will not be amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests the results of operations of peermark spn and realcomp have been consolidated with our results since the respective dates of acquisition the operating results of each of peermark spn and realcomp are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements and accordingly pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of the acquisitions liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 1171 million at december 31 2004 compared to 974 million at december 31 2003 from december 31 2003 to december 31 2004 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 197 million principally as a result of increased ebitda and proceeds of 63 million from employee stock option exercises to purchase approximately 425000 shares of common stock offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets of approximately 90 million and cash used in acquisitions net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was 247 million compared to 136 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this 111 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of revenue growth and resulting growth in gross margin which was principally due to the result of further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services into our existing and potential customer base as well as the successful crossselling of information services into our existing customer base across our service platform the increase in net cash produced by operating activities is also due to timing differences in payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses net cash used in investing activities was 299 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 655 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this 356 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to the decrease in net purchases and sales of shortterm investments net cash provided by financing activities was 63 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 618 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the higher net cash produced by financing activities in 2003 over 2004 is due to our november 2003 follow on public offering in which we issued 1667500 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of 535 million   contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands

  commencement of the initial term and to renew the lease for an additional five year period after expiration of the initial term during 2004 we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 90 million with approximately 53 million related to building photography costs and the purchase of field research vehicles and equipment in connection with our planned 21–market expansion and the remaining 37 million to support our existing operations capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to include investments in assets required to support our planned market expansion including additional field research vehicles building photography and initial databases and communications measuring photographic and computer equipment totaling approximately 80 million additionally we expect to incur approximately 40 million of capital expenditures during 2005 to support our existing operations to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we expect to use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months as of the fourth quarter of 2004 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 262 million this included an income tax benefit of approximately 167 million that was recognized in our results from operations we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately 95 million as additional paid–in capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options as of december 31 2004 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately 546000 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards for the foreseeable future we expect to record income tax expense on our results from operations at an effective rate of approximately 40 for the next several years however we expect the majority of our taxable income to be absorbed by our net operating loss carryforwards as a result we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations recent accounting pronouncements we initially adopted the emerging issues task force “eitf” consensus on issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” on july 1 2004 and the financial accounting standards board staff position “fsp” eitf issue no 0311 effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” on september 30 2004 the consensus on issue no 031 applies to investments in marketable debt and equity securities as well as investments in equity securities accounted for under the cost method it provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss the guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments fsp eitf issue no 0311 delays the effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 which provide guidance for determining whether the impairment is other than temporary the measurement of an impairment loss and accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment application of these paragraphs is deferred pending issuance of proposed fsp eitf issue no 031a the adoption of eitf issue no 031 and fsp eitf issue no 0311 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets—an amendment of apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions” “sfas 153” sfas 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of apb opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary 26 

  transactions” and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance sfas 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange sfas 153 is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 and the company is required to adopt it beginning january 1 2006 the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas 153 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact eitf issue no 041 “accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination” was issued in october 2004 this issue applies when two parties that have a preexisting contractual relationship enter into a business combination specifically the issue is whether a consummation of a business combination between two parties that have a preexisting contractual relationship should be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting contractual relationship exists thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination if separate accounting is required then the measurement of the settlement amount will be decided finally if it is determined that assets of the acquired entity that are related to a preexisting contractual relationship with the acquiring entity should be recognized as part of the business combination whether the acquiring entity should recognize those assets as intangible assets apart from goodwill will be decided the issue is effective for reporting periods beginning after october 13 2004 the company will assess the impact if applicable for business combinations occurring in 2005 in december 2004 fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” under previous practice the reporting entity could account for sharebased payment under the provisions of apb opinion no 25 and disclose pro forma sharebased compensation as accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 123 under the provisions of sfas no 123r a public entity is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award sfas no 123r is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after june 15 2005 as such the company expects to adopt its provisions for the fiscal quarter beginning july 1 2005 application of this pronouncement requires significant judgment regarding the inputs to an option pricing model including stock price volatility and employee exercise behavior most of these inputs are either highly dependent on the current economic environment at the date of grant or forwardlooking over the expected term of the award the company is continuing to assess the impact of the adoption of sfas no 123r in 2005 but currently expects to incur approximately 37 million in charges in 2005 for stock option and other equity compensation expense beginning in the third quarter of 2005 as a result the company is evaluating our compensation practices and may develop alternative stockbased employee compensation plans including without limitation the issuance of restricted stock which may result in recording

negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  expanding into new markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during the next year we expect to expand into a number of new us markets and expand geographic coverage in certain of our existing markets if we are unable to manage this expansion plan effectively if this expansion effort takes longer than planned or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand into these new markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability   our planned expansion into the retail real estate sector may not be completed successfully or may not result in increased revenues which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  expanding into the retail real estate sector imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources during the next two years we expect to significantly expand the number of retail properties contained within our database if we are unable to manage this expansion plan effectively if this expansion effort takes longer than planned or if our costs for this effort exceed our expectations our financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand into the retail sector and we are not successful in marketing and selling our expanded services or customers fail to accept these new services our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues adversely affecting our profitability   technical problems that affect either our customers’ ability to access our services or the software internal applications and systems underlying our services could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our web site the internet and our service providers problems with our web site the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information services in addition the software internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be efficient or errorfree moreover despite careful development and testing we cannot be certain that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software internal applications and systems for example we are currently upgrading our internal research application used by our research staff to update our database of commercial real estate information and in the event that problems occur during the deployment or future use of this application the ability of our clients to access our services may be affected which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs any inefficiencies errors or technical problems with 28 

  our software internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services which could reduce the demand for our services lower our revenues and increase our costs   temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information services lower revenues and increased costs   changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results which may affect our stock price  changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations for example beginning in the third quarter of 2005 the company expects to adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r which will require the company to expense the value of granted unvested stock options as a result the company expects to incur approximately 37 million in equity compensation charges which we expect will reduce our net income in addition in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a onetime income tax credit of 167 million primarily related to the release of our previously recorded valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards and as a result our net income for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2004 was significantly higher than in previous periods as a result in subsequent periods we expect to record income tax expense at an effective tax rate that would approximate the statutory tax rate which will decrease our net income   our revenues and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information services our subscriptionbased information services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients in planned expansion markets and our clients in existing markets may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services in addition in order to increase our revenue growth rate we must continue to attract new customers continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base as a result of several factors including without limitation a decision that customers have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate industry data quality technical problems or economic or competitive pressures if clients decide not to renew or cancel their agreements and we do not attract new clients or sell new services to our existing clients then our revenues or our revenue growth rate may decline   if our operating costs are higher than we expect our profitability may be reduced  many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses additionally we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs communications costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected   we have experienced operating losses and our future profitability is uncertain  until the third quarter of 2003 we had not recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new information services had caused our expenses to exceed our revenues our ability to continue to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to manage our growth including our expansion plans and to generate revenues that exceed our expenses we generated net income for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 and our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was based on our expectation of future taxable income from operations however we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter and if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will continue to be profitable then the realization of our deferred tax assets could become uncertain in such a case we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred tax assets which could result in a significant charge to our earnings which could adversely affect our net income in the period in which the charge 29 

  is incurred in addition our ability to continue to earn a profit to increase revenues or to control costs could be affected by the factors set forth in this section we may not be able to generate revenues or control expenses to a degree sufficient to earn a profit to increase profits on a quarterly or annual basis or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth and as a result the market price of our common stock may decline   a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate industry has stabilized in recent months as evidenced by improving leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates however a reversal of this trend or renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may continue to affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers both of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our information services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability   general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including inflation interest rates perceived and actual economic conditions taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability additionally any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses which may not be offset by increased revenues if clients choose to cancel our information services as a result of economic conditions and we do not acquire new clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected   if we are unable to hire retain and continue to develop our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could be adversely affected  in order to support revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to attract integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services our ability to retain an effective vice president of sales our ability to grow and manage effectively an outbound telesales group the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire develop or retain the members of our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could decline or cease to grow and our expenses could increase   competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability   our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our financial results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues technical problems with our services changes or consolidation in the real estate industry our investments in geographic expansion interest rate fluctuations the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plan the development of our sales force managerial execution data quality employee retention foreign currency fluctuations successful adoption of and training on the company’s services the timing of investing the net proceeds from our offerings acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client training and 30 

  support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income including without limitation changes requiring us to expense stock options fluctuations in our financial results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline   if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses in addition during 2005 we expect to deploy a new companywide internal research application for our us researchers to use to update our database in the event this software application is not deployed effectively if our researchers find the application difficult to use or if this application does not work properly our data quality may be affected which could result in reduced demand for our services lower revenues and higher costs   we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues or our revenue growth rate and by reducing our profitability   litigation or government investigations in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price  currently and from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business we cannot assure you that we will have any or sufficient insurance to cover our pending claims or our future claims any lawsuits threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price if any claims are determined against us our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected in addition governments in the united states or abroad could adopt laws that could harm our business by for example regulating the information we provide or regulating our transmissions over the internet or exposing our business to taxes in various jurisdictions compliance with any such laws could increase our costs or make our services less attractive   if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information services and could reduce our profitability   if we are not able to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions 31 

  of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as spn in scotland the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets   our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance our officers and other key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management webdevelopment marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees   international expansion may result in new business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international expansion could subject us to new business risks including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the united states currency exchange rate fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our growth successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition   fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  as a result of the property intelligence and spn subsidiaries a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition currencies may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we do not have any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future and significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries   we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is distributed to others we may be subject to claims for defamation negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or information on our web site supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information services to users   market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights regulatory developments and economic or other factors in addition 32 

  in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united states and the united kingdom our functional currency for our operations in the united kingdom is the local currency as such fluctuations in the british pound may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all as of december 31 2004 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included a gain from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 41 million we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december 31 2004 we have a substantial amount of intangible assets although as of december 31 2004 we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable changes in the economy the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired we would recognize an impairment charge for the excess amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets

the commercial real estate and related business community generally operates in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining its extensive database over 550 experienced researchers technological expertise and broad customer base costar believes that it has created such a platform costar’s comprehensive database costar has spent more than 16 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information which includes information on leasing sales comparable sales tenants demand statistics and digital images as of december 31 2003 our database of real estate information covered 50 us markets as well as london england and other parts of the united kingdom and contained  this highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields tracking such categories as

  services that we offer and the number of regions in which we operate by the beginning of 2001 we had substantially established a national platform of service offerings in 50 us metropolitan markets from which we believe we can appropriately meet the commercial real estate community’s needs for comprehensive us buildingspecific information from 2001 through 2003 we focused on continuing to grow revenue while controlling and reducing costs in order to reduce operating losses and become profitable in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” during 2003 our gaap net income increased from a net loss of 48 million for the year ended december 31 2002 to net income of 100000 for the year ended december 31 2003 in addition we increased ebitda net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by 70 million from 62 million in 2002 to 132 million in 2003 our use of nongaap financial measures is discussed later in this section beginning in 2004 we plan to further expand into 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the united states as well as expand the geographical boundaries of many of our existing us markets the field research phase of this expansion is expected to start in the second quarter of 2004 we generally have not experienced this type of internal geographic expansion since 2000 although we believe that a large component of our current operating cost structure is made up of fixed operating costs our planned 2004 expansion will cause our cost structure to escalate in advance of revenues in these 21 new metropolitan markets as we invest in future revenue growth opportunities for 2005 and beyond in addition the incremental costs of introducing new services in an existing market or increasing geographic coverage in an existing market may further increase our operating cost structure and reduce the profitability of an existing market prior to release of the additional service offerings or increasing market coverage we expect 2004 revenue to grow significantly over 2003 revenue as a result of expected further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform as well as the successful crossselling of our services into our existing customer base in addition we expect 2004 ebitda to significantly increase over 2003 ebitda and 2004 gaap net income to significantly increase over 2003 gaap net income each as a result of expected increased revenue growth coupled with a relatively fixed operating cost structure if we achieve our expected revenue growth and maintain a relatively fixed operating cost structure we believe we will maintain positive cash flow from operating activities throughout 2004 historically our calculations of weightedaverage outstanding shares for basic and diluted net loss per share have been identical because stock options that would have had an antidilutive effect on the calculation have been properly excluded from the calculation we achieved gaapbasis net income for the year ended december 31 2003 and as a result our calculation of weightedaverage outstanding shares for diluted net income per share includes the effect of any dilutive stock options which are any outstanding stock options that have an exercise price lower than the average market price of our common stock for the year ended december 31 2003 we expect that our diluted net income per share will be lower than our basic net income per share for any future periods in which we report gaapbasis net income due to the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options in addition our calculation of weightedaverage outstanding shares for basic and diluted net income per share for 2003 included the effect of the weightedaverage outstanding shares related to our november 2003 followon public offering in which we issued approximately 17 million shares of our common stock as a result of this share issuance we expect our calculation of weightedaverage outstanding shares for basic and diluted net income per share for 2004 to significantly increase compared to our calculation of weightedaverage outstanding shares for basic and diluted net income per share for 2003 in addition we achieved taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 which enabled us to utilize some of our net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes although our net operating loss carryforwards are substantial we are subject to limitations on their use in addition we are subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and state and local tax jurisdictions may not recognize portions of these loss carryforwards as a result we incurred income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2003 and expect to incur income tax expense in the future we continue to develop and distribute new services expand existing services across our us and uk markets and expand the geographic boundaries of our current markets the incremental cost of introducing new services expanding existing services or expanding geographic boundaries in the future may reduce the profitability of a region or cause it to incur losses in addition to our planned geographic expansion into 21 new metropolitan markets throughout the united states we may continue further geographic expansion in the united states or we may seek 16 

  additional international geographic expansion any future significant geographic expansion could also significantly increase our capital expenditures therefore while we expect current service offerings in existing regions to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future while our services continue to expand our subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate over 90 of our total revenues our contracts for our subscriptionbased information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically upon renewal many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscriptionbased services rather than fees based on actual system usage contract rates are based on the number of sites number of users organization size the client’s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis we recognize this revenue on a straightline basis over the life of the contract annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable prior to 2001 our contract renewal rate historically had exceeded 90 on an annual basis for the year ended december 31 2001 our renewal rate decreased to 83 as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions subsequent to 2001 our contract renewal rate has been increasing and for the year ended december 31 2003 our contract renewal rate was 88 we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives beginning in the first quarter of 2002 in accordance with financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately 42 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the previous year application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following  17 

   when we determine that the carrying value of longlived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment loss to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe the recovery is not reasonably assured we must establish a valuation allowance going forward we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance after we have determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets we may reverse the valuation allowance resulting in a benefit to the statement of operations in some future period accounting for employee stock options as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “apb no 25” “accounting for stock issued to employees” under apb no 25 we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date we disclose the required pro forma information in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 had been applied nongaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures in our public releases these nongaap financial measures include ebitda which is our net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and pro forma earnings which is our net income loss before purchase amortization in cost of revenues purchase amortization in operating expenses and the related income tax benefit we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission we disclose pro forma earnings in our earnings releases and investor conference calls the nongaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies also in the future we may disclose other nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations we view ebitda and pro forma earnings as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to them is net income loss in calculating ebitda and pro forma earnings we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the daytoday operation of our business we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these nongaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions ebitda and pro forma earnings are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as measures of liquidity as alternatives to net income loss or as indicators of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda and pro forma earnings as a substitute for any gaap financial measure including net income loss in addition we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual 18 

  reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda and pro forma earnings ebitda and pro forma earnings are used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business we have spent more than 16 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complimentary businesses due to the expansion of our information services which included acquisitions our net income loss includes significant charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization ebitda and pro forma earnings which exclude these charges provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business apart from charges for purchase amortization depreciation and other amortization we believe the disclosure of ebitda and pro forma earnings helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year we also believe ebitda and pro forma earnings are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges such as amortization and depreciation and nonoperating items such as interest and income taxes provides additional information about our cost structure and over time helps track our operating progress in addition investors securities analysts and others regularly rely on ebitda and pro forma earnings to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry finally management and the board of directors use pro forma earnings as one of several criteria to determine the achievement of performancebased cash bonuses set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and pro forma earnings and the material limitations associated with using these nongaap financial measures as compared to net income loss  management compensates for the abovedescribed limitations of using nongaap measures by only using nongaap measures to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 19 

  the following table shows our ebitda reconciled to our gaap net income loss and our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars  

consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  

comparison of year ended december 31 2003 and year ended december 31 2002   revenues revenues grew 198 from 794 million in 2002 to 951 million in 2003 this growth was the result of additional revenue from the property intelligence acquisition and further penetration of our subscriptionbased information services into our existing and potential customer base as well as the successful crossselling of information services into our existing customer base across our service platform revenues from our uk markets accounted for approximately 8 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 subscriptionbased information services consisting primarily of costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional and focus services currently generate over 90 of our total revenues 20 

    gross margin gross margin increased from 514 million in 2002 to 644 million in 2003 gross margin percentage also increased from 647 in 2002 to 677 in 2003 the increase in the gross margin percentage resulted principally from internal revenue growth from our subscriptionbased information services which was slightly offset by the addition of margins from our uk markets averaging approximately 60 cost of revenues increased from 280 million in 2002 to 307 million in 2003 principally due to the addition of cost of revenues from our uk markets as a result of the property intelligence acquisition which was slightly offset by a decrease in cost of revenues from our us markets   selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased from 232 million in 2002 to 265 million in 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 292 in 2002 to 279 in 2003 the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to the addition of approximately 14 million of selling and marketing expenses from our uk markets as a result of the property intelligence acquisition increased sales and marketing personnel costs and marketing campaigns surrounding the release of our webbased costar property professional service   software development expenses software development expenses increased from 55 million in 2002 to 69 million in 2003 and increased as a percentage of revenues from 70 in 2002 to 73 in 2003 this increase was due to the addition of uk software development expenses as a result of the property intelligence acquisition and our continued focus on service enhancements and development as well as the support of internal information systems to manage the company’s growth   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from 246 million in 2002 to 265 million in 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 310 in 2002 to 278 in 2003 the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the addition of 28 million for uk general and administrative expenses as a result of the property intelligence acquisition which was offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses from our us markets primarily due to reductions in administrative headcount   purchase amortization purchase amortization increased from 36 million in 2002 to 45 million in 2003 this increase was due to increased purchase price amortization of identified intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of property intelligence and was partially offset by a decrease in purchase amortization resulting from the complete amortization of certain identified intangible assets during 2003   other income net interest and other income decreased from 759000 in 2002 to 380000 in 2003 this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash balances for the first three quarters of 2003 and lower interest rates during the year   income tax expense income tax expense increased from 0 in 2002 to 282000 in 2003 this increase is a result of the fact that we achieved taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 which caused us to incur income tax expense our total income tax expense was partially offset through the use of some of our net operating loss carryforwards because we are subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and because certain state and local tax jurisdictions do not currently recognize portions of our net loss carryforwards we were not able to completely offset our income tax liability through the use of our net operating loss carryforwards comparison of year ended december 31 2002 and year ended december 31 2001   revenues revenues grew 94 from 725 million in 2001 to 794 million in 2002 this growth was principally the result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our national platform as well as the successful crossselling of services into our existing customer base subscription based information services including costar property professional costar tenant costar comps professional costar exchange and costar connect accounted for over 90 of the company’s revenues   gross margin gross margin increased from 422 million in 2001 to 514 million in 2002 gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased from 582 in 2001 to 647 in 2002 the increase in gross margin amount and percentage resulted from revenue growth combined with a reduction in cost of revenues this reduction was principally due to a 25 million decrease in purchase price amortization resulting from the complete amortization of 21 

  certain identified intangibles assets during the first quarter of 2002 this was somewhat offset by an increase in research personnel costs compared to the same period in 2001   selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased from 235 million in 2001 to 232 million in 2002 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 324 in 2001 to 292 in 2002 during 2002 we significantly increased the size of our sales force for subscriptionbased information services although this growth occurred selling and marketing expenses decreased during 2002 principally as a result of a reduction in overall operating costs associated with the sales organization including travel and other personnel costs   software development expenses software development expenses increased from 51 million in 2001 to 55 million in 2002 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 71 in 2001 to 70 in 2002 the increase in software development expenses reflects development costs for the increased number of services we now support in addition these costs reflect the support of internal information systems to manage the company’s growth   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from 284 million in 2001 to 246 million in 2002 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 392 in 2001 to 310 in 2002 the decrease in the amount of general and administrative expenses is primarily due to reductions in administrative headcount communications consulting travel costs and outside services during 2002   purchase amortization purchase amortization decreased from 78 million in 2001 to 36 million in 2002 purchase amortization decreased primarily due to the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” and no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under the new rules goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the standards the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately 42 million for 2002 as compared to 2001   other income net interest and other income decreased from 16 million in 2001 to 759000 in 2002 this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances and lower interest rates during the year   income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased from 987000 in 2001 to 0 in 2002 this decrease was a result of the reversal of the deferred tax liability incurred in connection with the amortization of identified intangible assets acquired through acquisitions consolidated quarterly results of operations the following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts  

   

recent acquisitions   realnet on september 19 2002 we acquired certain assets of portlandbased commercial real estate information provider realnet in a purchase business combination for 305000 in cash the purchase price was allocated primarily to acquired database technology and customer base the acquired database technology is being amortized on a straightline basis over 5 years the customer base which consists of one distinct intangible asset composed of acquired customer contracts and related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over a period of five years   property intelligence on january 6 2003 we acquired the share capital of londonbased property intelligence for the us dollar equivalent of approximately 174 million net of cash acquired of approximately 14 million the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting the purchase price was principally allocated to cash and other working capital accounts database technology customer base and goodwill the acquired database technology is being amortized on a straightline basis over 5 years the customer base which consists of one distinct intangible asset composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships is being amortized on a 125 declining balance method over 10 years goodwill will not be amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests we are in the process of obtaining additional information regarding the income tax attributes and deferred taxes related to property intelligence to complete the purchase price allocation property intelligence whose operations principally consist of focus services is a leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united kingdom liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 974 million at december 31 2003 compared to 271 million at december 31 2002 in addition we had 164 million of cash held for acquisition as of december 31 2002 which was used for the acquisition of property intelligence which closed on january 6 2003 from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 703 million principally as a result of our november 2003 followon public offering in which we issued 1667500 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of 535 million net cash provided by operating activities of 136 million and proceeds of 83 million from stock option exercises used to purchase approximately 395000 shares of common stock offset by cash purchases of property and equipment of approximately 39 million and the net outlay of cash for the property intelligence acquisition net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 136 million compared to 56 million for the year ended december 31 2002 this 80 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of revenue growth and resulting growth in gross margin which contributed to reaching 100000 of gaap net income in 2003 compared to a gaap net loss of 48 million in 2002 additionally improved account collections resulted in a reduction of approximately 23 million in accounts receivable contributing to operating cash flow 23 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 655 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 115 million for the year ended december 31 2002 this 540 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to the increase in purchases of shortterm investments from the proceeds of our november 2003 followon public offering and the net cash paid for the acquisition of property intelligence net cash provided by financing activities was 618 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 696000 for the year ended december 31 2002 this 611 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was principally the result of our november 2003 followon public offering in which we issued 1667500 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of 535 million as well as proceeds of 83 million from stock option exercises to purchase approximately 395000 shares of common stock   contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands  

 capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to include investments in assets required to support our planned market expansion including additional field research vehicles building photography initial databases and communications measuring photographic and computer equipment totaling approximately 55 million additionally approximately 35 million to 4 million is planned to support existing operations consistent with expenditures for the past several years to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we expect to use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months we achieved taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 which enabled us to utilize some of our net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes although our net operating loss carryforwards are substantial we are subject to limitations on their use in addition we are subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and state and local tax jurisdictions that currently do not recognize portions of these loss carryforwards as a result we incurred income tax expense of approximately 282000 during 2003 we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations recent accounting pronouncements effective january 1 2003 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas 146” sfas 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan sfas 146 replaces previous accounting guidance provided by emerging issues task force issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” and is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 adoption of this statement had no material impact on our consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or liquidity in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” “sfas 148” sfas 148 amends financial accounting 24

  risk factors   we have experienced operating losses and our future profitability is uncertain  until the third quarter of 2003 we had not recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new information services has caused our expenses to exceed our revenues our ability to continue to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to manage our growth including our expansion plans and to generate revenues that exceed our expenses in addition our ability to continue to earn a profit to increase revenues or to control costs could be affected by the factors set forth below we may not be able to generate revenues or control expenses sufficient to earn a profit to increase profits on a quarterly or annual basis or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth and as a result the market price of our common stock may decline   a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services  the commercial real estate industry has begun to stabilize in recent months as evidenced by improving leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates however a reversal of this trend or renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may continue to affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers both of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base which could decrease demand for our information services also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our information services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability   we may not be able to complete successfully our planned geographic expansion which may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  expanding into new markets imposes additional burdens on our research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources in 2004 we expect to expand into 21 new us markets and expand geographic coverage in certain of our existing markets if we are unable to manage this expansion plan our financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs to expand into these new markets or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets then it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues if we are unable to complete successfully our planned geographic expansion or if we are unable to manage this expansion successfully it may adversely affect our profitability   we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information services which could decrease our revenues and our profitability  our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information services developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services in addition successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new services it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues or our revenue growth rate and by reducing our profitability   general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues  our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including inflation interest rates perceived and actual economic conditions taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels the recent negative state of the economy and the commercial real estate industry in particular has had a negative impact on our business negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability additionally any war in which the united states is involved or any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses which may not be offset by increased revenues if 26 

  clients choose to cancel our information services as a result of economic conditions and we do not acquire new clients our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected   if we are not able to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses services databases and technologies and expect to continue to do so in the future our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks including managing the integration of personnel and products managing geographically remote operations such as property intelligence in the united kingdom the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets   our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our operating results  our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons many of which are outside of our control such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our services competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues changes or consolidation in the real estate industry the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements successful execution of our expansion plan the development of our sales force managerial execution data quality employee retention foreign currency fluctuations our investments in geographic expansion successful adoption of and training on the company’s services the timing of investing the net proceeds from our offerings acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client training and support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of gaap net income including without limitation changes requiring us to expense stock options fluctuations in our operating results revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline   our revenues and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients  our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information services our subscriptionbased information services generate the largest portion of our revenues however we may be unable to attract new clients in planned expansion markets and our clients existing markets may decide not to add not to renew or to cancel subscription services as a result of several factors including without limitation a decision that they have no need for our services a decision to use alternative services pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate industry data quality technical problems or economic or competitive pressures if clients decide not to renew or cancel their agreements and we do not attract new clients then our revenues or our revenue growth rate may decline   if our operating costs are higher than we expect our profitability may be reduced  many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses additionally we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs occupancy costs communications costs travel costs software development costs outside services costs and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected   competition could render our services uncompetitive  the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing our existing competitors or future competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able 27 

  to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability   international expansion may result in new business risks which may reduce our profitability  our international expansion could subject us to new business risks including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the united states currency exchange rate fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our growth successfully we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced finally the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition   fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition  as a result of the property intelligence acquisition a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and as a result fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition currencies may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we do not have any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully on acceptable terms or at all we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future and significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound may decrease the value of our foreign assets as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries   if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data we could experience reduced demand for our information services  our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging if our data including the data we obtain from third parties is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses   if we are unable to hire retain and continue to develop our sales force our revenues could be adversely affected  in order to support revenue growth we need to continue to develop train and retain our sales force our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to integrate and motivate sales personnel our ability to effectively train our sales force the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel and our ability to effectively manage a multilocation sales organization if we are unable to hire develop or retain the members of our sales force or if our sales force is unproductive our revenues could decline or cease to grow and our expenses could increase   temporary or permanent outages of our computers software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information services  our operations depend on our ability to protect our database computers and software telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire power loss security breaches computer viruses and telecommunications failures any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information services to clients we could experience reduced demand for our information services   technical problems that affect our customers’ use of or access to our services could lead to reduced demand for our information services  our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our web site the internet and our service providers problems with our web site the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers’ access to our information services if we experience technical problems in distributing our services we could experience reduced demand for our information services in addition 28 

  the software underlying our services is complex and may contain undetected errors despite testing we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in our software any errors could result in adverse publicity impaired use of our services loss of revenues cost increases and legal claims by customers all these factors could seriously damage our business operating results and financial condition   our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel including our president and chief executive officer andrew florance our officers and other key employees our business requires highly skilled technical sales management webdevelopment marketing and research personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers to retain and attract key personnel we use various measures including employment agreements a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr florance or other key officers or employees   litigation in which we become involved or newlyadopted laws and regulations may significantly increase our expenses  currently and from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient insurance to cover our pending claims or our future claims any lawsuits in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money if any claims are determined against us our profitability could be reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected in addition governments in the united states or abroad could adopt laws that could harm our business by for example regulating the information we provide or regulating our transmissions over the internet or exposing our business to taxes in various jurisdictions compliance with any such laws could increase our costs or make our services less attractive   if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property our business competitive position and operating results could be harmed  the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies database services and software we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and other laws nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights however current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and evolving and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons’ intellectual property rights any intellectual property lawsuits in which we are involved either as a plaintiff or as a defendant could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management’s attention from operating our business in addition if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims this could result in a change to our methodology or information services and could reduce our profitability   we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information  because the content in our database is distributed to others we may be subject to claims for defamation negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or information on our web site supplied by third parties even if these claims do not result in liability to us we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information services to users   market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price  the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors including quartertoquarter variations in our operating results changes in analysts’ estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights regulatory developments and economic or other factors in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other technology companies in particular have experienced 29 

  extreme price fluctuations this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies

 item 1 business  in this report the words “we” “our” “us” “costar” or the “company” refer to costar group inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries this report also refers to our web sites but information contained on those sites is not part of this report costar group inc is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and united kingdom costar’s integrated suite of products offers customers online access to the most comprehensive verified database of commercial real estate information on 50 us markets as well as london and

over 50 proprietary databases industry overview the market for commercial real estate information is vast based on the variety volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions industry participants must have extensive accurate and current information members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability rental rates vacancy rates tenant movements sales comparables supply new construction absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively there is a strong need for an efficient marketplace where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interact with each other on a continuous basis a large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community require extensive information to conduct their businesses including  1   the commercial real estate and related business community generally operates in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace various organizations including hundreds of brokerage firms directory publishers and local research companies have attempted to collect data on specific markets and develop software to analyze the information they have independently gathered this highly fragmented methodology has resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information excessive internal cost and the creation of nonstandardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness resulting in a formidable information gap the creation of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires an infrastructure including a standardized database accurate and comprehensive research capabilities easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction by combining its extensive database over 500 experienced researchers technological expertise and broad customer base costar believes that it has created such a platform costar’s comprehensive database costar has spent more than 15 years building and acquiring a

employed over 500 commercial real estate research professionals our research professionals undergo an extensive training program to maintain consistent research methods and processes our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls emails internet updates and faxes each year in addition to field inspections public records review news monitoring and direct mail each researcher is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the database as part of their update process researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers 2   costar has an extensive field research effort that permits physical inspection of properties in order to find additional inventory photograph properties and verify existing information some of these researchers use costar trucks equipped with global positioning systems which use satellites to keep track of the truck’s location and pinpoint building locations each costar truck uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data a dispatch center in the company’s bethesda office manages the entire daytoday us field operations while using tracking software to monitor each researcher’s progress as of march 1 2003 costar had 41 trucks used by field researchers in markets throughout the united states a typical site inspection consists of photographing the building measuring the building if necessary capturing “for lease” sign information counting parking spaces assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information certain researchers canvass properties interviewing tenants suite by suite other researchers conduct fieldwork in county courthouses and public records offices in addition many of our field researchers are photographers who take photographs of commercial real estate properties to add to the collection of costar’s digital images in our database   data providers we license a portion of our data from public record providers and thirdparty data sources licensing agreements with these entities provide for our use of a variety of commercial real estate information including property ownership tenant information maps and aerial photographs all of which enhances various costar

beginning of 2001 we had substantially completed our goal of establishing a national platform of operating regions and service offerings in 50 us market areas from which we believe we can appropriately meet the commercial real estate community’s needs for comprehensive us buildingspecific information during 2001 and 2002 we focused on continuing to grow revenue while controlling and reducing costs in order to reduce operating losses and ultimately move our business to profitability on an ongoing basis we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow revenue from our existing platform and services is significant and that a large component of the operating cost structure of the company is made up of fixed operating costs during 2002 the company increased pro forma net income which represents our net loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” after excluding purchase amortization in cost of revenues purchase amortization in operating expenses and the related income tax benefit by 96 million from a pro forma net loss of 79 million in 2001 to pro forma net income of 17 million in 2002 in addition the company increased ebitda by 98 million from negative ebitda of 36 million in 2001 to positive ebitda of 62 million in 2002 also the company’s gaap net loss decreased from 202 million in 2001 to 48 million in 2002 our use of nongaap financial measures is discussed later in this section these 2002 results do not include the property intelligence acquisition which was completed on january 6 2003 by combining property intelligence’s operations with costar’s operations and our expected organic growth costar expects 2003 revenue to grow significantly over 2002 revenue in addition we expect 2003 pro forma net income to significantly increase over 2002 pro forma net income we also expect to achieve gaapbasis earnings by the end of 2003 if the company achieves gaapbasis earnings the company’s diluted net income per share may be lower than its basic net income per share if any of the company’s outstanding stock options have an exercise price lower than the average market price of our common stock for any period in which we report gaap net income with the achievement of the expected results we believe we can maintain positive cash flow from operations throughout 2003 in addition we expect to achieve tax basis earnings in 2003 which may result in us utilizing some of our net operating loss carryforwards to the extent we are not able to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards we may incur an income tax expense during 2003 we continue to develop and distribute new services and expand existing services across our current regions the incremental cost of introducing new services and expanding existing services in the future may reduce the profitability of a region or cause it to incur losses in addition we may continue our geographic expansion in the united states or we may seek additional international geographic expansion therefore while we expect current service offerings in existing regions to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate additional losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future while our services continue to expand our costar property costar tenant and costar comps services currently generate the largest portion of our revenue the costar property costar tenant and costar comps subscription contracts generally have terms of one to three years and renew automatically upon renewal many of the contract rates increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations to encourage clients to use our services regularly we generally charge fixed amounts rather than fees based on actual system usage we charge our clients based on the number of sites organization size the client’s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes prior to 2001 our contract renewal rate historically had exceeded 90 on an annual basis for the year ended december 31 2001 our renewal rate decreased to 83 as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions together with cancellations by many telecommunications companies however for the year ended december 31 2002 our contract renewal rate increased to 87 over 90 of our revenues arise from clients under subscription contracts our subscription clients pay contract fees on an annual quarterly or monthly basis we recognize this revenue over the life of the contract on a straightline basis beginning with the installation or renewal date annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives beginning in the first quarter of 2002 in accordance with financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives during the second quarter of 2002 we completed the initial impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets which did not indicate an impairment loss the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately 42 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the previous year 13   application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of longlived assets identifiable intangibles and goodwill through our annual impairment tests or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following  when we determine that the carrying value may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe the recovery is not reasonably assured we must establish a valuation allowance going forward we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance after we have determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets we may reverse the valuation allowance resulting in a benefit to the statement of operations in some future period accounting for employee stock options as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “apb no 25” “accounting for stock issued to employees” under apb no 25 we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date we disclose the required pro forma information in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 had been applied 14   nongaap financial measures we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain nongaap financial measures included in quarterly earnings releases investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission these nongaap financial measures include pro forma net income which we have determined by excluding purchase amortization in cost of revenues purchase amortization in operating expenses acquired inprocess development and the related income tax benefit from our gaap net loss and ebitda which is our income from continuing operations before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization we believe the disclosure of pro forma net income and ebitda helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our ongoing operations from quarter to quarter and from year to year because it more clearly indicates our ongoing operating results particularly as they relate to our operating cash flows management also uses these numbers to internally measure its operating and management performance and uses pro forma net income as one of several criteria to determine the achievement of performancebased cash bonuses however we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q and our annual reports on form 10k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with our pro forma net income and ebitda in the future we may disclose other nongaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations the following table shows our pro forma net income and our ebitda reconciled to our gaap net loss for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars  consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  15   comparison of year ended december 31 2002 and year ended december 31 2001   revenues revenues grew 94 from 725 million in 2001 to 794 million in 2002 this growth was principally the result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our national platform as well as the successful crossselling of services into our existing customer base subscription based information products including costar property costar tenant costar comps costar exchange and costar connect continue to account for over 90 of the company’s revenues   gross margin gross margin increased from 422 million in 2001 to 514 million in 2002 gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased from 582 in 2001 to 647 in 2002 the increase in gross margin amount and percentage resulted from revenue growth combined with a reduction in cost of revenues this reduction was principally due to a 25 million decrease in purchase price amortization resulting from the complete amortization of certain identified intangibles assets during the first quarter of 2002 this was somewhat offset by an increase in research personnel costs compared to the same period in 2001   selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased from 235 million in 2001 to 232 million in 2002 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 324 in 2001 to 292 in 2002 during 2002 we significantly increased the size of our sales force for subscription based information products although this growth occurred selling and marketing expenses decreased during 2002 principally as a result of a reduction in overall operating costs associated with the sales organization including travel and other personnel costs   software development expenses software development expenses increased from 51 million in 2001 to 55 million in 2002 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 71 in 2001 to 70 in 2002 the increase in software development expenses reflects development costs for the increased number of products we now support in addition these costs reflect the support of internal information systems to manage the company’s growth   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from 284 million in 2001 to 246 million in 2002 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 392 in 2001 to 310 in 2002 the decrease in the amount of general and administrative expenses is primarily due to reductions in administrative headcount communications consulting travel costs and outside services during 2002   purchase amortization purchase amortization decreased from 78 million in 2001 to 36 million in 2002 purchase amortization decreased primarily due to the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” and no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under the new rules goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the standards the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately 42 million for 2002 as compared to 2001   other income net interest and other income decreased from 16 million in 2001 to 759000 in 2002 this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances and lower interest rates during the year   income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased from 987000 in 2001 to 0 in 2002 this decrease was a result of the reversal of the deferred tax liability incurred in connection with the amortization of identified intangible assets acquired through acquisitions comparison of year ended december 31 2001 and year ended december 31 2000   revenues revenues grew 239 from 585 million in 2000 to 725 million in 2001 this increase resulted principally from the further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our national platform as well as the successful cross selling of products into our existing customer base revenue from comps acquired in february of 2000 grew from 155 million in 2000 to 197 million in 2001 increases in revenue achieved in all major service areas were partially offset by a reduction in costar marketplace electronic advertising revenue which declined from 19 million in 2000 to 13 million in 2001 16     gross margin gross margin increased from 283 million in 2000 to 422 million in 2001 gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased from 484 in 2000 to 582 in 2001 the increase in gross margin amount and percentage resulted from revenue growth combined with the impact of a relatively fixed cost structure for research as a result of the fixed cost structure cost of revenues was relatively unchanged from 2000 to 2001 purchase price amortization included in cost of revenues increased from 48 million in 2000 to 54 million in 2001   selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased from 376 million in 2000 to 235 million in 2001 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 643 in 2000 to 324 in 2001 selling and marketing expenses decreased during 2001 as a result of a substantial reduction in advertising and marketing activities and a reduction in operating costs associated with the sales organization including communications travel recruiting and personnel costs particularly in the area of electronic advertising   software development expenses software development expenses increased from 39 million in 2000 to 51 million in 2001 and increased as a percentage of revenues from 66 in 2000 to 71 in 2001 the increase in software development expenses reflects development costs for the increased number of products we now support including costar comps costar exchange and costar connect and the increase in support of internal systems to manage the company’s growth   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from 271 million in 2000 to 284 million in 2001 but decreased as a percentage of revenues from 463 in 2000 to 392 in 2001 the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased operational expenses associated with the company’s expanded operations including office rent expense and increased depreciation of property and equipment offset partially by a decrease in outside services expenses   purchase amortization purchase amortization decreased from 89 million in 2000 to 78 million in 2001 this reduction resulted from a decrease in amortization of certain intangible assets arising as part of the comps acquisition   acquired inprocess development acquired inprocess development costs of 58 million in 2000 consist of inprocess development costs written off as part of the comps acquisition   other income net interest and other income decreased from 33 million in 2000 to 16 million in 2001 this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances and lower interest rates during the year   income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased from 20 million in 2000 to 987000 in 2001 this decrease was a result of the reversal of the deferred tax liability incurred in connection with the amortization of identified intangible assets acquired through acquisitions consolidated quarterly results of operations the following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods in thousands except per share amounts  17    recent acquisitions   comps on february 10 2000 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of comps a san diego based provider of commercial real estate information for 490 million in cash and 2259034 shares of the company’s common stock the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been valued at approximately 1014 million for accounting purposes the purchase price was allocated primarily to cash of 466 million and acquired database technology and other intangibles which are being amortized over a period of 2 to 10 years in connection with the purchase of comps 58 million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased inprocess development and expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no future alternative use existed the acquired inprocess development was analyzed through an independent thirdparty valuation using the expected cash flow approach   first image technologies on november 9 2000 we completed the acquisition of first image the owner of the metropolis software system a single interface that combines commercial real estate data from multiple information providers we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of first image for approximately 665000 in cash and 9424 shares of our common stock the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the initial consideration was valued for accounting purposes at approximately 950000 including acquisition expenses in addition the acquisition agreement provided for approximately 950000 of additional consideration in a combination of cash and stock to be paid by costar upon the achievement of certain operating goals by the sole stockholder of first image on june 7 2002 in consideration of the achievement of one of the operating goals we issued additional consideration valued at approximately 432000 consisting of a cash payment of approximately 333000 and 4712 shares of common stock under the agreement the sole shareholder has the opportunity to receive additional consideration upon the achievement of the second of the operating goals   realnet on september 19 2002 we acquired certain assets of portlandbased commercial real estate information provider realnet in a purchase business combination for 305000 in cash the purchase price was allocated primarily to acquired database technology and customer base which will be amortized over a period of five years   property intelligence plc on january 6 2003 we acquired the share capital of londonbased property intelligence for the us dollar equivalent of approximately 164 million in cash paid to the owners of the share capital and approximately 400000 in cash net of exercise proceeds paid to the option holders of property intelligence who simultaneously exercised their options with the closing of the acquisition the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting the purchase price was principally allocated to cash and other working capital accounts database technology customer base and goodwill the acquired database technology and customer base will be amortized over their estimated useful lives goodwill will not be amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests property intelligence whose operations principally consist of focus information is a leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united kingdom 18   liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments total cash and cash equivalents cash held for acquisition and shortterm investments were 435 million at december 31 2002 an increase of 15 million from 420 million at december 31 2001 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 255 million and 307 million and our short term investments balance was 16 million and 113 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively at december 31 2002 we had 164 million of cash allocated for the acquisition of londonbased property intelligence which was paid out in conjunction with the closing of this acquisition on january 6 2003 the increase in cash and cash equivalents cash held for acquisition and shortterm investments in 2002 over 2001 was due principally to cash provided from operating activities and the exercise of stock options offset by 40 million in purchases of property and equipment a cash payment of 333000 paid in connection with the completion of one of the earnout provisions relating to the acquisition of first image and a cash payment of 305000 in consideration for the acquisition of certain of the assets of realnet net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 56 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of 45 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this 101 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of revenue growth and reductions in operating expenses both of which contributed to a reduction of our net loss for 2002 compared to 2001 net cash used in investing activities was 115 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 103 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2002 was principally due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment we have entered into numerous operating leases for office space throughout the country including our headquarters and as of december 31 2002 had annual commitments for total rent payments ranging from 52 million to 450000 over the next eight years during the third and fourth quarters of 2002 we completed our planned relocation of our san diego office and incurred capital expenditures of approximately 15 million to date we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations we expect to use cash stock debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions based on current plans we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months although we have experienced net losses to date we expect to achieve tax basis earnings in 2003 once we have determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of our deferred tax assets we expect to offset any income tax liability related to our tax basis earnings with our net operating loss carryforwards in future periods to the extent we are not able to offset our taxable income by the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards we would incur an income tax charge to our consolidated statement of operations we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations recent accounting pronouncements in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes emerging issues task force issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas no 146 requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan and also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the costs we are required to adopt sfas no 146 for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 146 to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 19   in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” this statement which is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 amends sfas no 123 and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 regardless of the accounting method used to account for stockbased compensation we have chosen to continue to account for stockbased compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 25 and related interpretations the enhanced disclosure provisions as defined by sfas no 148 are effective now for our year ended december 31 2002 cautionary statement

to release publicly any revisions to these forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events risk factors   our future profitability is uncertain to date we have not recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new services has caused our expenses to exceed our profits our ability to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to manage our growth and to generate revenues that exceed our expenses in addition our ability to earn a profit to increase revenues or to control costs could be affected by the factors set forth below we may not be able to generate revenues or control expenses sufficient to earn a profit to maintain profits on a quarterly or annual basis or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth 20     our operating results may fluctuate significantly our operating results revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons such as cancellations or nonrenewals of our products competition our ability to control expenses loss of clients or revenues changes or consolidation in the real estate industry the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements the development of our sales force managerial execution data quality employee retention foreign currency fluctuations our investments in geographic expansion successful adoption of and training on the company’s products the timing of investing the net proceeds from our offerings acquisitions of other companies or assets sales brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities client training and support activities changes in client budgets or our investments in other corporate resources in addition changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our results of operations including without limitation changes requiring us to expense stock options   we may not be able to attract and retain clients our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our services the costar property costar tenant and costar comps subscription contracts which generate the largest portion of our revenue generally range from terms of one to three years our clients may decide not to renew or to cancel their agreements as a result of several factors including a decision that they have no need for our products a decision to use alternative products pricing and budgetary constraints consolidation in the real estate industry data quality technical problems or economic or competitive pressures in addition if we do not maintain adequate training and support levels we could experience reduced demand for our services if clients decide not to renew or cancel their agreements and we do not attract new clients then our revenues will be adversely affected   our operating costs may be higher than we expect many of our expenses particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs are relatively fixed as a result we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses additionally we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion acquisition costs occupancy costs communications costs travel costs software development costs outside services costs and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected   competition could render our services uncompetitive the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing our existing competitors or potential new competitors may have greater name recognition larger customer bases better technology or data lower prices easier access to data greater user traffic or greater financial technical or marketing resources than we have our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns obtain more data adopt more aggressive pricing policies make more attractive offers to potential employees subscribers distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses which would reduce our profitability   continued downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may have an adverse effect on our business currently the commercial real estate industry is in a weakened state as evidenced by higher vacancy rates and lower leasing activity rental rates and absorption rates a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base and adversely affects our business a continuation of the weak commercial real estate business may continue to affect our ability to generate new sales and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers both of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations also companies in this industry are consolidating often in order to reduce expenses consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our services by our customers reduce the number of our existing clients reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients’ bargaining power all of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations   general economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global national regional and local economic conditions including inflation interest rates perceived and actual economic conditions taxation policies availability of credit employment levels and wage and salary levels the current negative state of the economy and the commercial real estate industry in particular has had a negative impact on our business any continuation of these negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business additionally any war in which the united states is involved or any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could affect our financial performance and our stock price in addition a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses which may not be offset by increased revenues if clients choose to cancel our services as a result of economic conditions and we do not acquire new clients our financial position would be adversely affected 21     international expansion may result in new business risks our international expansion could subject us to new business risks including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign commercial real estate markets difficulties in managing foreign operations limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods costs of enforcing contractual obligations impact of recessions in economies outside the united states currency exchange rate fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences in addition international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel systems development research and sales departments and general managerial resources if we are not able to manage our expanded growth successfully it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability finally the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion which could adversely affect our financial condition   fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition as a result of the property intelligence acquisition a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and as such fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition this currency may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries all of which can have an adverse impact on a country’s currency currently we do not have any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully or at all we cannot predict whether foreign exchange losses will be incurred in the future and significant foreign exchange fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   we may not be able to successfully introduce new products or upgraded products our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new products and upgraded products into the marketplace to be successful we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our products and services developing new products and upgrades to products imposes heavy burdens on our systems development department product managers management and researchers this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services and products in addition successfully launching and selling a new product such as webbased costar property 80 puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources if we are unable to develop new products or upgrades to our products then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our business may be adversely affected in addition if we incur significant costs in developing new products or upgrades to our products are not successful in marketing and selling these new products or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new products it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate comprehensive or reliable data our business could be harmed our success depends on our clients’ confidence in the comprehensiveness accuracy and reliability of the data we provide the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging if our data is not current accurate comprehensive or reliable we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses in addition we license some of our data images and technology from public records providers and other

estimates of our earnings announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services general conditions in the commercial real estate industry developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights regulatory developments and economic or other factors in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the shares of internetrelated and other
