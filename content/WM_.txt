operations

general

in 2021 our senior management began evaluating overseeing and managing the financial performance of our solid waste operations through two operating segments our east tier primarily consists of geographic areas located in the eastern us the great lakes region and substantially all of canada our west tier primarily includes geographic areas located in the western us including the upper midwest region and british columbia canada each of our solid waste operating segments provides integrated environmental services including collection transfer recycling and disposal the company finalized the assessment of our segments during the fourth quarter of 2021 the east and west tiers are presented in this report and constitute our existing solid waste business on october 30 2020 we acquired advanced disposal services inc “advanced disposal” the operations of which are presented in this report within our existing solid waste tiers additional information related to our acquisition of advanced disposal and segments is included in notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements respectively we also provide expanded service offerings and solutions that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” the services we provide are described below

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements



 

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america as of december 31 2021 we owned or operated 255 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills throughout the us and canada solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and thus thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including our cost to construct maintain and close the landfill the distance to an alternative disposal facility the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited and competition

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers

transfer as of december 31 2021 we owned or operated 340 transfer stations in the us and canada we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage we were the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix clean bottles cans paper and cardboard in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling volumes singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies in 2021 we made significant investments in technology to automate our equipment which benefits our labor productivity produce higher quality commodities for our customers and increase our capacity in geographies where we currently have a mrf as well as expanding our footprint into new geographies in addition to advancing our single stream recycling programs for commercial applications we will continue to invest in recycling technologies designed to offer services and solutions to support and grow our current operations recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following

materials processing — through our collection operations and thirdparty customer base we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing as of december 31 2021 we operated 96 mrfs of which 49 are single stream where cardboard paper glass metals plastics construction and demolition materials and other recycling commodities are recovered for resale or redirected for other purposes

recycling commodities — we market and resell recycling commodities globally we manage the marketing of recycling commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality

recycling brokerage services  — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recycling commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recycling commodities with minimal capital requirements

the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are received from various sources including third parties and our own operations in recent years we have been focused on reducing dependency on market prices for recycled commodities by recovering our processing costs first in our materials processing business we have been transitioning our customer base over time from the traditional rebate model where we paid suppliers for the inbound material to a feeforservice model that ensures the cost of processing the recyclable materials is covered along with an acceptable margin with our current feeforservice model the pricing for these recyclable materials can either be a charge or “tip fee” when commodity pricing does not cover our cost to process the recyclable materials or a “rebate” when commodity pricing is higher than our processing costs and we are able to share this benefit with the customers generating recyclable materials in some cases our pricing is based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates generally this pricing also considers the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the pricing to our suppliers depending on the key terms of the arrangement these “rebates” are recorded as either operating expenses or a reduction in operating revenues within our consolidated statements of operations if the key terms result in a charge to the customer the associated “tip fees” would be recorded as operating revenues within our consolidated statements of operations

other other services we provide include the following

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic business solutions “wmsbs” business works with customers whose locations span the us and canada our strategic accounts 

program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ waste management needs across multiple locations

our energy and environmental services “ees” business offers our customers a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash which is residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our ees business but reflected principally in our collection line of business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection line of business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy business landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the us environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources as of december 31 2021 we had 144 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills for 102 of these projects the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 16 of these projects the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers for 26 of these projects the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes

wm renewable energy also produces renewable natural gas “rng” from landfill gas and generates renewable identification numbers “rins” under the renewable fuel standard “rfs” program and other credits under a variety of state programs associated with the use of rng in our compressed natural gas fleet the rins and credits are sold to counterparties who are obligated under the regulatory programs and have a responsibility to procure rins and credits proportionate to their fossil fuel production and imports rins prices generally respond to regulations enacted by the epa or other regulatory bodies as well as fluctuations in supply and demand wm renewable energy currently has four owned facilities producing 32 million mmbtu of rng annually and most of the revenue from these facilities is generated through the sale of rins we expect to grow the number of plants from four to 21 by 2026 and project that we will generate approximately 24 million mmbtu of rng annually with the expanded asset base while developing these facilities and expanding our renewable energy generation we intend to evaluate various offtake arrangements including the sale of rins and the direct sale of rng to large industrial users such as utilities and colleges and universities

we provide expanded service offerings and solutions that are not managed through our solid waste business including the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® business

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations while most of these investments are in the form of minority equity stakes they can also include joint ventures joint development agreements or majority equity stakes the solutions and services include i waste collection processing and recycling ii the development operation and marketing of waste processing facilities and technologies iii operation of renewable natural gas plants and iv the development and operation of organic recycling technologies furthermore we continually scout evaluate and run proofofconcepts of innovative technologies within our core operations to improve safety operational efficiencies and customer solutions

competition

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we also compete for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs

seasonal trends

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results of the geographic areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the geographic areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events while weatherrelated and other eventdriven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time due to significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins

human capital resources

employees

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 48500 fulltime employees across the us canada and india approximately 45400 employees were located within the us and 3100 employees were located outside of the us approximately 9200 employees were employed in administrative and sales positions with the remainder in operations approximately 8500 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements additional information about our workforce can be found in our 2021 sustainability report at httpssustainabilitywmcom our 2021 sustainability report does not constitute a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report we file with or furnish to the sec whether made before or after the date of this annual report on form 10k

inclusion equity and diversity

we embrace and cultivate respect trust open communications and diversity of thought and people we are committed to equality for all and foster an environment where all teammates feel welcomed valued and seen we are laserfocused on strengthening our current business strategy to see that inclusion equity and diversity “ied” are not an initiative but core in everything that we do our commitment to ied starts at the top with our senior leadership team being comprised of 30 ethnic minorities and 30 women as of december 31 2021 and with our overall workforce in the us being comprised of approximately 45 ethnic minorities and approximately 19 women as of the same date we are proud of what we have been able to achieve to enable us to achieve our goals we have established a crossfunctional ied council aimed at evaluating policies practices and procedures recruitment and partnerships to ensure that our ied efforts are sustainable and are tied to our business strategy 

compensation and benefits 

the objective of our compensation and benefit programs is to attract engage reward and incentivize valuable employees who will support the successful execution of our strategy we pay the full cost to provide employees with shortterm disability benefits longterm disability benefits basic life insurance for the employee and their dependents and employee and family assistance benefits the costs for medical and dental coverage are shared with employees with the company paying for a majority of the premium expense the company offers other important benefits such as paid vacation and holidays legal services flexible spending accounts dependent care assistance adoption assistance employee discounts and student loan refinancing services we also recognize the value of learning beyond the workplace in 2021 we announced a new education benefit your tomorrow your tomorrow was created in partnership with guild education 

to pay 100 of benefitseligible employees’ and dependents’ tuition for a broad range of fouryear college degree programs as well as programs such as highschool equivalency and for employees other certificate programs and graduate degrees we also provide plans to help employees save for their future refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our employee benefit plans 

financial assurance and insurance obligations

financial assurance

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting certain variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii a whollyowned insurance captive the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility “35 billion revolving credit facility” and other credit lines established for that purpose

insurance

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including health and welfare general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation real and personal property directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability cyber incident liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy we use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs as of december 31 2021 both our commercial general liability insurance policy and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2021 our automobile liability insurance program included a perincident deductible of up to 10 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2021 are summarized in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements

regulation

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the us and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in cases of violations

because the primary mission of our business is to collect process and manage solid waste and recyclables in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting construction operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations with acquisition development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility materials recovery facility compost facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there are no assurances that we 

will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing authority compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage

the regulatory environment in which we operate is influenced by changes in leadership at the federal state provincial and local levels the current us administration for example has been taking steps towards reinstating and in some cases enhancing policies and regulations rolled back by the previous administration while increasing regulation may have a negative impact on our operating costs extensive environmental regulation applicable to the waste sector is also a barrier to rapid entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve

federal regulation 

the primary us federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below

 

we continue to monitor certain developments under rcra including relief from increased user fees accompanying the system that the epa uses to track hazardous waste shipments electronically potential changes to the rules governing the disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion residuals and clarity on the us department of energy’s progress in establishing a government facility and corresponding fee structure for the longterm storage and disposal of elemental mercury we cannot predict what costs we will incur in connection with these regulations but we do not anticipate a material impact to our operations we also are working closely with both agencies to minimize risks to our industry on these regulatory matters



 

the epa finalized a rule in may 2021 implementing landfill gas control and monitoring requirements for older landfills however the regulatory changes contemplated therein are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole we also are closely monitoring the evolving capabilities of ground aerial and satellitebased methane detection and monitoring systems and investing in pilot programs to further explore these innovations as these technologies are expected to advance rapidly in the coming years we are continuing to engage with the epa on the implications of the changing landscape for the waste industry and potential future regulation

 

osha has recently indicated that it will pursue covid19 vaccine and testing requirements through a traditional rulemaking process and additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate we cannot currently predict the impact of any such vaccine requirements on our workforce

state provincial and local regulations

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations and laws governing where recyclable materials can be sold some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements

our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of materials at landfills such as recyclable materials cardboard bottles and cans yard waste food waste and electronics the number of state and local governments with recycling and diversion requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of recycling or processing many of these items remain challenging

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the us 

congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites which has been upheld by the us supreme court for waste directed to facilities owned by the local government the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however federal state provincial and local governments could take and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations for packaging including traditional recyclables such as cardboard bottles and cans if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations while fitness laws can present potential increased costs and barriers to entry into market areas these laws have not and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole

emerging trends in policy and regulation 

climate and sustainability 

jurisdictions are increasingly taking action to reduce greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions through a broad range of climate policies as landfills are emerging as one of the focal points for advancing climaterelated goals we are actively working with policymakers to ensure they recognize the significant reductions in ghg emissions that the waste sector already has achieved and the work being done to further reduce emissions the challenges associated with quantifying landfill emissions precisely and the role of our sector in providing an essential and highly regulated public service

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified strategic business opportunities to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling composting and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle assessment tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity 

we continue to assess the physical risks to our company’s operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events

consistent with our company’s longstanding commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship we have published our 2021 sustainability report which details the ghg emissions reductions we have facilitated to date and our determination to expand these reductions in the future as well as our commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe resilient and sustainable our 2021 sustainability report can be found at httpssustainabilitywmcom but it does not constitute a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k the company actively participates in a number of sustainability reporting programs and frameworks including being listed on the 2021 dow jones sustainability index world and north america indices 

pfas 

efforts to address sites contaminated with per and polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas” have drawn increased attention by the federal government and in the states pfas are a large group of chemicals that have been used in industrial and consumer products since the 1940s including in products as diverse as carpets paints and stains waterresistant clothing and fabrics nonstick cookware food packaging and firefighting chemicals possible human health effects of exposure to certain pfas compounds may include low infant birth weights immune system impacts or cancer in october 2021 the epa released its pfas strategic roadmap providing a highlevel overview of activities that the agency intends to take through 2024 to address pfas contamination these actions include establishing drinking water standards expanded authority for pfas remediation research and data collection on landfill discharges of pfas in leachate new risk assessments and test procedures and updated guidance on pfas disposal and destruction options meanwhile an increasing number of states have enacted new drinking water surface water andor groundwater limits for various pfas which has led to a patchwork of pfas standards across the us compliance with new and proposed pfas standards is anticipated to result in additional expense to the company but such standards are also anticipated to present potential business opportunities in the area of pfas management treatment and disposal

recycling foreign import and export regulations and material restrictions

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export recyclables attention on waste in the environment has led to new international laws restricting the flow of certain recyclables as an example on january 1 2021 new restrictions on the international trade of most plastics went into effect as part of the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal at this time the us is not a party to the basel convention but most countries to which we export commodities are which may limit our ability to export certain plastics 

in recent years changes in regulations affecting the international flow of recyclables have led to a reduction in export activity for recyclables higher quality requirements and higher processing costs covid19 placed additional financial stress on recyclers and municipalities resulting in some recycling programs being paused or eliminated these changes have led to a number of states considering epr regulations

prices and demand for recyclables fluctuate recycling revenue increased 537 million and 75 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively as compared with the prior year periods primarily from higher market prices for recycling commodities to support recent increases in both quality requirements and demand for commodities we have increased our investment in recycling infrastructure and the size of our recycling operations this in turn increases our exposure to commodity price fluctuations additionally future regulation tariffs international trade policies or other initiatives may impact supply and demand of material or increase operating costs which could impact the profitability of our recycling operations

for the past several years we have been working with stakeholders to educate the public on the need to recycle properly we continue to invest time and effort in working closely with customers to improve the quality of materials received at our facilities we have continued our focus on developing a sustainable recycling business model that meets 

customers’ environmental needs by passing through the increasing cost of processing and higher contamination rates and these efforts continued to have a positive impact on the operating results for our recycling business in 2021

with a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities and states across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use the most common materials banned include plastic bags and straws polystyrene plastic and some types of single use packaging these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling and composting programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials however with no viable end markets for many of these materials we and other recyclers are working to educate and remind customers of the need for end market demand and economic viability to support sustainable recycling programs with increased focus on responsible management of plastics our procurement team has taken a proactive approach to ensure environmental sustainability goals are prioritized in managing the products we buy

regulation of oil and gas exploration production and disposal

our ees business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and these disposal services include use of underground injection wells there is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals there also remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production including ghg emissions or hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costprohibitive for our ees customers to continue operations adversely affecting our business

additionally any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations including through use of injection wells could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services conversely any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely affect our business as we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services

investment in natural gas vehicles and infrastructure

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in the us and canada as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles additional regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business

there is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavyduty truck industry and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology such as electric powered vehicles rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles this is resulting in a reduction in tax incentives and grants for natural gas trucks although current options for heavyduty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations we are proactively engaging in pilots of electric powered heavyduty vehicles and anticipate that we could redirect future planned capital investments in our fleet toward these assets when the vehicles prove economically and operationally viable should regulation mandate an accelerated transition to electric powered vehicles our cost to acquire vehicles needed to service our customers could increase capital investment required to establish sufficient charging infrastructure could be significant and investments we have made in an industryleading natural gas fleet and infrastructure could be impaired

renewable fuel production

we have invested and continue to invest in facilities to capture methane produced from the company’s landfills and convert it into rng rng produced from our landfills as well as dairy biogas constitute a significant source of fuel for our natural gas collection vehicles the energy policy act of 2005 and energy independence and security act of 2007 authorized the rfs program that promotes the production and use of renewable transportation fuels many of our facilities are the eparegistered producers of transportation fuel making compressed and liquefied rng from landfill biogas which qualifies as a cellulosic biofuel under the rfs program oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of various categories of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as rins from renewable fuel producers market uncertainty related to the epa’s implementation of the rfs program led to volatility and declines in the price of rins between 2017 and 2020 rin prices rebounded in 2020 in response to a court ruling limiting the number of small refinery exemptions that the epa could grant to renewable fuel obligations and later following the november 2020 federal elections on the belief that the newly elected presidential administration would result in stronger enforcement of mandates for rng and other advanced and conventional biofuels the market’s expectations were realized in december 2021 when the epa proposed robust volumetric standards under the rfs program while proposing to deny all pending applications for small refinery exemptions the epa is expected to propose a rule later in 2022 setting forth the direction of the rfs program for 2023 and years after which rule is expected to afford additional opportunities for the biogas sector to participate in the rfs program we will continue to advocate for the current administration to implement policies that ensure long term stability for renewable transportation fuels as changes in the rfs market or the structure of the rfs program can and has impacted the financial performance of the facilities constructed to capture and treat the gas 

environmental justice 

federal state and local governments are also increasingly adopting requirements for environmental justice reviews as part of certain permitting decisions these policies generally require permitting agencies to give heightened attention to the potential for projects to disproportionately impact lowincome and minority communities our company supports policies seeking to advance high standards of environmental performance and the fair treatment of people of all races cultures and incomes nevertheless we are actively monitoring recent regulatory developments in this area as additional conditions imposed on permitting decisions could increase the time and cost involved to pursue and maintain necessary permits

 item 1a risk factors 

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements regarding

 

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2022 and beyond and could cause actual results to be materially different from those set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company in addition to the following risks there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known or are not currently believed to be material the company continues to be optimistic about volume recovery and overall economic recovery from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic however uncertainty remains with respect to various factors that influence the pace of economic recovery including the risks discussed below and the potential for future resurgence in transmission of covid19 and related business closures due to virus variants or otherwise such conditions could have an unanticipated adverse impact on our business we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of future events circumstances or developments or otherwise

strategy and operational risks 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 1 business for more information on our business strategy

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following



 

in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by other factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses subcontractor costs and availability and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all

our operations must comply with extensive existing regulations and changes in regulations andor enforcement of regulations can restrict or alter our operations increase our operating costs increase our tax rate or require us to make additional capital expenditures

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the us and canada have a substantial impact on our operations and compliance with such regulations is costly many complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions restrict our operations at times and may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as

 

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills require us at times to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently we have significant financial 

obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills and we establish accruals for these estimated costs expenditures could be accelerated or materially exceed our accruals due to the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or thirdparty landfill operators environmental regulatory changes new information about waste types previously collected such as pfas or other emerging contaminates and other reasons

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however federal state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations for packaging including traditional recyclables such as cardboard bottles and cans if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills transfer stations mrfs and other disposal facilities involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures additionally we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability releases of hazardous materials and odors that are sometimes triggered by weather or natural disasters there are also risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate landfill gas and odors we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage and property damage or destruction

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training compliance and response and recovery programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand additionally a major operational failure even if suffered by a competitor may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry with a corresponding increase in operating expense

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subjected or seek to impose liability on us for alleged environmental damage federal state and local governments are also increasingly adopting requirements for environmental justice reviews as part of certain permitting decisions these policies generally require permitting agencies to give heightened attention to the potential for projects to disproportionately impact lowincome and minority communities responding to permit challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or 

expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key team members and a highquality workforce or if our succession planning does not develop an adequate pipeline of future leaders it could disrupt our business jeopardize our strategic priorities and result in increased costs negatively impacting our results of operations

our operations require us to attract hire develop and retain a highquality workforce to provide a superior customer experience this includes key individuals in leadership and specialty roles as well as a very large number of drivers technicians and other frontline and backoffice team members necessary to provide our environmental services we experience significant competition to hire and retain individuals for certain frontline positions such as commercial truck drivers from within and outside our industry also see item 1a risk factors — market disruption including labor shortages and supply chain constraints and macroeconomic pressures including the heightened pace of inflation have adversely impacted our business and results of operations  additionally the market for employees that serve on our digital team is highly competitive as we have accelerated our investments in our digital platform it is increasingly important that we are able to attract and retain employees with the skills and expertise necessary to implement and manage our technologyled strategy we also compete to attract skilled business leaders and our own key team members are sought after by our competitors and other companies we make significant investments and engage in extensive internal succession planning to provide us with a robust pipeline of future leaders if we are not able to attract hire develop and retain a highquality workforce with the necessary skills and expertise as well as key leaders or if we experience significant employee turnover it can result in business and strategic disruption increased costs and loss of institutional knowledge which could negatively impact our results of operations 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the wm brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents or challenges to our assertions of social and environmental responsibility could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our services and potentially have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand

we have made significant investments in an extensive natural gas truck fleet which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices and requirements to transition to other vehicle types could impair these investments

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet however natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in the us and canada as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program

there is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavyduty truck industry and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology such as electric powered vehicles rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles this is resulting in a reduction in tax incentives and grants for natural gas trucks although current options for heavyduty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations 

we are proactively engaging in pilots of electric powered heavyduty vehicles and anticipate that we could redirect future planned capital investments in our fleet toward these assets when the vehicles prove economically and operationally viable should regulation mandate an accelerated transition to electric powered vehicles our cost to acquire vehicles needed to service our customers could increase capital investment required to establish sufficient charging infrastructure could be significant and investments we have made in an industryleading natural gas fleet and infrastructure could be impaired

increases in our labor costs as a result of labor unions organizing changes in regulations related to labor unions or increases in employee minimum wages could adversely affect our future results

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful would enhance organized labor’s leverage to obtain higher than expected wage and benefits costs and resist the introduction of new technology and other initiatives which can result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes additionally a large portion of our workforce are hourly personnel and many of these individuals particularly in our recycling business are paid at rates related to federal and state minimum wages increases in minimum wage rates or the enactment of new wagerelated legislation may significantly increase our labor costs any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events resulting from climate change and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance may not be indicative of our future results

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results of the geographic areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the geographic areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time due to significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins

for these and other reasons operating results in any period may not be indicative of operating results for any other period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results

external economic and industry risks 

the covid19 global pandemic has caused a significant disruption in social and commercial activity throughout north america and the continuation of the covid19 pandemic or other similar pandemic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

during 2020 and continuing into 2021 federal state and local governments throughout north america imposed varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of covid19 the pandemic and related measures have had a significant adverse impact on many sectors of the economy including environmental services the initial business closures and negative impact on general economic conditions resulted in volume declines and reductions in customers’ waste service needs which negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows in particular covid19 caused decreases in volumes in higher margin businesses impacting key financial metrics

throughout 2021 our volumes recovered from the sharp decline experienced in april 2020 with minimal impact from the resurgence in transmission of covid19 associated with recent virus variants as communities and businesses remained open however uncertainty remains with respect to various factors that influence the pace of economic recovery including factors discussed in the two risk factors immediately below the potential for future resurgence in transmission of covid19 and related business closures due to covid19 variants or other pandemic conditions could adversely impact our volumes and costs in the future if such conditions were to deepen and extend the broadbased economic slowdown it may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and hinder our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategy additionally if a large portion of our employee base were to become ill it could impact our ability to provide timely and reliable service

governmental regulations requiring mandatory covid19 vaccination of employees could adversely impact our ability to perform or compete for certain contracts and negatively affect our results of operations 

in september 2021 president biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with us government contracts to ensure that their usbased employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts with some exceptions to be fully vaccinated against covid19 we are currently party to certain service agreements with the us government the vaccine mandate is facing legal challenges and currently is enjoined nationwide in november 2021 osha announced an emergency temporary standard “ets” mandating either full vaccination against covid19 or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees however the agency withdrew the ets in january 2022 following an unfavorable decision by the us supreme court osha has indicated that it will continue to pursue the vaccine and testing requirements of the ets through the traditional rulemaking process and additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate we cannot currently predict the impact of any such vaccine requirements on our workforce although implementation may result in our inability to perform or compete for certain contracts as well as significant cost operational disruption attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs in the alreadyconstrained labor market

market disruption including labor shortages and supply chain constraints and macroeconomic pressures including the heightened pace of inflation have adversely impacted our business and results of operations 

certain macroeconomic pressures and market disruption driven in part by the covid19 pandemic intensified during the second half of 2021 and are continuing the constrained labor market has resulted in increased costs for wage adjustments overtime hours and training new hires to address operational challenges servicing customers the covid19 pandemic and the constrained labor market have also contributed to significant global supply chain disruption and inflationary pressure for the goods and services we purchase with a particular impact on our repair and maintenance costs supply chain constraints have also caused delayed delivery of fleet steel containers and other purchases aspects of our business rely on thirdparty transportation providers and such services have become more limited and expensive additionally we are currently experiencing margin pressures from commoditydriven business impacts particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices the extent and duration of the impact of these labor market supply chain and transportation challenges are subject to numerous factors including the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic size location and qualifications of the labor pool behavioral changes wage and price structures adoption of new or revised regulations and broader macroeconomic conditions if we are not able to overcome limitations on labor availability it could materially impact our ability to service our customers and our financial results 

accelerated and pronounced economic pressures such as the recent inflationary cost pressures on labor and the goods and services we rely upon to deliver service to our customers have had and continue to have a significant impact on our cost structure and capital expenditures significant components of our operating expenses vary directly as we experience changes in revenue due to volume and a heightened pace of inflation and we may not be able to dynamically manage our cost structure in response to such changes a significant portion of our revenue is tied to a price escalation index with a lookback provision resulting in a timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs under those contracts during this period of rapid inflation separately for many of our customers we provide services under multiyear contracts that can restrict our ability to increase prices and the timing of such increases our overall strategic pricing efforts are focused on recovering as much of the inflationary cost increases we experience in our business as possible by increasing our average unit rate but such efforts may not be successful for various reasons including the pace of inflation operating cost inefficiencies contractual limitations and market responses the inability to adequately increase prices to offset increased 

costs and inflationary pressures or otherwise mitigate the impact of these macroeconomic conditions and market disruptions on our business will increase our costs of doing business and reduce our margins if such impacts are prolonged and substantial they could have a material negative effect on our results of operations

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices and commodity prices for recyclable materials are particularly susceptible to volatility based on regulations and tariffs that affect our ability to export products

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products attention on waste in the environment has led to new international laws restricting the flow of certain recyclables as an example on january 1 2021 new restrictions on the international trade of most plastics went into effect as part of the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal at this time the us is not a party to the basel convention but most countries to which we export commodities are which may limit our ability to export certain plastics

in recent years changes in regulations affecting the international flow of recyclables have led to a reduction in export activity for recyclables higher quality requirements and higher processing costs covid19 placed additional financial stress on recyclers and municipalities resulting in some recycling programs being paused or eliminated these changes have led to a number of states considering epr regulations

prices and demand for recyclables fluctuate recycling revenue increased 537 million and 75 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively as compared with the prior year periods primarily from higher market prices for recycling commodities to support recent increases in both quality requirements and demand for commodities we have increased our investment in recycling infrastructure and the size of our recycling operations this in turn increases our exposure to commodity price fluctuations additionally future regulation tariffs international trade policies or other initiatives may impact supply and demand of material or increase operating costs which could impact the profitability of our recycling operations

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products significant variations in the price of biogas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in a corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our ees business demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices such as the low prices throughout the last few years any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and bans on certain types of waste could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of materials at landfills such as recyclables cardboard bottles and cans yard waste food waste and electronics where organic waste is not banned from the landfill some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of the us and canada’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and providing alternative services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives

with a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities and states across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use the most common materials banned include plastic bags and straws polystyrene plastic and some types of single use packaging these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling and composting programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials however there are currently no viable end markets for recycling many of these materials and inclusion of such materials in our recycling stream increases contamination and operating costs that can negatively affect the results of our recycling operations

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect revenues for environmental services and our income from operations margins

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which negatively impacts the ability to grow through new business or service upgrades and may result in customer turnover and reduction in customers’ waste service needs consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may also reduce the number and variety of services requested by customers additionally a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows 

a decrease in waste volumes generated results in an increase in competitive pricing pressure such economic conditions may also interfere with our ability to implement our pricing strategy many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase more than the increase if any in the consumer price index this is partially due to our relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels and vendor costs and may not correlate with the consumer price index or the waste industry

weakness in the economy may expose us to credit risk of governmental entities and municipalities and other major customers which could negatively impact our financial results

we provide service to a number of governmental entities municipalities and large national accounts during periods of economic weakness governmental entities and municipalities can suffer significant financial difficulties due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures during these periods such entities and our nongovernmental customers could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates

purchasers of our recycling commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2021 we had 645 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with interest rates reset on a weekly basis if market dynamics resulted in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we would incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows

the company’s effective tax rate and tax liability could materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors

predominantly all of the company’s revenues are generated in the us and changes in us tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate financial condition and results of operations the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 the “tax act” had a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax expenses and net deferred tax liabilities the tax act reduced the us corporate statutory tax rate and eliminated or limited the deduction of several expenses that were previously deductible among other things however future changes in tax laws could reverse the impacts of the tax act and the current presidential administration has previously indicated support for increasing the us corporate statutory tax rate if ultimately enacted into law such an increase could materially impact our tax provision cash tax liability effective tax rate and net deferred tax liabilities

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations fuel supply shortages and price increases could substantially increase our operating expenses we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally lawsuits have challenged our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins

technology and information security risks 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that innovate our operations 

improve the customer experience and provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste we are continuing our multiyear commitment to strategic investments in technology including accelerated investments in customer service digitalization research development and implementation of enhanced technology often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or implementation of technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on these investments further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected cost savings or other benefits significant system failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations employee workfromhome arrangements prompted by the covid19 pandemic increase various technology risks including potential exposure to cyber incidents loss of data fraud internal control challenges and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing company systems and information remotely in the course of their ordinary work

we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning and human capital management system and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations 

we are in the process of a complex multiyear implementation of a new enterprise resource planning and human capital management “erphcm” system the erphcm system implementation requires the integration of the new system with multiple new and existing information systems and business processes and is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information to our management team important to the operation of the business such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective and we have made interim adjustments to our implementation timeline to accommodate aspects that have proven more difficult or time consuming than initially predicted any material disruptions delays deficiencies or cost increases associated with the design and implementation of our new erphcm system could adversely affect our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations resulting in negative impacts on our business and operations and subject us to potential liability additionally our implementation of the erphcm system involves greater utilization of thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations problems faced by us or our thirdparty providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods

significant cybersecurity incidents negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers vendors and employees and expose us to increased liability

substantially all aspects of our business operations rely on digital technology we use computers mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees customers and vendors these uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber intrusions and we must commit substantial resources to continuously monitor and further develop our networks and infrastructure to prevent detect and address the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events our security programs and measures do not prevent all intrusions cyber intrusions require a significant amount of time and effort to assess and remedy and our incident response efforts may not be effective in all cases the company experienced a cyber intrusion in the first quarter of 2021 that was promptly detected and the thirdparty software vulnerability was quickly remediated there was no impact to the company’s operations services or financial statements a subsidiary of wmi provided notice to potentially affected individuals us state and federal regulators and canadian regulators as a result of the cyber intrusion regulatory investigations may result in costs fines penalties or other obligations additionally a subsidiary of wmi is party to a class action case related to this incident the company intends to vigorously defend itself against any such proceedings and does not expect that the outcome of any proceedings related to the 2021 incident will have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows however assessing and responding to this intrusion required a significant amount of time and management attention an incident that results in a material theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or material interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption direct financial loss negative publicity brand damage alleged violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential regulatory enforcement or private litigation liability and competitive disadvantage while we do maintain insurance for cyber incidents due to policy terms limits and exclusions it may not apply in all cases and it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities incurred

as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk certain new technologies such as use of autonomous vehicles remotecontrolled equipment and virtual reality present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks 

increased regulation by state and federal governments related to cybersecurity protections and disclosures may require additional resources for compliance and any inability or perceived inability to adequately address new requirements could subject us to regulatory enforcement private litigation public criticism disrupt our operations cause us to lose customers result in additional costs and legal liability damage our reputation and otherwise harm our business

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection issues and expanding laws could negatively impact our business subject us to criticism and expose us to increased liability 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future we collect certain personally identifiable information and other sensitive information as integral parts of our business and in connection with providing services to our customers we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern the collection and use of such information obtained from individuals and businesses these laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving interpretations government officials regulators privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data we must continually monitor the development and adoption of new and emerging laws and regulations and commit substantial time and resources towards compliance with new laws and regulations these laws provide disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information individual rights relating to personal information collection and storage requirements automated decisionmaking transparency and potential liability expansion any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newly acquired companies could subject us to regulatory enforcement private litigation public criticism disrupt our operations cause us to lose customers result in additional costs and legal liability damage our reputation and otherwise harm our business

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if it is alleged that our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved and for conditions resulting from waste types or compounds previously considered nonhazardous but later determined to present possible threat to public health or the environment the risks of successor liability and emerging contaminants are of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially through acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which governmental entities private groups or individuals seek to impose liability on us for alleged environmental damage or violation of statutes or desire to revoke or deny permits required for our operations we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant

changes to federal and state renewable fuel policies could affect our financial performance in that sector as a renewable fuel producer and impact our projected future investments 

the primary drivers of renewable fuel development at our landfills are federal and state incentive programs such as the federal rfs program and the california low carbon fuel standard at the federal level oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as rins from renewable fuel producers the company has invested and continues to invest in facilities that capture and convert landfill and dairy digester gas into renewable natural gas so that we can participate in the program and the company has stated its intention to grow its asset base to notably increase its rng production by 2026 rins prices generally respond to regulations enacted by the epa or other regulatory bodies as well as fluctuations in supply and demand the value of the rins associated with renewable natural gas is set through a market established by the program each year the epa is required to finalize a rule establishing refiners’ obligations to purchase renewable natural gas and other cellulosic biofuels under the rfs program market uncertainty stemming from these annual rulemakings as well as the epa’s administration of other aspects of the rfs program led to a rapid decline in rin values in 2019 and much of 2020 before rebounding in november 2020 we will continue to advocate for the current administration to implement policies that ensure longterm stability for renewable transportation fuels changes in the rfs market the structure of the rfs program or rins prices and demand can and has impacted the financial performance of the facilities constructed to capture and treat the gas and could impact or alter our projected future investments

the impact of climate change and the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our costs to operate

we continue to assess the physical risks to our operations from the effects of climate change although we have made investments to mitigate risk associated with severe storm events damage to our facilities or disruption of service caused 

by more frequent or more severe storms associated with climate extremes could negatively impact operating results we have also identified risk to our assets and our employees associated with drought or water scarcity flooding extreme heat and rain events and fire conditions associated with climate change for example wildfires influenced by climate change can damage landfill infrastructure such as gas collection systems flooding in lowlying areas enhanced by sea level rise can result in greater maintenance expenses at our facilities and service disruption and more frequent or extreme rain events can erode the protective vegetative caps on our landfills and generate increased volumes of leachate to manage those areas of the country most prone to these occurrences have protocols in place or are developing protocols to address these conditions including employee safety driver training and equipment and facility protection protocols we have incurred and will incur costs to develop and implement these protocols and these protocols may not be effective in offsetting these risks additionally the actions of others in response to climate change effects such as the rolling power blackouts implemented in california in 2019 due to wildfire risks can result in service disruptions and increase our costs to operate

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state provincial regional and federal levels to cap andor curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change we continue to monitor these efforts and the potential impacts to our operations should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with us or foreign laws or regulations

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements

as a large company with operations across the us and canada we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business including governmental proceedings actions that have been filed against us and that may be filed against us in the future include personal injury property damage commercial customer and employmentrelated claims including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to

 

the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity

financial risks 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our 

access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile and several other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by thirdparty rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected

additionally we have 25 billion of debt as of december 31 2021 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the impact of our commercial paper borrowings and taxexempt bonds if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow

we may use our 35 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in november 2024 as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility we had 167 million of letters of credit issued and 18 billion of outstanding borrowings net of related discount on issuance under our commercial paper program both supported by this facility leaving unused and available credit capacity of 15 billion as of december 31 2021 in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size to the extent our obligations for claims are more than we estimated our insurance coverage is inadequate to cover our obligations or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations the requirement that we pay such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt and final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wmi financial guarantees our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may increase the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be required to deposit cash to collateralize certain obligations which could negatively impact our liquidity

we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that have in the past and may in the future lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of 

goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we have in the past and may in the future be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans “multiemployer pension plans” for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal depending on various factors including potential legislative changes future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period and our ongoing costs of participation in multiemployer pension plans may increase see notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2021 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto

overview

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services providing services throughout the united states “us” and canada we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy we own or operate the largest network of landfills throughout the us and canada in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste 

decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity or natural gas additionally we are a leading recycler in the us and canada handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provide collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services consistent with our company’s longstanding commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship we published our 2021 sustainability report which details our peoplefirst commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe resilient and sustainable the information in this report can be found at httpssustainabilitywmcom but it does not constitute a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k for further discussion see section “ regulation – emerging trends in policy and regulation – climate and sustainability ” in item 1

in 2021 our senior management began evaluating overseeing and managing the financial performance of our solid waste operations through two operating segments our east tier primarily consists of geographic areas located in the eastern us the great lakes region and substantially all of canada our west tier primarily includes geographic areas located in the western us including the upper midwest region and british columbia canada each of our solid waste operating segments provides integrated environmental services including collection transfer recycling and disposal the company finalized the assessment of our segments during the fourth quarter of 2021 the east and west tiers are presented in this report and constitute our existing solid waste business

our solid waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fees which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business described under results of operations below

acquisition of advanced disposal services inc “advanced disposal” 

on october 30 2020 we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of advanced disposal for 3030 per share in cash pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated april 14 2019 as amended on june 24 2020 total enterprise value of the acquisition was 46 billion when including approximately 18 billion of advanced disposal’s net debt this acquisition grew our footprint and allows us to provide differentiated sustainable waste management and recycling services to approximately three million new commercial industrial and residential customers primarily located in the eastern half of the us the acquisition was funded using a 30 billion 364day us revolving credit facility “364day revolving credit facility” and our commercial paper program in november 2020 we issued 25 billion of senior notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364day revolving credit facility at which time it was terminated as a result of the acquisition we recorded 41 billion of net assets including 25 billion of goodwill as of december 31 2020 postclosing adjustments to our purchase price allocation were not material 

in connection with our acquisition of advanced disposal we and advanced disposal entered into an agreement that provided for gfl environmental to acquire a combination of assets from us and advanced disposal to address divestitures required by the us department of justice immediately following the acquisition the divestiture transactions were consummated and the company subsequently received cash proceeds from the sale of 856 million

see note 11 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information

for the year ended december 31 2021 we incurred 51 million of integration related costs and for the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred 156 million of acquisition and integration related costs which were primarily classified as “selling general and administrative expenses” the postclosing operating results of advanced disposal have been included in our consolidated financial statements within our existing reportable segments postclosing through december 31 2020 advanced disposal recognized 205 million 142 million and 60 million of revenue operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses respectively which are included in our consolidated statement of operations during 2021 we made significant progress on our integration of advanced disposal the focus of these efforts has been to ensure that we continue to provide uninterrupted service to our customers through the integration of certain customer facing and back office digital platforms 

covid19 update 

throughout the covid19 pandemic the company has proactively taken steps to put our employees’ and customers’ needs first and we continue to work with the appropriate regulatory agencies to ensure we can provide our essential services safely and efficiently we continue to operate with a focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees and maintaining business continuity for our customers these efforts combined with our disciplined execution in our daily operations have positioned the company to prudently manage the challenges presented by covid19 

the impacts of covid19 on the global economy increased rapidly during the second quarter of 2020 affecting our business in most geographies and across a variety of our customer types over the last year our volumes have been recovering from the sharp decline experienced in april 2020 as a result of covid19 the pace of recovery in our volumes accelerated in the second quarter of 2021 and continued in the backhalf of 2021 with minimal impact from the resurgence in transmission of recent covid19 virus variants as communities and businesses remained open the portions of our business that had the most pronounced decreases in volume due to the pandemic were our industrial and commercial collection businesses and construction and demolition and special waste volumes at our landfills as we completed 2021 volumes in each of these lines of business were either on par with prepandemic levels or have now surpassed 2019 volumes we continue to be optimistic about our volume recovery and overall economic recovery from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic however uncertainty remains with respect to various factors that influence the pace of economic recovery and the potential for future resurgence in transmission of covid19 and related business closures due to virus variants or otherwise such conditions could adversely impact our volumes and costs in the future

business environment 

the waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry however customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills we monitor these developments to adapt our service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we promote our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs this includes expanding traditional recycling services increasing organics collection and processing and expanding our renewable energy projects to meet the evolving needs of our diverse customer base as the leading waste management environmental services provider in north america we are taking big bold steps in an effort to catalyze positive change – change that will impact our company as well as the communities we serve our sustainability agenda includes expanding recycling and focuses on meeting or exceeding specific 2025 and 2038 sustainability goals around people customers the environment and community which align with eight of the united nations sustainable development goals

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private service providers based on pricing and to a much lesser extent the nature of service offerings particularly in the residential line of business our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors including increases and decreases in consumer spending business expansions and construction activity these factors generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and impact our revenue negative economic conditions including the impact of covid19 can and have caused customers to reduce their service needs such negative economic conditions in addition to competitor actions can and have made it more challenging to implement our pricing strategy and negotiate renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins we also encounter competition for acquisitions and growth opportunities general economic factors 

and the market for consumer goods in addition to regulatory developments can also significantly impact commodity prices for the recyclable materials we sell significant components of our operating expenses vary directly as we experience changes in revenue due to volume and a heightened pace of inflation volume changes can fluctuate dramatically by line of business and volume changes in higher margin businesses such as what we saw with covid19 can impact key financial metrics we must dynamically manage our cost structure in response to volume changes and cost inflation

we believe the company’s industryleading asset network and strategic focus on investing in our people and our digital platform will give the company the necessary tools to address the evolving challenges impacting the company and our industry in line with our commitment to continuous improvement and a differentiated customer experience we remain focused on our customer service digitalization initiative to change the way we interact with our customers enhancements made through this initiative are intended to seamlessly and digitally connect all the company’s functions required to service our customers in order to provide the best experience and service additionally in early 2022 we substantially implemented our new enterprise resource planning system which will drive operational and service excellence by empowering our people through a modern simplified and connected employee experience

certain macroeconomic pressures and market disruption driven in part by the covid19 pandemic intensified during the second half of 2021 and are continuing the constrained labor market has resulted in increased costs for wage adjustments overtime hours and training new hires to address frontline employee turnover increased volume and operational challenges servicing customers the covid19 pandemic and the constrained labor market have also contributed to significant global supply chain disruption and inflationary pressure for the goods and services we purchase with a particular impact on our repair and maintenance costs supply chain constraints have also caused delayed delivery of fleet steel containers and other purchases aspects of our business rely on thirdparty transportation providers and such services have become more limited and expensive additionally we are currently experiencing margin pressures from commoditydriven business impacts particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices the extent and duration of the impact of these labor market supply chain and transportation challenges are subject to numerous factors including the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic size location and qualifications of the labor pool behavioral changes wage and price structures adoption of new or revised regulations including vaccine mandates and broader macroeconomic conditions as costs increase we focus on our strategic pricing efforts as well as operating efficiencies and cost controls to maintain and grow our earnings and cash flow with increased pressure from the strong economic recovery particularly on labor we remain focused on putting our people first to ensure that they are well positioned to diligently and safely execute our daily operations we are encouraged by our results in 2021 and remain focused on delivering outstanding customer service managing our variable costs with changing volumes and investing in technology that will enhance our customers’ experience and reduce our cost to serve

current year financial results 

during 2021 we delivered strong revenue and income from operations as we continued to experience higher yield and volume recovery in our landfill commercial and industrial collection businesses and benefited from the acquisition of advanced disposal however our income from operations was impacted by constraints on labor availability and inflationary cost pressures primarily in the second half of 2021 we continue to invest in our people through market wage adjustments investments in our digital platform and training for new team members in addition we are focused on executing on our disciplined pricing programs to drive margin growth in the face of these additional labor cost and inflationary pressures we also made significant investments in recycling automation technology and customer service digitalization to further support our continued focus on optimizing operational efficiency as well as achieving improved labor productivity for all lines of business during 2021 the company allocated 1904 million of available cash to capital expenditures we also allocated 2320 million of available cash to our shareholders during 2021 through dividends and common stock repurchases

our overall strategic pricing efforts are focused on recovering as much of the inflationary cost increases we experience in our business as possible by increasing our average unit rate we experienced strong average yield growth in our collection line of business of 42 in 2021 up from 25 in 2020 showing our focus on our pricing efforts in this inflationary environment we are driving improvements in our residential line of business aligning the price charged for services we provide to our customers with the costs to provide the services resulting in increased average yield in 2021 of 45 up from 29 in 2020 we are also continuing to see growth in our landfill and transfer businesses with our municipal solid waste business experiencing 32 average yield growth for 2021 compared to 23 in 2020 a significant portion of our revenue is tied to a price escalation index with a lookback provision which has resulted in a timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs under those contracts during this period of rapid inflation separately for many of our customers we provide services under multiyear contracts that can restrict our ability to increase prices and the timing of such increases as we enter 2022 many of these contract lookback provisions will begin to capture the recent inflationary cost increases

recycling — recycling revenue increased 537 million and 75 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively as compared with the prior year periods primarily from higher market prices for recycling commodities average market prices for recycling commodities at the company’s facilities were approximately 115 and 19 higher in 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared with the prior year periods market prices began to increase in 2020 from the unprecedented lows experienced in 2019 largely due to covid19 related decreases in the supply of recycled materials demand for recycled materials strengthened in the backhalf of 2020 and continued in 2021 outpacing supply driven by the growth in ecommerce businesses reopening and manufacturers committing to use more recycled content in their packaging we have also maintained our focus on converting to a feebased pricing model that ensures fees paid by customers address the cost of processing materials and the impact on our cost structure of managing contamination in the recycling stream

fuel surcharges and other — these fees which include our fuel surcharge program yield from our wm renewable energy business and other mandated fees increased 240 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 and decreased 151 million in 2020 as compared with 2019 fuel surcharge revenues are based on and fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel and also vary with changes in our volumebased revenue activity market prices for diesel fuel were almost 30 higher in 2021 when compared with 2020 as diesel fuel prices began to increase towards the end of 2020 and continued to increase throughout 2021 consistent with the general downturn in oil and gas markets in 2020 market prices for diesel fuel were approximately 16 lower in 2020 as compared to 2019 additionally we transitioned certain customers’ pricing away from a fuel surcharge in 2020 reflecting the cost of fuel in the base rates we charge for our services which further contributed to the decline in 2020 as compared with 2019 revenue from our wm renewable energy business increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily driven by the increase in value for renewable fuel standard credits the other fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these amounts have not significantly impacted the change in revenue for the periods presented 

volume

our revenues from volume excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures increased 435 million or 28 in 2021 as compared with 2020 and decreased 692 million or 45 in 2020 as compared with 2019 

over the last year our volumes have been recovering from the sharp decline experienced in april 2020 as a result of covid19 the pace of recovery in our volumes accelerated in the second quarter of 2021 and continued in the backhalf of 2021 with minimal impact from the resurgence in transmission of recent covid19 virus variants as communities and businesses remained open the portions of our business that had the most pronounced decreases in volume due to the pandemic were our industrial and commercial collection businesses and our landfill volumes as we completed 2021 volumes in each of these lines of business were either on par with prepandemic levels or have now surpassed 2019 volumes we continue to be optimistic about volume recovery and overall economic recovery from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic however uncertainty remains with respect to various factors that influence the pace of economic recovery and the potential for future resurgence in transmission of covid19 and related business closures due to virus variants or otherwise such conditions could adversely impact our volumes in the future in addition our wmsbs business volume grew from our continued focus on a differentiated service model for national accounts customers 

acquisitions and divestitures 

acquisitions and divestitures resulted in a net increase in revenues of 983 million or 65 and 240 million or 16 in 2021 and 2020 respectively as compared with the prior year periods primarily due to our acquisition of advanced disposal 

operating expenses

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits costs excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business including certain rebates paid to suppliers vi fuel costs net of tax credits for alternative fuel which represent the costs of fuel to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and x other operating costs which include gains and losses on sale of assets telecommunications equipment and facility lease expenses property taxes utilities and supplies variations in volumes yearoveryear as discussed above in operating revenues  in addition to cost inflation affect the comparability of the components of our operating expenses

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

our operating expenses for 2021 increased as compared with 2020 primarily due to i increased volumes from the acquisition of advanced disposal ii commoditydriven business impacts particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices iii volume recovery from earlier pandemic lows iv labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth and v inflationary cost pressures primarily in the second half of 2021 these impacts were partially offset by our continued focus on operating efficiency and efforts to control costs as volumes grow

our operating expenses for 2020 decreased as compared with 2019 primarily due to decreases in our landfill and industrial and commercial collection volumes and our proactive steps to manage our variable costs in response to the volume declines resulting from covid19 impacts the revenue declines due to the covid19 pandemic had a greater impact on our higher margin lines of business and negatively impacted operating costs as a percentage of revenues in addition our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was impacted by our acquisition of advanced disposal as the acquired business’s operating cost structure was higher than ours and we incurred certain onetime upfront costs

significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 was largely driven by i increased labor and related benefits costs related to our acquisition of advanced disposal ii merit and proactive market wage adjustments to hire and retain talent iii volume increases particularly in our commercial and industrial collection businesses which when combined with driver shortages and turnover in certain markets increased overtime and training hours iv higher annual incentive compensation and v increases in health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activity generally returning to prepandemic levels the decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely driven by decreases in volume in our industrial and commercial collection businesses our proactive steps positioned us to optimize our route structure to respond to lower industrial and commercial collection volumes additionally the decrease was attributable to i improved efficiency ii lower headcount due to employee attrition coupled with proactive steps to defer hiring due to covid19 driven uncertainty and iii lower annual incentive compensation these decreases were offset in part by annual merit increases and the addition of employees as a result of our acquisition of advanced disposal

transfer and disposal costs  — the increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 was largely driven by increased volume which includes the volumes from our acquisition of advanced disposal and inflationary cost increases from our thirdparty haulers the decrease in transfer and disposal costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely driven by volume declines in our industrial and commercial collection businesses as a result of covid19 offset in part by additional disposal costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal

maintenance and repairs  — the increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 was largely driven by i our acquisition of advanced disposal including intentional investments to bring the acquired fleet to 

our standards ii inflationary cost increases for parts supplies and thirdparty services iii additional fleet maintenance driven by commercial and industrial collection volume increases iv labor cost pressure from our technicians including higher overtime from labor shortages v an increase in container repairs driven by volume increases and delays in normal course capital expenditures for steel containers due to both steel costs and supply chain constraints and vi increased building maintenance costs including improvements to facilities the decrease in maintenance and repairs costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely driven by proactive steps to optimize routes and reduce overtime hours to address the volume declines discussed above additionally the 2019 period was also impacted by a 16 million noncash charge to writeoff certain equipment costs related to our other segment this decline in costs was partially offset by intentional investments in the acquired advanced disposal fleet and inflationary cost pressures for both our company and thirdparty services due to demand for skilled technician labor as well as for parts and supplies 

subcontractor costs  — the increase in subcontractor costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 was largely driven by i inflationary cost increases from thirdparty haulers and higher volumes ii an increase in volumes in our wmsbs business which relies more extensively on subcontracted hauling than our collection and disposal business and iii the acquisition of advanced disposal the decrease in subcontractor costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely due to covid19 driven volume declines in our industrial collection business and projects ending or scaling down during 2020 in our ees business the decrease was offset in part by an increase in business activity in our wmsbs business 

cost of goods sold — the increase in cost of goods sold in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily driven by increases in market prices for recycling commodities of approximately 115 and to a lesser extent higher recycling volumes costs in 2020 were flat when compared with 2019 in spite of an increase in commodity prices largely due to lower recycling volumes as a result of covid19 additionally a higher percentage of our overall recycled commodity sales in 2020 were targeted at domestic markets resulting in lower freight costs

fuel — the increase in fuel costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily due to i increases of almost 30 in market prices for diesel fuel ii the acquisition of advanced disposal and iii volume increases in our commercial and industrial collection businesses the decrease in fuel costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to i a decline of approximately 15 in market prices for diesel fuel ii lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and iii volume declines the decreases were offset in part by i lower federal alternative fuel credits and ii additional costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — the increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily driven by i landfill volume increases ii disposal rate increases at certain landfills and iii additional costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal the decrease in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily related to lower landfill volumes largely driven by the impact of covid19 the decreases were offset in part by additional costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal 

landfill operating costs — the increase in landfill operating costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily due to volume increases which includes our acquisition of advanced disposal and increased testing and monitoring costs these increases were partially offset by i lower leachate management costs primarily due to the cessation of certain transportation costs in our east tier segment and ii changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in 2021 and 2020 our measurement of these balances includes application of a riskfree discount rate which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds in 2021 there was an increase in the discount rate which resulted in a reduction in the net liability balance and a credit to expense conversely in 2020 there was a decrease in the discount rate which resulted in an increase in the net liability balance and a charge to expense

the increase in landfill operating costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to higher leachate management costs compared to the prior year and additional costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal this increase was offset in part by decreases attributable to lower volumes at our landfills 

risk management  — the increase in risk management costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily due to our acquisition of advanced disposal and overall economic recovery increasing business activity and claim volumes and related costs risk management costs were relatively flat in 2020 as compared with 2019

other — other operating cost increases in 2021 as compared with 2020 were due to our acquisition of advanced disposal and increased equipment rental costs attributable in part to increased volumes and supply chain constraints slowing normal course fleet and equipment orders additionally during the second half of 2021 additional volumes and inflationary cost pressures drove an increase in various costs partially offsetting these was a favorable litigation settlement in 2021 additionally net gains on sales of certain assets during each year impacted the comparability of the reported periods

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefits costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising bank charges computer costs travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation reserves generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2021 as compared with 2020 increased primarily due to i higher incentive compensation costs ii strategic investments in our digital platform including planned investments in a new enterprise resource planning system and investments in customer service digitalization and iii increased labor support and integration costs following our acquisition of advanced disposal partially offsetting these increases are lower consulting advisory and legal fees from the 2020 acquisition of advanced disposal and improvements in our provision for bad debts as collections returned to prepandemic levels although our costs increased the significant revenue increase positioned us to reduce our overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues when compared with the prior year periods

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared with 2019 increased due to i incremental costs of approximately 150 million incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of advanced disposal ii strategic investments in our digital platform and iii an increase in the provision for bad debts due to negative impacts on customer receipts experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition to the cost increases selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased in 2020 due to the decline in volumerelated revenues 

​ 

significant items affecting the comparison of our selling general and administrative expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs for 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily due to i higher incentive compensation costs ii additional headcount including from our acquisition of advanced disposal iii annual merit increases for our employees iv costs associated with our strategic investments in our digital platform and v increases in health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activities generally returning to prepandemic levels from the lower level experienced during 2020 the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely due to i costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of advanced disposal including severance costs and additional headcount ii annual merit increases and iii costs associated with 

our strategic investments in our digital platform these cost increases were offset in part by i lower annual incentive compensation costs and ii proactive steps undertaken to defer hiring and reduce labor related costs 

professional fees  — professional fees decreased for 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to lower consulting advisory and legal fees following the completion of our acquisition of advanced disposal in 2020 partially offset by increased strategic investments in our digital platform and integration costs related to our acquisition of advanced disposal the increases in professional fees in 2020 as compared with 2019 were primarily driven by consulting advisory and legal fees incurred in connection with our acquisition and integration of advanced disposal and strategic investments in our digital platform 

provision for bad debts  — the decrease in provision for bad debts for 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily due to an overall improvement in customer account collections and decreased collection risk with certain customers the increase in the provision for bad debts in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to increased collection risk associated with certain customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

other — the increase in other expenses for 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily driven by costs associated with our acquisition of advanced disposal and increased technology infrastructure costs to support our strategic investments in our digital platform the decrease in other expenses in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to lower litigation costs and proactive measures taken to reduce discretionary costs such as travel and entertainment companywide these cost decreases were offset in part by increased technology infrastructure costs in 2020 to support strategic investments in our digital platform we also incurred onetime technology costs in 2020 to transition employees to workfromhome in response to the covid19 pandemic 

depreciation and amortization expenses

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2021 as compared with 2020 was related to our acquisition of advanced disposal and investments in capital assets including our fleet heavy equipment at our landfills and containers to service our customers the increase in amortization of landfill airspace in 2021 as compared with 2020 was driven by i changes in amortization rates driven by revisions in landfill estimates which includes changes in the anticipated timing of capping closure and postclosure activities ii our acquisition of advanced disposal and iii landfill volume increases from the economic recovery additionally 2020 benefited from a decrease in the inflation rate used to estimate capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily driven by the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of advanced disposal

the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily related to i investments in capital assets including our fleet and facilities and ii additional depreciation attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal the decrease in amortization of landfill airspace in 2020 as compared with 2019 was driven by i lower volumes at our landfills primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic and ii a decrease in the inflation rate used to estimate capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations from 25 to 225 at december 31 2020 these decreases were offset in part by charges to reflect changes in estimated landfill construction costs and our acquisition of advanced disposal 

our amortization of intangible assets was flat in 2020 as compared with 2019 the increased expense for intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of advanced disposal was offset primarily by decreases for certain customer list assets reaching the end of their lives

restructuring 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized 8 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our acquisition of advanced disposal during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 9 million of restructuring charges primarily related to modifying our field sales and customer services structures to better support our investment in customer service digitalization which is discussed above

gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net

the following table summarizes the major components of gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net for the year ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized net gains of 16 million primarily consisting of i a 35 million pretax gain from the recognition of cumulative translation adjustments on the divestiture of certain nonstrategic canadian operations in our east tier segment and ii an 8 million gain from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in our other segment these gains were partially offset by i a 20 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our corporate and other segment and ii 8 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to our wm renewable energy business within our other segment

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 35 million of net charges primarily related to i a 33 million net gain associated with net asset divestitures executed to address requirements of the us department of justice in connection with our acquisition of advanced disposal primarily within our west tier segment ii 41 million of noncash impairment charges primarily related to two landfills and an oil field waste injection facility in our west tier segment iii a 20 million noncash impairment charge in our east tier segment due to management’s decision to close a landfill once its constructed airspace is filled and abandon any remaining permitted airspace and iv 7 million of net charges primarily related to noncash impairments of certain assets within our wm renewable energy business in our other segment 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized asset impairments of 42 million related to i 27 million of goodwill impairment charges within our other segment of which 17 million related to our ees business and 10 million related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit and ii 15 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to certain solid waste operations in our west tier segment

income from operations

the following table summarizes income from operations for the year ended december 31 and has been updated to reflect our realigned segments which are discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements dollars in millions

 

 percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison

 

solid waste — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three years ended december 31 2021 are summarized below

 



 

additionally income from operations for our west tier segment was impacted by 41 million of noncash asset impairment charges primarily related to two landfills and an oil field waste injection facility income from operations for our east tier segment was impacted by a 20 million noncash impairment charge related to management’s decision to close a landfill once its constructed airspace is filled and abandon any remaining permitted airspace furthermore in 2019 our west tier segment benefited from the cleanup efforts of natural disasters primarily in california and similar efforts did not recur in 2020

other — the increase in income from operations for 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily driven by increased market values for renewable energy credits generated by our wm renewable energy business

income from operations for the other segment for 2020 as compared with 2019 was favorably impacted primarily by i volume increases in our wm renewable energy business as a result of a new renewable energy facility coming online ii our wmsbs business as a result of newly executed national account contracts and iii our recycling brokerage business

corporate and other — the most significant items affecting the results of operations for corporate and other during the three years ended december 31 2021 are summarized below

 

 

interest expense net

our interest expense net was 365 million 425 million and 411 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in interest expense net for 2021 was primarily due to certain refinancing activities as discussed further below including i the redemption of 30 billion of senior notes in july 2020 and the issuance of 25 billion of senior notes in november 2020 at lower rates and ii the retirement of 13 billion of certain highcoupon senior notes and concurrent issuance of 950 million of lower coupon senior notes in may 2021 the decreases were partially offset by decreases in interest income as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents balances in 2021 the increase in interest expense net for 2020 was primarily attributable to decreases in interest income resulting from lower cash and cash equivalents balances due to the redemption of 30 billion of senior notes with a special mandatory redemption feature the “smr notes” in july 2020 as discussed below in loss on early extinguishment of debt net  partially offsetting the decreases in interest income were favorable impacts due to a lower interest rate on our commercial paper borrowings as a result of the favorable interest rate environment in 2020 compared to 2019 

loss on early extinguishment of debt net 

in may 2021 wmi issued 950 million of senior notes which are discussed further below in summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations  concurrently we used the net proceeds from the newly issued senior notes of 942 million and available cash on hand to retire 13 billion of certain highcoupon senior notes the loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2021 includes 220 million of charges related to this tender offer including cash paid of 211 million related to premiums and other thirdparty costs and 9 million primarily related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these transactions

in july 2020 we recognized a 52 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations related to the mandatory redemption of the smr notes the loss includes 30 million of premiums paid and 22 million of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs pursuant to the terms of the smr notes we were required to redeem all of such outstanding notes paying debt holders 101 of the aggregate principal amounts of such notes plus accrued but unpaid interest as a result of the advanced disposal acquisition not being completed by july 14 2020 accordingly the redemption was completed on july 20 2020 using available cash on hand and to a lesser extent commercial paper borrowings the cash paid included the 30 billion principal amount of debt redeemed 30 million of related premiums and 8 million of accrued interest 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we repaid the outstanding borrowings under our 364day revolving credit facility and contemporaneously terminated the facility at which time we recognized a 2 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations related to unamortized debt issuance costs

at the time of acquisition advanced disposal had outstanding 425 million of 5625 senior notes due november 2024 in november 2020 we redeemed the notes pursuant to an optional redemption feature upon which we recognized a 1 million gain on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations due to the difference in carrying value and redemption price

​ 

in may 2019 wmi issued 40 billion of senior notes including 30 billion of smr notes we used 344 million of the proceeds from this offering to retire 257 million principal amount of certain highcoupon senior notes the cash paid to retire the highcoupon senior notes also included 84 million of related premiums which are classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations and 3 million of accrued interest 

in the third quarter of 2019 we elected to refund and reissue 99 million of taxexempt bonds which resulted in the recognition of a 1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities

we recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of 36 million 68 million and 55 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the losses for each period were primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties we generate tax benefits including tax credits from the losses incurred from these investments which are discussed further in notes 8 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in 2020 the entity that held and managed our ownership interest in the refined coal facility sold a majority of its assets resulting in a 7 million noncash impairment charge at that time additionally the 2019 period includes losses associated with our investment in a refined coal facility 

other net

we recognized other net income of 5 million in 2021 and 2020 compared to other net expense of 50 million in 2019 in 2019 we recognized a 52 million noncash impairment charge related to our minorityowned investment in a waste conversion technology business we wrote down our investment to its estimated fair value as the result of recent thirdparty investor’s transactions in these securities the fair value of our investment was not readily determinable thus we determined the fair value utilizing a combination of quoted price inputs for the equity in our investment level 2 and certain management assumptions pertaining to investment value level 3 

income tax expense

we recorded income tax expense of 532 million 397 million and 434 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively resulting in effective income tax rates of 226 209 and 206 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following

 

 

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis

we owned or operated 255 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2021 and 263 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2020 for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity as measured in tons of waste for the year ended december 31 and remaining airspace measured in cubic yards of waste as of december 31 in millions

 

 

the tons received at our landfills for the year ended december 31 are shown below tons in thousands

 



 

as of december 31 2021 we owned or controlled the management of 230 sites with remedial activities are in closure or have received a certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2021 and projected annual disposal volume the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 38 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume disposal prices construction and operating costs remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions — landfills section below although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume

the number of landfills owned or operated as of december 31 2021 segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows

 

 

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below

the changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended december 31 2021 are reflected in the table below in millions

 ​ 

as of december 31 2021 we estimate that we will spend approximately 639 million in 2022 and approximately 14 billion in 2023 and 2024 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations

as of december 31 2021 we had 14 landfills which were not accepting waste during the year ended december 31 2021 we performed tests of recoverability for five of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of 297 million for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values we did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining nine landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was not material

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated

the changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended december 31 2021 are reflected in the table below in millions

 

 

landfill operating costs — the following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the year ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

amortization of landfill airspace  — amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses includes the following

 

amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill net of accumulated amortization by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total permitted and expansion airspace final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated permitted and expansion airspace accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis for the year ended december 31

different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 260 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company each year 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company consistently generates cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds our working capital needs payment of our dividends investment in the business through capital expenditures and tuckin acquisitions and funding of strategic growth and sustainability investments we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business requirements that may arise during the year the company believes that its investment grade credit ratings large value of unencumbered assets and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital operating strategic and other liquidity requirements 

summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions

 

 

in addition to the above we also have recorded obligations related to liabilities associated with environmental remediation costs and noncancelable operating lease obligations which are discussed further in notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements respectively 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 in millions

 

 cash and cash equivalents — the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during 2021 is primarily due to the use of available cash to retire certain highcoupon senior notes in may 2021 which is discussed above in loss on early extinguishment of debt net 

debt — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our borrowings as of december 31 2021 are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements

as of december 31 2021 we had 31 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months including i 18 billion of shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program net of related discount on issuance ii 645 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities iii 500 million of 290 senior notes that mature in september 2022 and iv 170 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months including 71 million of taxexempt bonds as of december 31 2021 we have classified 24 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as long term because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our 35 billion longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility “35 billion revolving credit facility” the remaining 708 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations

as of december 31 2021 we also had 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with longterm scheduled maturities supported by letters of credit under our 35 billion revolving credit facility the interest rates on our variable rate taxexempt bonds are reset on a weekly basis through a remarketing process all recent taxexempt bond remarketings have successfully placed company bonds with investors at marketdriven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful however if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we have the availability under our 35 billion revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully accordingly we have classified the 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with maturities of more than one year as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021

in may 2021 wmi issued 950 million of senior notes consisting of 475 million of 200 senior notes due june 1 2029 and 475 million of 295 senior notes due june 15 2041 the net proceeds from these debt issuances were 942 million all of which were used along with available cash on hand to retire 13 billion of certain highcoupon senior notes the cash paid included the principal amount of the debt retired 211 million of related premiums and other thirdparty costs which are classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations and 15 million of accrued interest see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the debt transactions

summary of cash flow activity

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

net cash provided by operating activities — our operating cash flows for 2021 as compared with 2020 increased by 935 million primarily as a result of i an increase in earnings primarily attributable to our collection disposal and recycling lines of business ii our acquisition of advanced disposal iii lower interest payments in 2021 primarily due to certain refinancing activities and the retirement of highcoupon debt during 2020 reducing our overall interest rates iv lower income taxes paid in 2021 and v favorable changes in our working capital net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures our working capital was favorably impacted by process improvements that contributed to a significant improvement in our daystocollect metrics these favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash tax benefits received in 2020 associated with federal alternative fuel tax credits

our operating cash flows for 2020 as compared with 2019 decreased by 471 million as a result of i higher income tax payments related to a taxable gain on the sale of advanced disposal assets to gfl environmental ii increased interest payments and integration related spending due to our acquisition of advanced disposal iii payments associated with investments we made in our digital platform and iv to a lesser extent lower earnings on our traditional solid waste business primarily caused by the impact of the covid19 pandemic these results were partially offset by cash benefits in 2020 associated with the 2019 federal alternative fuel credits

net cash used in investing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below



 

net cash used in provided by financing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below

 



 

refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments

 

 

we announced in december 2021 that the board of directors has authorized up to 15 billion in future share repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations and listed below as well as market conditions

 

in december 2021 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0575 to 065 per share for dividends declared in 2022 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans growth and acquisitions and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant

 

free cash flow

we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities which is the most comparable gaap measure we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the year ended december 31 in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities longlived assets and intangible asset impairments and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities and iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events and the capping costs are amortized as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event at a landfill with remaining airspace the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill with remaining airspace the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria



 

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer on a quarterly basis 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately

environmental remediation liabilities 

a significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection the nature of our operations particularly with respect to the construction operation and maintenance of our landfills subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include prp investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely 

review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on

 

fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities 

significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of longlived tangible and intangible assets ie property and equipment intangible assets and goodwill during the impairment evaluation process in addition the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance

property and equipment including landfills and definitelived intangible assets — we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired

the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded

indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess the indefinitelived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using level 3 inputs

we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value if the assessment indicates a possible impairment we complete a quantitative review comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount fair value is typically estimated using an income approach however when appropriate we may also use a market approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units

fair value is computed using several factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis however we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable

acquisitions  — in accordance with the purchase method of accounting the purchase price paid for an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill when we are in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition there can be subsequent adjustments to our estimates of fair value and resulting preliminary purchase price allocation

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2021 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity

inflation

accelerated and pronounced economic pressures particularly related to inflationary cost pressures on labor and the goods and services we rely upon to deliver service to our customers had a more significant impact on our cost structure and capital expenditures in 2021 our overall strategic pricing efforts are focused on recovering as much of the inflationary cost increases we experience in our business as possible by increasing our average unit rate a significant portion of our revenue is tied to a price escalation index with a lookback provision which has resulted in a timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs under these contracts during this period of rapid inflation separately for many of our customers we provide services under multiyear contracts that can restrict our ability to increase prices and the timing of such increases as we enter 2022 many of these contract lookback provisions will begin to capture the recent inflationary cost increases in the price escalation calculation we are taking proactive steps to recover inflationary cost pressures through the price of our service and by managing our costs through efficiency labor productivity and investments in technology 

to automate certain aspects of our business in order to mitigate the inflationary cost pressures we have seen in our business refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates certain commodity prices and canadian currency rates from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks the company had no derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2021

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities as of december 31 2021 we had 135 billion of longterm debt excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs discounts and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives we have 25 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of i 18 billion of shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program ii 645 billion of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and iii 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on a weekly basis we currently estimate that a 100basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2022 interest expense by 7 million

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our fixedrate taxexempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive debt instruments this analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous 100basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately 900 million as of december 31 2021

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in highquality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis we also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in availableforsale securities including us treasury securities us agency securities municipal securities mortgage and assetbacked securities which generally mature over the next nine years as well as equity securities

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel electricity and recycled materials including old corrugated cardboard and plastics we work to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues operating costs and margins may also increase or decrease as discussed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we saw significant increases in commodity prices and demand for recycled materials in 2021 resulting in increased annual revenue for our recycling business of 537 million variability in commodity prices can also impact the margins of our business as certain components of our revenue are structured as a pass through of costs including recycling brokerage and fuel surcharges

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as certain support functions in india where significant we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income including operating revenue and operating expenses however the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations

wm was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wm and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wm wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries

our principal executive offices are located at 800 capitol street houston texas 77002 our telephone number is 713 5126200 our website address is wwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wm”

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services providing services throughout the united states “us” and canada we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provide collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the us during 2020 our largest customer represented less than 5 of annual revenues we employed approximately 48250 people as of december 31 2020

we own or operate 268 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in the us and canada in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage 348 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity we are a leading recycler in the us and canada handling materials that include cardboard paper glass plastic and metal we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada as well as other services that supplement our solid waste business

our company’s goals are targeted at putting our people first positioning them to serve and care for our customers the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders increasingly our industryleading focus on environmental sustainability aligns with demand from our customers who want more of their waste materials recovered waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address current needs while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs of our customers

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive 

our fundamental strategy has not changed we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement we have enabled a 

peoplefirst technologyled focus that leverages and sustains the strongest asset network in the industry to drive bestinclass customer experience and growth our strategic planning processes appropriately consider that the future of our business and the industry can be influenced by changes in economic conditions the competitive landscape the regulatory environment asset and resource availability and technology we believe that focused differentiation which is driven by capitalizing on our unique and extensive network of assets will deliver profitable growth and position us to leverage competitive advantages simultaneously we believe the combination of cost control process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations

we believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry and challenging economic environment in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program in december 2020 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0545 to 0575 per share for dividends declared in 2021 which is a 55 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2020 this is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows and marks the 18th consecutive year of dividend increases all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans growth and acquisitions and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 areas see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments we also provide expanded service offerings and solutions that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” the services we currently provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below

on october 30 2020 we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of advanced disposal services inc “advanced disposal” this acquisition expanded our collection and disposal business in a number of markets in the eastern half of the us the acquisition is discussed further in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements



 

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america as of december 31 2020 we owned or operated 263 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in the us and canada solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and thus thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including our cost to construct maintain and close the landfill the distance to an alternative disposal facility the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited and competition

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers

transfer as of december 31 2020 we owned or operated 348 transfer stations in the us and canada we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage we were the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix clean bottles cans paper and cardboard in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling volumes singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following

materials processing — through our collection operations and thirdparty customer base we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing as of december 31 2020 we operated 103 mrfs where cardboard paper glass metals plastics construction and demolition materials and other recycling commodities are recovered for resale or redirected for other purposes

recycling commodities — we market and resell recycling commodities globally we manage the marketing of recycling commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality

recycling brokerage services  — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recycling commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recycling commodities with minimal capital requirements

the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are received from various sources including third parties and our own operations in recent years we have been focused on reducing dependency on market prices for recycled commodities by recovering our processing costs first over time we have been transitioning our customer base from the traditional rebate model where we paid suppliers for the inbound material to a feeforservice model that ensures the cost of processing the recyclable materials is covered along with an acceptable margin with our current feeforservice model the pricing for these recyclable materials can either be a charge or “tip fee” when commodity pricing does not cover our cost to process the recyclable materials or a “rebate” when commodity pricing is higher than our processing costs and we are able to share this benefit with the customers generating recyclable materials in some cases our pricing is based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates generally this pricing also considers the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the pricing to our suppliers depending on the key terms of the arrangement these “rebates” are recorded as either operating expenses or a reduction in operating revenues within our consolidated statements of operations if the key terms result in a charge to the customer the associated “tip fees” would be recorded as operating revenues within our consolidated statements of operations

other other services we provide include the following

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic business solutions “wmsbs” business works with customers whose locations span the us and canada our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ waste management needs across multiple locations

our energy and environmental services “ees” business offers our customers a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our ees business but reflected principally in our collection line of business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this 

service are also reflected principally in our collection line of business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy business landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the us environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources as of december 31 2020 we had 146 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills for 104 of these projects the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 16 of these projects the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers for 26 of these projects the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes

we provide expanded service offerings and solutions that are not managed through our solid waste business including the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® business

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations while most of these investments are in the form of minority equity stakes they can also include joint ventures joint development agreements or majority equity stakes the solutions and services include i waste collection processing and recycling ii the development operation and marketing of waste processing facilities and technologies iii operation of renewable natural gas plants and iv the development and operation of organic recycling technologies furthermore we continually scout evaluate and run proofofconcepts of innovative technologies within our core operations to improve safety operational efficiencies and customer solutions

competition

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs

seasonal trends

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend 

to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results of the areas impacted on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time due to significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins

human capital resources

employees

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 48250 fulltime employees across the us canada and india approximately 45200 employees were located within the us and 3050 employees were located outside of the us approximately 9100 employees were employed in administrative and sales positions with the remainder in operations approximately 8750 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements additional information about our workforce can be found in our 2020 sustainability report at httpssustainabilitywmcom our 2020 sustainability report does not constitute a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report we file with or furnish to the sec whether made before or after the date of this annual report on form 10k

safety as a core value

at the company safety is a core value with no compromise a large number of our employee population work as drivers heavy equipment operators and sorters which are essential jobs that carry inherent risks for nearly 20 years we have engaged employees on safety through our mission to zero “m2z” program the “zero” in m2z represents zero tolerance for unsafe behaviors employees learn safety best practices through newhire and ongoing training to build upon lessons learned in training we conduct structured observations of frontline employees that cover all aspects of our collection and postcollection operations including driving loading unloading lifting and lowering and arriving prepared for work 

learning and development 

we offer expansive learning and development solutions to meet the development needs of our people and supporting opportunities for growth and improvement our talent management strategy is designed to reach employees at all levels given the wide variety of employee roles and skill sets in our company our training and development programs are varied but generally fall into the following categories i compliance including code of conduct and cybersecurity training ii safety iii environmental excellence iv professional development and leadership and v jobspecific

​ 

inclusion and diversity

fostering mutual trust and respect for one another is a cornerstone of being an inclusive and welcoming workplace one that is wellpositioned to serve our customers and communities inclusion and diversity “id” are part of the company’s core values we embrace and cultivate respect trust open communication and diversity of thought and people we are continually working to further embed id as central pillars of our culture to this end we established two aspirational goals to achieve by 2025 i achieve ethnic diversity in each segment of our workforce with an emphasis on improving representation of minorities in all aspects of our business including leadership and ii lead the industry in female representation at all levels with a special emphasis on operations and leadership to enable us to achieve these goals we have established a crossfunctional inclusion and diversity leadership council aimed at ensuring all of the company’s policies practices and procedures support these efforts

financial assurance and insurance obligations

financial assurance

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting certain variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii a whollyowned insurance captive the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility “35 billion revolving credit facility” and other credit lines established for that purpose

insurance

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including health and welfare general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation real and personal property directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability cyber incident 

liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy we use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs as of december 31 2020 both our commercial general liability insurance policy and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2020 our automobile liability insurance program included a perincident deductible of up to 10 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2020 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements

regulation

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the us and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in cases of violations

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations with acquisition development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage

the regulatory environment in which we operate is influenced by changes in leadership at the federal state provincial and local levels the policies set forth under the previous us administration for example generally were in favor of reducing regulation and corporate taxation while it is anticipated that the new us administration will reverse course on regulatory policies impacting our company we cannot predict what impact the change in administrations will have on specific regulations nor can we predict the timing of any such changes reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to the waste sector is a barrier to rapid entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve

the primary us federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below



 

we are also actively monitoring the following recent federal regulatory developments affecting our business



 

potential climate change ghg regulatory and corporate sustainability initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide lowcarbon services to our customers and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth we continue to anticipate the needs of our customers which include investing in and developing evermoreadvanced recycling and reuse technologies as the us and canada continue to explore various forms of ghg regulation that increase demand for lowcarbon service offerings the services we are developing are becoming increasingly valuable



 

state provincial and local regulations

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements

our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills the number of state and local governments with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however federal state provincial and local governments could take and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations for packaging including traditional recyclables such as cardboard bottles and cans if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations while fitness laws can present potential increased costs and barriers to entry into market areas these laws have not and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole

states and municipalities are also increasingly adopting requirements for environmental justice reviews as part of certain permitting decisions these policies generally require permitting agencies to give heightened attention to the potential for projects to disproportionately impact lowincome and minority communities our company supports policies seeking to advance high standards of environmental performance and the fair treatment of people of all races cultures and incomes nevertheless we are actively monitoring recent regulatory developments in this area as additional conditions imposed on permitting decisions could increase the time and cost involved to pursue and maintain necessary permits

recycling foreign import and export regulations and material restrictions

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2017 the chinese government announced bans on certain scrap materials and begun to enforce extremely restrictive quality and other requirements which significantly reduced china’s import of recyclables as of january 1 2021 china ceased importing virtually all recyclables including those exported by us many other markets both domestic and foreign have also tightened their quality expectations and limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables as an example on january 1 2021 new restrictions on the trade of most plastics went into effect as part of the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal the us is not a party to the basel convention but most countries to which we export are which may limit exports of certain plastics the impact of basel convention restrictions is unknown at this time but it will be mitigated by the fact that we no longer export residential recyclables

such trade restrictions have disrupted the global trade of recyclables particularly fiber creating excess supply and decreasing recyclable commodity prices the heightened quality requirements have been difficult for the industry to achieve and have driven up operating costs in particular singlestream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards as recyclable commodity prices have fallen and operating costs have increased recyclers are passing cost increases through to customers the resulting price increase for recycling services in communities and at businesses in the us has resulted in some customers reducing or eliminating their recycling service covid19 placed additional financial stress on municipalities resulting in recycling programs being paused or eliminated when combined with the impacts of the global markets shifts caused by china’s termination of imports the most recent financial stress has led to a number of states considering epr regulations which would shift the financial burden of recycling to the producers of products and goods industry trade organizations and government agencies are engaged in discussions to mitigate longterm impacts to recycling programs and the industry as a whole

for the past several years we have been working with stakeholders to educate the public on the need to recycle properly we are investing time and labor and working with customers to help improve quality and have seen improvement in the quality of material that we receive at our facilities we have continued our focus on developing a sustainable recycling business model that meets customers’ environmental needs by passing through the increasing cost of processing and higher contamination rates and these efforts had a positive impact on the operating results for our recycling business in 2020

with a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities and states across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use the most common materials banned include plastic straws polystyrene plastic and single use packaging these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials however with no viable end markets for recycling these materials we and other recyclers are working to educate and remind customers of the need for end market demand and economic viability to support sustainable recycling programs with increased focus on responsible management of plastics our procurement team has taken a proactive approach to ensure environmental sustainability goals are prioritized in managing the products we buy

regulation of oil and gas exploration production and disposal

our ees business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and these disposal services include use of underground injection wells there is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals there also remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production including ghg emissions or hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costprohibitive for our ees customers to continue operations adversely affecting our business

additionally any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations including through use of injection wells could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services conversely any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely affect our business as we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services

investment in natural gas vehicles and infrastructure

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in the us and canada as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles additional regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business

there is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavyduty truck industry and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology such as electric powered vehicles rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles this is resulting in a reduction in tax incentives and grants for natural gas trucks although current options for heavyduty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations we proactively engage in pilots of electric powered heavy duty vehicles and anticipate that we could redirect future planned capital investments in our fleet toward these assets when the vehicles prove economically and operationally viable should regulation mandate an accelerated transition to electric powered vehicles our cost to acquire vehicles needed to service 

our customers could increase capital investment required to establish sufficient charging infrastructure could be significant and investments we have made in an industryleading natural gas fleet and infrastructure could be impaired

renewable fuel production

we have invested and continue to invest in facilities to capture and treat renewable natural gas “rng” from the company’s landfills and rng from landfill and dairy biogas is a significant source of fuel for our natural gas collection vehicles the energy policy act of 2005 and energy independence and security act of 2007 authorize the renewable fuels standards “rfs” program that promotes the production and use of renewable transportation fuels the company is an eparegistered producer of transportation fuel making compressed and liquefied rng from landfill biogas which qualifies as a cellulosic biofuel under the rfs program oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of various categories of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as renewable identification numbers “rins” from renewable fuel producers market uncertainty related to the epa’s implementation of the rfs program led to volatility and a decline in the price of rins between 2017 and 2020 rin prices rebounded in 2020 in response to a court ruling limiting the number of small refinery exemptions that the epa could grant to renewable fuel obligations and later following the november 2020 federal elections on the belief that the newly elected presidential administration would result in stronger enforcement of mandates for rng and other advanced and conventional biofuels 

federal state and local climate change initiatives sustainability

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity 

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events

​ 

consistent with our company’s longstanding commitment to corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship we have published our 2020 sustainability report which details the ghg emissions reductions we have facilitated to date and our determination to expand these reductions in the future as well as our commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe resilient and sustainable our 2020 sustainability report can be found at httpssustainabilitywmcom but it does not constitute a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k the company actively participates in a number of sustainability reporting programs and frameworks including the dow jones sustainability indices where we are “sector leader” for commercial services the cdp where we are among “a list” companies and the sustainability accounting standards board on which we serve as a member of the board’s advisory group

 item 1a risk factors 

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements regarding

 

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2021 and beyond and could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company in addition to the following risks there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known or are not currently believed to be material

strategy and operational risks 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 1 business for more information on our business strategy

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following



 

in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by other factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses subcontractor costs and availability and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all

we may not realize the strategic benefits and cost synergies that are anticipated from our acquisition of advanced disposal services inc “advanced disposal” and we may encounter difficulties integrating advanced disposal’s operations and systems that could impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

the benefits that are expected to result from our acquisition of advanced disposal will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate advanced disposal’s operations and systems and realize anticipated cost synergies there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition of this size the process of integrating operations could cause business interruption and distraction some members of our management may be required to devote considerable time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer the acquisition of advanced disposal may not result in realization of the benefits and cost synergies that we currently expect and we cannot guarantee that these benefits and cost synergies will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all additionally we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the ongoing integration of advanced disposal which may exceed expectations and offset certain benefits

as described further in item 9a controls and procedures  in accordance with sec staff guidance we have excluded advanced disposal from the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 contained in this annual report on form 10k however this exclusion may not extend beyond one year from the october 30 2020 closing date we are in the process of integrating advanced disposal’s operations and systems to ensure the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for this acquired business establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff and the time and expenditures needed may exceed our expectations if we encounter difficulties integrating advanced disposal operations and systems into our system of internal control over financial reporting and if we are unable to correct any issues encountered in a timely manner our ability to record process summarize and report financial data may be adversely affected which may impact the accuracy 

quality and completeness of our financial statements such failure could materially and adversely impact our business and subject us to potential investigations liability and penalties additionally if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence and suffer an adverse effect on our stock price

our operations must comply with extensive existing regulations and changes in regulations andor enforcement of regulations can restrict or alter our operations increase our operating costs increase our tax rate or require us to make additional capital expenditures

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the us and canada have a substantial impact on our operations and compliance with such regulations is costly many complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions restrict our operations at times and may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as

 

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills require us at times to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently we have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills and we establish accruals for these estimated costs expenditures could be accelerated or materially exceed our accruals due to the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or thirdparty landfill operators environmental regulatory changes new information about waste types previously collected such as pfas or other emerging contaminates and other reasons

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however federal state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations for packaging including traditional recyclables such as cardboard bottles and cans if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the regulatory environment in which we operate is influenced by changes in leadership at the federal state provincial and local levels the policies set forth under the previous us administration for example included substantial changes to foreign trade policy and generally were in favor of reducing regulation and corporate taxation while it is anticipated that the new administration will reverse course on various regulatory policies impacting our company we cannot predict what impact the change in administrations will have on specific regulations nor can we predict the timing of any such changes it is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills transfer stations mrfs and other disposal facilities involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures additionally we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability releases of hazardous materials and odors that are sometimes triggered by weather or natural disasters there are also risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate landfill gas and odors we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage and property damage or destruction

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training compliance and response and recovery programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand additionally a major operational failure even if suffered by a competitor may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry with a corresponding increase in operating expense

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subjected or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage states and municipalities are also increasingly adopting requirements for environmental justice reviews as part of certain permitting decisions these policies generally require permitting agencies to give heightened attention to the potential for projects to disproportionately impact lowincome and minority communities responding to permit challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key team members and a highquality workforce or if our succession planning does not develop an adequate pipeline of future leaders it could disrupt our business jeopardize our strategic priorities and result in increased costs negatively impacting our results of operations

our operations require us to attract hire develop and retain a highquality workforce to provide a superior customer experience this includes key individuals in leadership and specialty roles as well as a very large number of drivers 

technicians and other frontline and backoffice team members necessary to provide our environmental services we experience significant competition to hire and retain individuals for certain frontline positions such as commercial truck drivers from within and outside our industry additionally the market for employees that serve on our digital team is highly competitive as we have accelerated our investments in our digital platform it is increasingly important that we are able to attract and retain employees with the skills and expertise necessary to implement and manage our technologyled strategy we also compete to attract skilled business leaders and our own key team members are sought after by our competitors and other companies we make significant investments and engage in extensive internal succession planning to provide us with a robust pipeline of future leaders if we are not able to attract hire develop and retain a highquality workforce with the necessary skills and expertise as well as key leaders or if we experience significant employee turnover it can result in business and strategic disruption increased costs and loss of institutional knowledge which could negatively impact our results of operations 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand

we have made significant investments in an extensive natural gas truck fleet which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices and requirements to transition to other vehicle types could impair these investments

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet however natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in the us and canada as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program

there is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavyduty truck industry and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology such as electric powered vehicles rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles this is resulting in a reduction in tax incentives and grants for natural gas trucks although current options for heavyduty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations we proactively engage in pilots of electric powered heavy duty vehicles and anticipate that we could redirect future planned capital investments in our fleet toward these assets when the vehicles prove economically and operationally viable should regulation mandate an accelerated transition to electric powered vehicles our cost to acquire vehicles needed to service our customers could increase capital investment required to establish sufficient charging infrastructure could be significant and investments we have made in an industryleading natural gas fleet and infrastructure could be impaired

increases in our labor costs as a result of labor unions organizing changes in regulations related to labor unions or increases in employee minimum wages could adversely affect our future results

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining 

agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful would enhance organized labor’s leverage to obtain higher than expected wage and benefits costs and resist the introduction of new technology and other initiatives which can result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes additionally a large portion of our workforce are hourly personnel and many of these individuals particularly in our recycling business are paid at rates related to federal and state minimum wages increases in minimum wage rates or the enactment of new wagerelated legislation may significantly increase our labor costs any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events resulting from climate change and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results of the areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time due to significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results

external economic and industry risks 

the covid19 global pandemic has caused a significant disruption in social and commercial activity throughout north america and the continuation of the covid19 pandemic or other similar pandemic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

during 2020 and continuing into 2021 federal state and local governments throughout north america have imposed varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of covid19 the pandemic and related measures have had a significant adverse impact on many sectors of the economy including environmental services the resulting business closures increases in unemployment and loss of consumer financial stability and confidence has resulted in volume declines and reductions in customers’ waste service needs which has negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows

we have incurred costs related to health safety and financial security of our workforce during the covid19 pandemic this included transitioning backoffice employees to workfromhome and providing financial certainty to employees by guaranteeing all fulltime hourly employees compensation for a 40hour work week regardless of service decreases and reduced work schedules that resulted from the covid19 pandemic it could be necessary for us to incur additional such costs in the future related to pandemic conditions if a large portion of our employee base were to become ill it could impact our ability to provide timely and reliable service additionally the transition of most of our backoffice employees to workfromhome increases various operational risks including potential exposure to cyber incidents loss of data fraud internal control challenges and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing company systems and information remotely in the course of their ordinary work

a broadbased economic slowdown resulting from prolonged negative effects of covid19 could have significant adverse consequences for the financial condition of our customers or suppliers as a result customers may seek to reduce service levels or terminate our contracts or they may be unable to timely pay outstanding receivables owed to us each of which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally such factors have made it more challenging to implement our pricing strategy and are likely to negatively impact our ability to negotiate renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins volume changes can fluctuate dramatically by line of business and decreases in volumes in higher margin businesses such as what we have seen with covid19 can impact key financial metrics additionally as stayathome orders and work from home trends continue the costs to service our residential customers could continue to negatively impact our margins to the extent our suppliers experience a deterioration in financial condition or operational capability as a result of the impacts of covid19 we may experience material supply chain disruptions and delays which could also increase our operating costs

we are not able to estimate the full impact of covid19 on our business but we expect that this situation will continue to have an adverse impact on the economy in general and on the company’s results of operations until a substantial portion of the us population is vaccinated and social distancing restrictions are lifted should these or similar pandemicrelated conditions persist for a prolonged period it may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and hinder our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategy

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices and commodity prices for recyclable materials are particularly susceptible to volatility based on regulations and tariffs that affect our ability to export products

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2017 the chinese government announced bans on certain scrap materials and begun to enforce extremely restrictive quality and other requirements which significantly reduced china’s import of recyclables as of january 1 2021 china ceased importing virtually all recyclables including those exported by us many other markets both domestic and foreign have also tightened their quality expectations and limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables as an example on january 1 2021 new restrictions on the trade of most plastics went into effect as part of the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal the us is not a party to the basel convention but most countries to which we export are which may limit exports of certain plastics

such trade restrictions have disrupted the global trade of recyclables particularly fiber creating excess supply and decreasing recyclable commodity prices we have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycling commodities but there may not be demand for all of the material we produce the heightened quality requirements have been difficult for the industry to achieve and have driven up operating costs in particular singlestream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased 

processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards as recyclable commodity prices have fallen and operating costs have increased we and other recyclers are passing cost increases through to customers the resulting price increase for recycling services in communities and at businesses in the us has resulted in some customers reducing or eliminating their recycling service covid19 placed additional financial stress on municipalities resulting in recycling programs being paused or eliminated when combined with the impacts of the global markets shifts caused by china’s termination of imports the most recent financial stress has led to a number of states considering epr regulations

reductions in market prices for recycling commodities and reduction in demand for recycling commodities and recycling services negatively impacted our operating income and cash flows in 2019 the decline in market prices in 2019 for recycling commodities resulted in a decrease in revenue of 248 million in 2020 we saw a modest recovery in commodity prices due in part to an increased demand for recycled materials resulting in increased revenue of 75 million as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations additionally future regulation tariffs international trade policies or initiatives may result in further reduced demand or increased operating costs which would cause the profitability of our recycling operations to decline

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products significant variations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in a corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our ees business demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices such as the low prices throughout the last few years any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and bans on certain types of waste could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of the us and canada’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills providing services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives

with a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities and states across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use the most common materials banned include plastic straws polystyrene plastic and single use packaging these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials however there are currently no viable end markets for recycling these materials and inclusion of such materials in our recycling stream increases contamination and operating costs and can negatively affect the results of our recycling operations

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect revenues for environmental services and our income from operations margins

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in 

decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which negatively impacts the ability to grow through new business or service upgrades and may result in customer turnover and reduction in customers’ waste service needs consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may also reduce the number and variety of services requested by customers additionally a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows 

a decrease in waste volumes generated results in an increase in competitive pricing pressure such economic conditions may also interfere with our ability to implement our pricing strategy many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase more than the increase if any in the consumer price index this is partially due to our relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels and vendor costs and may not correlate with the consumer price index or the waste industry

weakness in the economy may expose us to credit risk of governmental entities and municipalities and other major customers which could negatively impact our financial results

we provide service to a number of governmental entities municipalities and large national accounts during periods of economic weakness governmental entities and municipalities can suffer significant financial difficulties due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures during these periods such entities and our nongovernmental customers could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates

purchasers of our recycling commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2020 we had 12 billion of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis if market dynamics resulted in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we would incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows

the company’s effective tax rate and tax liability could materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors

predominantly all of the company’s revenues are generated in the us and changes in us tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate financial condition and results of operations the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 the “tax act” had a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax expenses and net deferred tax liabilities the tax act reduced the us corporate statutory tax rate and eliminated or limited the deduction of several expenses that were previously deductible among other things the results of the 2020 us federal elections could lead to further changes in tax laws that would negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate the new presidential administration has provided information on what tax law changes it is likely to support including increasing the us corporate statutory tax rate if ultimately enacted into law this could materially impact our tax provision cash tax liability and effective tax rate

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally if fuel prices 

increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally lawsuits have challenged our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins

technology and information security risks 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that innovate our operations improve the customer experience and provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste in 2020 we are continuing our multiyear commitment to strategic investments in technology including accelerated investments in customer service digitalization research development and implementation of enhanced technology often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or implementation of technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on these investments further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected cost savings or other benefits additionally any system failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations

we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations 

we are in the process of a complex multiyear implementation of a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system the erp system implementation requires the integration of the new erp system with multiple new and existing information systems and business processes and is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information to our management team important to the operation of the business such an implementation is a major 

undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective the implementation of the erp system may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and it is possible that the system will not yield the benefits anticipated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations resulting in negative impacts on our business and operations and subject us to potential liability additionally our implementation of the erp system involves greater utilization of thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations problems faced by us or our thirdparty providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers vendors and employees and expose us to increased liability

substantially all aspects of our business operations rely on digital technology we use computers mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees and our customers these uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber intrusions and we must commit substantial resources to continuously monitor and further develop our networks and infrastructure to prevent detect and address the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events our security programs and measures do not prevent all intrusions cyber intrusions require a significant amount of time and effort to assess and remedy and our incident response efforts may not be effective in all cases the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption direct financial loss negative publicity brand damage alleged violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential regulatory enforcement or private litigation liability and competitive disadvantage while we do maintain insurance for cyber incidents due to policy terms limits and exclusions it may not apply in all cases and it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities incurred

further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions including our recent acquisition of advanced disposal and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk certain new technologies such as use of autonomous vehicles remotecontrolled equipment and virtual reality present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection issues and expanding laws could negatively impact our business subject us to criticism and expose us to increased liability 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future we collect certain personally identifiable information and other sensitive information as integral parts of our business and in connection with providing services to our customers we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern the collection and use of such information obtained from individuals and businesses these laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving interpretations government officials regulators privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data we must continually monitor the development and adoption of new and emerging laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” that took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that can expand the scope of our potential liability we must commit substantial time and resources toward compliance with 

the ccpa and similar laws and regulations any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newly acquired companies could subject us to regulatory enforcement private litigation public criticism disrupt our operations cause us to lose customers result in additional costs and legal liability damage our reputation and otherwise harm our business

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if it is alleged that our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved and for conditions resulting from waste types or compounds previously considered nonhazardous but later determined to present possible threat to public health or the environment the risks of successor liability and emerging contaminants are of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which governmental entities private groups or individuals seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage or violation of statutes or desire to revoke or deny permits required for our operations we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant

changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas exploration production and disposal could adversely affect our ees business

our ees business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and these disposal services include the use of underground injection wells demand for these services is adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to regulation and industry conditions beyond our control in addition to changes in oil and gas prices there is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals there also remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production including ghg emissions or hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costprohibitive for our ees customers to continue operations adversely affecting our business 

additionally any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations including through the use of injection wells could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services conversely any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely impact demand for our ees services

changes to federal and state renewable fuel policies could affect our financial performance in that sector as a renewable fuel producer 

the primary drivers of renewable fuel development at our landfills are federal and state incentive programs such as the federal rfs program and the california low carbon fuel standard at the federal level oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as rins from renewable fuel producers the company has invested and continues to invest in facilities that capture and convert landfill gas into renewable natural gas so that we can participate in the program the value of the rins associated with our landfill gas is set through a market established by the program each year the epa is required to finalize a rule establishing refiners’ obligations to purchase renewable natural gas and other cellulosic biofuels under the rfs program market uncertainty stemming from these annual rulemakings as well as the epa’s administration of other aspects of the rfs program led to a rapid decline in rin values in 2019 and much of 2020 before rebounding in november 2020 we will continue to advocate for the new administration to implement policies that ensure longterm stability for renewable transportation fuels as changes in the rfs market or the structure of the rfs program can and has reduced the value of renewable natural gas rins and negatively impacted the financial performance of the facilities constructed to capture and treat the gas

the impact of climate change and the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our costs to operate

we continue to assess the physical risks to our operations from the effects of climate change although we have made investments to mitigate risk associated with severe storm events damage to our facilities or disruption of service caused by more frequent or more severe storms associated with climate extremes could negatively impact operating results we have also identified risk to our assets and our employees associated with drought or water scarcity flooding extreme heat and rain events and fire conditions associated with climate change for example wildfires influenced by climate change can damage landfill infrastructure such as gas collection systems flooding in lowlying areas enhanced by sea level rise can result in greater maintenance expenses at our facilities and service disruption and more frequent or extreme rain events can erode the protective vegetative caps on our landfills and generate increased volumes of leachate to manage those areas of the country most prone to these occurrences have protocols in place or are developing protocols to address these conditions including employee safety driver training and equipment and facility protection protocols we have incurred and will incur costs to develop and implement these protocols and these protocols may not be effective in offsetting these risks additionally the actions of others in response to climate change effects such as the rolling power blackouts implemented in california in 2019 due to wildfire risks can result in service disruptions and increase our costs to operate

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state provincial regional and federal levels to cap andor curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change we continue to monitor these efforts and the potential impacts to our operations should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v ghg tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however future ghg regulations may require landfill gas emission quantification andor emission reduction requirements beyond what is currently required and such amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with us or foreign laws or regulations

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices 

or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements

from time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business we are also party to civil litigation as a large company with operations across the us and canada we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business actions that have been filed against us and that may be filed against us in the future include personal injury property damage commercial customer and employmentrelated claims including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to

 

the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity

financial risks 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile and several other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by thirdparty rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected

additionally we have 31 billion of debt as of december 31 2020 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the impact of our commercial paper borrowings and taxexempt bonds if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow

we may use our 35 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in november 2024 as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility we had 270 million of letters of credit issued and 18 billion of outstanding borrowings net of related discount on issuance under our commercial paper program both supported by this facility leaving unused and available credit capacity of 14 billion as of december 31 2020 in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due

we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that have in the past and may in the future lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we have in the past and may in the future be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans “multiemployer pension plans” for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal depending on various factors including potential legislative changes future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period and our ongoing costs of participation in multiemployer pension plans may increase see notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans

overview

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services providing services throughout the united states “us” and canada we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy we own or operate the largest network of landfills in the us and canada in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity additionally we are a leading recycler in the us and canada handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the us consistent with our company’s longstanding commitment to corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship we have published our 2020 sustainability report which details our commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe resilient and sustainable the information in this report can be found at httpssustainabilitywmcom but does not constitute a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k for further discussion see section “federal state and local climate change initiatives sustainability” in item 1

our solid waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental fee fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business described under results of operations below

acquisition of advanced disposal services inc “advanced disposal” 

on october 30 2020 we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of advanced disposal for 3030 per share in cash pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated april 14 2019 as amended on june 24 2020 total enterprise value of the acquisition was 46 billion when including approximately 18 billion of advanced disposal’s net debt this acquisition grows our footprint and allows us to provide differentiated sustainable waste management and recycling services to approximately three million new commercial industrial and residential customers primarily located in the eastern half of the us the acquisition was funded using our 30 billion 364day us revolving credit facility “364day revolving credit facility” and our commercial paper program as discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the acquisition we recorded 41 billion of net assets including 25 billion of goodwill

immediately following the closing of the advanced disposal acquisition the transactions contemplated by the us department of justice in connection with our acquisition of advanced disposal as subsequently amended the “divestiture agreement” were consummated the required divestitures included a combination of assets and businesses belonging to us and advanced disposal the company subsequently received cash proceeds from the sale of 856 million subject to certain postclosing adjustments we recognized a net gain of 33 million on our net assets divested in this transaction primarily within our tier 2 segment the impact on our results of operations from the divestitures was not material for the year ended december 31 2020

for the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred 156 million of acquisition and integration related costs which are primarily classified as “selling general and administrative expenses” the postclosing operating results of advanced disposal have been included in our consolidated financial statements within our existing reportable segments since the acquisition date advanced disposal has recognized 205 million 142 million and 60 million of revenue operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses respectively which are included in our consolidated statement of operations

covid19 update 

in january 2020 a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was declared a public health emergency of international concern and was subsequently declared a global pandemic in march 2020 we have contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of operations at our collection sites transfer stations landfills and recycling facilities these plans ensure that we are in compliance with federal state provincial and local guidelines key elements of our business continuity plan have been executed consistently across the organization our safety team has medical experts and industrial hygienists that are continuously monitoring and incorporating guidance from relevant authorities to date our existing personal protective equipment hygiene and operating procedures comply with guidelines established to protect our employees from additional risks associated with covid19

covid19 began to impact our business in midmarch 2020 the results of which are described in detail under results of operations below the challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic on the global economy increased rapidly at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and have continued through the date of this report impacting our business in most geographies and across a variety of our customer types waste management provides essential services to a diverse customer base and as a result many elements of our business are less exposed to variability however steps taken by national and local governments to slow the spread of the virus including travel bans prohibitions on group events and gatherings shutdowns of certain businesses curfews stayathome orders and recommendations to practice social distancing resulted in revenue declines at our landfills as well as decreased demand from our industrial and commercial collection customers additionally within the residential line of business the cost to service our customers increased as stayathome orders and continuing workfromhome trends increased the waste we collect while we have seen improvement in our landfill and industrial and commercial collection volumes from the lowest levels observed in april 2020 uncertainty continues in the pace of business and economic recovery as national and local governments respond to guidance from relevant authorities in response to changes in covid19 statistics within local jurisdictions

the company has proactively taken steps to put our employees’ and customers’ needs first and we continue to work with the appropriate regulatory agencies to ensure we can provide our essential services safely and efficiently these 

efforts are in some instances reducing shortterm revenues or increasing our costs though they are sound decisions that reflect our focus on the longterm strength of our business examples of these efforts include

employees — we have prioritized the health safety and financial security of our workforce as local government bodies began to implement stayathome orders and as business closures became more prevalent during the first half of 2020 key steps taken to benefit our workforce included i transitioning backoffice employees to workfromhome ii providing financial certainty to employees by temporarily guaranteeing all fulltime hourly employees’ compensation for a 40 hour work week regardless of covid19 related service decreases iii securing additional personal protective equipment to bolster the safety and security of our workplaces and iv guaranteeing elements of incentive compensation to certain employees to reflect our appreciation for their dedication and focus on executing well in the face of the pandemic we continue to monitor covid19 and remain committed to keeping our employees safe by following federal and local laws and regulations

customers — our top priority with respect to our customers has been ensuring that essential waste service needs continue to be safely met despite the unprecedented changes encountered in their communities during the initial months of the pandemic we worked with customers impacted by the covid19 pandemic to waive and suspend certain ancillary service charges defer certain annual price increases extend payment terms adjust customer service levels and provide qualifying small and medium businesses with one month of free service upon reopening beginning in july with communities and governments reopening social distancing and safety measures being adopted and signs of an improving economy we resumed fees and price increases in accordance with our contractual terms and our average yield improved as expected

the above steps combined with our disciplined execution in our daily operations have positioned the company to prudently manage the challenges presented by the covid19 pandemic the fundamentals of the company continue to remain strong and we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this volatile period 

we attribute the following notable impacts on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 to the covid19 pandemic

revenues — during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced a negative impact to revenue that we attribute to reductions in customers’ waste service needs as a result of covid19 while it is very difficult to measure we believe that the covid19related revenue loss was approximately 890 million while the customercentric steps discussed above have also contributed to this revenue decline these impacts have been relatively immaterial to the overall revenue decline as mentioned above our volumes particularly in our landfill and industrial and commercial collection lines of businesses have improved from the lows experienced in april 2020 though the pace of volume recovery moderated during the fourth quarter of 2020 as local governments responded to recommendations from applicable authorities and changes in the covid19 statistics

operating expenses — volumedriven revenue declines and our strategic focus on proactive cost management led to a significant reduction in certain variable operating expenses these reductions have been most significant in labor costs where we have focused on developing an optimal work week that reduces overtime hours and maintenance and repairs the revenue declines due to the covid19 pandemic have had a greater impact on our higher margin business lines and have negatively impacted our operating costs as a percentage of revenues additionally our operating expenses have been impacted by employee pay guarantees and increases in container weights in our residential collection line of business which increased our overall cost to serve these customers despite this our proactive cost management efforts positioned us to hold our overall operating expenses as a percentage of revenues flat when compared with the prior year period

selling general and administrative expenses — covid19 impacts on our customers and related customer receipts has led to an increase in the provision for bad debts for the year ended december 31 2020 however during the second half of 2020 we began to see an improvement in the provision for bad debts driven by successful collection efforts additionally during 2020 we incurred costs associated with transitioning backoffice employees to a workfromhome environment and costs related to employee pay guarantees

the ultimate impacts of covid19 on our longterm outlook for the business will depend on future developments including the duration of the pandemic and pace of economic recovery these factors and their impacts on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time we remain focused on the diligent and safe execution of our daily operations additionally we are focused on ensuring that we emerge from this pandemic a stronger more differentiated company positioned as the service provider of choice for the longterm

business environment 

the waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry however customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills we monitor these developments to adapt our services offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we promote our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs

despite some industry consolidation in recent years we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private service providers based on pricing service quality customer experience and breadth of service offerings our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors including increases and decreases in consumer spending business expansions and construction activity these factors generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and impact our revenue negative economic conditions including the impact of covid19 can and have caused customers to reduce their service needs such negative economic conditions in addition to competitor actions can and have made it more challenging to implement our pricing strategy and negotiate renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins we also encounter competition for acquisitions and growth opportunities general economic factors and the market for consumer goods in addition to regulatory developments can also significantly impact commodity prices for the recyclable materials we sell significant components of our operating expenses vary in correlation to changes in revenue due to volume volume changes can fluctuate dramatically by line of business and decreases in volumes in higher margin businesses such as what we have seen with covid19 can impact key financial metrics in this type of environment we must dynamically manage our cost structure

our financial results for the year ended december 31 2020 reflect declines in our collection and disposal lines of business as a result of the negative impacts of covid19 these impacts began in march 2020 and continued through the date of this report although we began to experience improvement in volumes during the second half of 2020 when compared to the more acute impacts we experienced earlier in the year given the ongoing pressures on the business from covid19 we continue to take proactive steps to reduce costs and maximize cash flow these steps include i optimizing our route structure to respond proactively to lower industrial and commercial collection volumes ii limiting hiring and optimizing the existing workforce through improved retention and reduced turnover and iii reducing or eliminating certain nonessential costs and expenses like travel and entertainment additionally to enhance our liquidity we are maintaining a disciplined focus on capital management by aligning additional investments with the revenue generation of the business reducing capital spending on our landfill assets and managing container capital in conjunction with our customers’ volumes we also elected to temporarily suspend additional share repurchases in 2020 after the first quarter

covid19 has also had impacts on the recycling line of business including the creation of a shortterm dislocation in the supply and demand dynamics for recycled commodities in the us which increased market prices for certain commodities despite this increase in market prices we continue to invest and seek opportunities for cost improvement as we remain steadfast in our commitment to improve the profitability and returns of the recycling line of business in any economic environment we have maintained our focus on converting to a feebased pricing model that addresses the cost of processing materials and the impact on our cost structure to manage contamination in the recycling stream

we believe that the company’s industryleading asset network and strategic focuses on investing in people and our digital platform will give the company the necessary tools to address the challenges presented by the covid19 pandemic and the impacts on our industry in line with our commitment to continuous improvement and a differentiated customer experience we continue to accelerate our customer service digitalization initiative to change the way we interact with our customers enhancements made through this initiative are designed to seamlessly and digitally connect all of the company’s functions necessary to provide our customers the best experience and service 

current year financial results 

during 2020 we delivered solid operating income and cash flows despite revenue declines in our collection and disposal lines of business due to the covid19 pandemic we continue to take intentional steps to decrease our operating costs and eliminate discretionary selling general and administrative expenses to mitigate the impact from the declines in our volumes in addition to our focus on reducing certain costs we took proactive steps to manage our capital spending the company continued its commitment to supporting both organic and inorganic growth during 2020 with the highlight being the completion of our acquisition of advanced disposal in total the company allocated 1632 million of available cash to capital expenditures and funded 4088 million of acquisitions of solid waste businesses we also allocated 1329 million of available cash to our shareholders during 2020 through dividends and common stock repurchases

key elements of our 2020 financial results include

 

 

 

results of operations

operating revenues

our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business including both our wmsbs and ees businesses recycling brokerage services landfill gastoenergy services and certain other expanded service offerings and solutions the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the year ended december 31 in millions

 

 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues and average yield for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions

 

 

the following provides further details about our periodtoperiod change in revenues

average yield

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer and landfill operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee fluctuations but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to the types of services provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers

the details of our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield are as follows dollars in millions

 ​ 

our overall strategic pricing efforts that are focused on improving our average unit rate have proven to be effective despite the covid19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020 in order to support the continuity of our customers’ 

businesses we made certain customercentric pricing decisions such as temporarily waiving and suspending certain ancillary service charges as well as delaying price increases in certain markets these actions negatively impacted our yeartodate average yield however beginning in july 2020 we resumed fees and price increases in accordance with contractual terms and our average yield rebounded as expected

recycling commodities — increases in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in revenue growth of 75 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared with prior year decreases in the market prices for recycling commodities in 2019 resulted in a revenue decline of 248 million as compared to 2018 average market prices for recycling commodities at the company’s facilities were 19 higher in 2020 compared to 2019 and 35 lower in 2019 compared to 2018 we saw a market price increase in 2020 driven by a shortterm dislocation in supply and demand dynamics for recycled materials largely due to covid19 related decreases in the supply of recycled materials while average market prices in 2020 were higher than 2019 we were at or below our overall historical average market price by the end of 2020 we continue to invest and seek opportunities for cost improvement as we remain steadfast in our commitment to improve the profitability and returns of the recycling line of business in any economic environment we have maintained our focus on converting to a feebased pricing model that addresses the cost of processing materials and the impact on our cost structure to manage contamination in the recycling stream

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these fees which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program declined 151 million and 22 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively as compared with the prior year periods these revenues are based on and fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel given the downturn in oil and gas markets market prices for diesel fuel decreased approximately 16 and 4 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively compared with the prior year periods additionally we transitioned certain customers’ pricing away from a fuel surcharge reflecting the cost of fuel in the base rates we charge for our services which further contributed to the yearoveryear decline 

the mandated fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these amounts have not significantly impacted the change in revenue for the periods presented

volume

our revenues from volume excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures decreased 692 million or 45 and increased 346 million or 23 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively as compared with the prior year periods

beginning in march 2020 and continuing throughout the date of this report our industrial and commercial collection and landfill businesses experienced significant volume declines as a result of the covid19 pandemic while we have seen some improvement in our landfill and industrial and commercial collection volumes from the lowest levels observed in april 2020 our volumes continue to be meaningfully below prior year particularly in special waste at the landfill projectdriven work in the industrial collection business and certain commercial and collection customer segments uncertainty continues with respect to the pace of business and economic recovery as local governments continue to respond to recommendations from applicable authorities and changes in the covid19 statistics additionally while natural disaster cleanup efforts benefited our 2019 volumes they were inconsequential to our results for the year ended december 31 2020 the preceding decreases in volumerelated revenues have been partially offset by volume increases in our wm renewable energy business which grew in 2020 as a result of a new renewable energy facility coming online and our continued focus on a differentiated service model for national accounts customers

we experienced higher volumes throughout 2019 when compared to 2018 due to our focus on customer service and disciplined growth combined with favorable market conditions in our collection and disposal business we experienced significant volume growth with existing customers particularly in our commercial collection business as a result of proactive efforts taken to work with our customers as their needs expanded to identify service upgrade opportunities our eventdriven projects in our special waste business and growth in our municipal solid waste business contributed to our landfill volume growth in 2019 furthermore our wmsbs business experienced favorable volume growth in 2019 the 

cleanup efforts of natural disasters primarily in california during the first half of 2019 contributed to volume growth in 2019 partially offset by volume decline from our recycling brokerage services in 2019 

operating expenses

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits costs excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business including certain rebates paid to suppliers vi fuel costs net of tax credits for alternative fuel which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and x other operating costs which include gains and losses on sale of assets telecommunications equipment and facility lease expenses property taxes utilities and supplies variations in volumes yearoveryear as discussed above in operating revenues  in addition to cost inflation affect the comparability of the components of our operating expenses

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

as discussed above in operating revenues  yearoveryear decreases in our landfill and industrial and commercial collection volumes primarily due to the impacts of covid19 have significantly impacted the year ended december 31 2020 the declines in most operating expense categories during the reported periods are directly related to proactive steps taken to manage our variable costs in the lower volume environment the revenue declines due to the covid19 pandemic have had a greater impact on our higher margin business lines and have negatively impacted operating costs as a percentage of revenues in addition our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was impacted by our acquisition of advanced disposal as the acquired business’s operating cost structure is higher than ours because we are early in our integration and synergy realization processes and we have incurred certain onetime upfront costs 

needed to support integration despite this our proactive cost management efforts positioned us to hold our overall operating expenses as a percentage of revenues flat when compared with the prior year periods

significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely driven by decreases in volume in our industrial and commercial collection businesses our proactive steps positioned us to optimize our route structure to respond to lower industrial and commercial collection volumes additionally the decrease was attributable to i improved efficiency ii lower headcount due to employee attrition coupled with proactive steps to defer hiring due to covid19 driven uncertainty and iii lower annual incentive compensation these decreases were offset in part by annual merit increases and the addition of employees as a result of our acquisition of advanced disposal the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was driven by i volume growth in our collection and disposal business ii merit increases and iii cost inflation these cost increases were offset in part by lower bonus costs related to a onetime plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention 

transfer and disposal costs  — the decrease in transfer and disposal costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely driven by volume declines in our industrial and commercial collection businesses as a result of covid19 offset in part by additional disposal costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal the increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was driven by overall volume growth in our collection and disposal business and to a lesser extent cost inflation

maintenance and repairs  — the decrease in maintenance and repairs costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely driven by proactive steps to optimize routes and reduce overtime hours to address the volume declines discussed above this decline in costs was partially offset by additional costs incurred to make investments in the fleet acquired as part of the advanced disposal acquisition additionally there has been an increasing trend in our maintenance and repairs costs during the reported periods due to i inflationary cost pressures for both company and thirdparty services due to demand for skilled technician labor as well as for parts and supplies ii higher per unit costs required for an increasingly automated fleet in the residential line of business and iii our focus on making upgrades to our operating facilities the comparisons are also impacted by a 16 million noncash charge to write off certain equipment costs related to our other segment recognized in 2019

subcontractor costs  — the decrease in subcontractor costs in 2020 as compared to 2019 was largely driven by covid19 related volume declines in our industrial collection business and projects ending or scaling down during 2020 in our ees business the decrease was offset in part by an increase in business activity in our wmsbs business which relies more extensively on subcontracted hauling than our collection and disposal business the increase in subcontractor costs in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by i volume growth in our collection and disposal business largely attributable to a significant contract executed in the second half of 2017 that generated incremental volumes in 2019 ii volume growth in our wmsbs and ees businesses and iii cost inflation related to capacity constraints of our subcontractors in certain markets 

cost of goods sold — costs in 2020 were flat when compared to 2019 in spite of an increase in commodity prices largely due to lower recycling volumes as a result of covid19 additionally a higher percentage of our overall recycled commodity sales were targeted at domestic markets resulting in lower freight costs the decrease in cost of goods sold in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily driven by lower market prices for recycling commodities and by lower costs due to the sale of certain ancillary operations in the second quarter of 2018

fuel — the decrease in fuel costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to i a decline in market prices for diesel fuel ii lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and iii volume declines the decreases were offset in part by i lower federal alternative fuel credits and ii additional costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal the decrease in fuel costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was due to i the recognition of two years of federal alternative fuel credits in 2019 compared to a single year of credits in 2018 due to the 

timing of government action providing for the benefits attributable to each period ii lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and iii lower market prices for diesel fuel 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — the decrease in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily related to lower volumes in our landfill line of business largely driven by the impact of covid19 the decreases were offset in part by additional costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal the increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily related to higher volumes in our landfill line of business 

landfill operating costs — the increase in landfill operating costs in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to higher leachate management costs compared to the prior year and additional costs attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal this increase was offset in part by decreases attributable to lower volumes at our landfills the increase in landfill operating costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to higher leachate management costs driven largely by inclement weather in certain parts of north america and increased ongoing site maintenance costs additionally 2020 and 2019 were impacted by decreases in the riskfree discount rate used in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets due to decreases in us treasury rates see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

risk management  — risk management costs were relatively flat in 2020 as compared with 2019 the increase in risk management costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to an increase in claims expense as a result of growth in the business and cost inflation 

other — net gains on sales of certain assets during each year impacted the comparability of the reported periods

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefits costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising bank charges computer costs travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation reserves generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 have increased due to i incremental costs of approximately 150 million incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of advanced disposal ii strategic investments in our digital platform including planned investments in a new enterprise resource planning system and accelerated investments in customer service digitalization and iii an increase in the provision for bad debts due to negative impacts on customer receipts experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition to the cost increases selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue have increased in 2020 due to the decline in volumerelated revenues 

​ 

we consistently manage our costs particularly those incurred for discretionary initiatives to ensure that we are optimizing our customer service backoffice effectiveness and profitability as a result of the declines in revenue from the covid19 pandemic we specifically focused on reducing costs for advertising travel and entertainment and professional fees other than those specifically tied to strategic initiatives the decreases in selling general and administrative expenses from these proactive steps have been more than offset by the items discussed above

significant items affecting the comparison of our selling general and administrative expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2020 compared with 2019 was largely due to i costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of advanced disposal including severance costs and additional headcount ii annual merit increases and iii costs associated with the strategic investments in our digital platform these cost increases were offset in part by i lower annual incentive compensation and ii proactive steps undertaken to defer hiring and reduce labor related costs the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due to i an increase in headcount merit increases and higher incentive compensation and ii increased contract labor costs driven by planned investments in our digital platform 

professional fees  — the increases in professional fees over the reported periods were primarily driven by consulting fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of advanced disposal and strategic investments in our digital platform 

provision for bad debts  — the increase in the provision for bad debts in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to increased collection risk associated with certain customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic however we were encouraged to see an overall improvement in customer account collections during the second half of 2020 when compared to the first half of the year the decrease in provision for bad debts in 2019 compared with 2018 was due to the collection of certain fully reserved receivables and higher prior year bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of a strategic customer 

other — the decrease in other expenses in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to lower litigation costs and proactive measures taken to reduce discretionary costs such as travel and entertainment companywide these cost decreases were offset in part by increased technology infrastructure costs in 2020 which we expect to continue as we make strategic investments in our digital platform we also incurred onetime technology costs in the first half of 2020 to transition employees to workfromhome in response to the covid19 pandemic the increase in other expenses in 2019 compared with 2018 was principally driven by higher litigation reserves and increased infrastructure costs associated with investments in our digital platform 

depreciation and amortization expenses

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily related to i investments in capital assets including trucks and facilities and ii additional depreciation attributable to our acquisition of advanced disposal the decrease in amortization of landfill airspace in 2020 compared with 2019 was driven by i lower volumes at our landfills primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic and ii a decrease in the inflation rate used to estimate capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations from 25 to 225 at 

december 31 2020 these decreases were offset in part by charges to reflect changes in estimated landfill construction costs and our acquisition of advanced disposal 

our amortization of intangible assets was flat in 2020 compared with 2019 the increased expense for intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of advanced disposal was offset primarily by decreases for certain customer list assets reaching the end of their lives

the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily related to higher capital expenditures due to an intentional focus on accelerating certain fleet and landfill spending to support the company’s strong collection and disposal growth the increase in amortization of landfill airspace in 2019 compared with 2018 was driven by higher volumes at our landfills and changes in landfill estimates

restructuring 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 9 million of restructuring charges primarily related to modifying our field sales and customer services structures to better support our investment in customer service digitalization which is discussed above

gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net

the following table summarizes the major components of gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net for the year ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 35 million of net charges primarily related to the following

gain from divestitures net — as discussed further in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements we and advanced disposal entered into an agreement that provided for gfl environmental to acquire a combination of assets from us and advanced disposal to address divestitures required by the us department of justice immediately following the closing of the advanced disposal acquisition on october 30 2020 the transactions contemplated by the divestiture agreement were consummated and the company subsequently received cash proceeds from the sale of 856 million we recognized a net gain of 33 million on our net assets divested primarily within our tier 2 segment 

energy services asset impairments — during the second quarter of 2020 the company tested the recoverability of certain energy services assets in our tier 1 segment indicators of impairment included i the sharp downturn in oil demand that has led to a significant decline in oil prices and production activities which we project will have longterm impacts on the utilization of our assets and ii significant shifts in our business including increases in competition and customers choosing to bury waste on site versus in a landfill reducing our revenue outlook the company determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not fully recoverable as a result we recognized 41 million of noncash impairment charges primarily related to two landfills and an oil field waste injection facility in our tier 1 segment we wrote down the net book value of these assets to their estimated fair value using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections level 3 the aggregate fair value of the impaired asset group was 8 million as of june 30 2020 the company tested the recoverability of an additional 239 million in energy services assets and determined that the carrying amount was recoverable as of june 30 2020 no new indicators of impairment were identified during the second half of 2020

other impairments —we recognized a 20 million noncash impairment charge in our tier 3 segment due to management’s decision to close a landfill once its constructed airspace is filled and abandon any remaining permitted 

airspace which was considered an impairment indicator we determined the carrying value was not recoverable and we wrote off the entire net book value of the asset using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections level 3 the impairment charge was comprised of 12 million related to the carrying value of the asset and 8 million related to the acceleration of the expected timing of capping closure and postclosure activities which is discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

additionally we recognized 7 million of net charges primarily related to noncash impairments of certain assets within our wm renewable energy business in our other segment we determined the carrying values of the assets were not recoverable and we wrote off their entire net carrying value using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections level 3

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized asset impairments of 42 million related to i 27 million of goodwill impairment charges of which 17 million related to our ees business and 10 million related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit and ii 15 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to certain solid waste operations 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized net gains of 58 million primarily related to i a 52 million gain associated with the sale of certain collection and disposal operations in tier 1 and ii net gains of 44 million substantially all from divestitures of certain ancillary operations these gains were partially offset by i a 30 million charge to impair a landfill in tier 3 based on an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis taking into account continued volume decreases and revised capping cost estimates and ii 8 million of impairment charges primarily related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments 

income from operations

the following table summarizes income from operations for the year ended december 31 and has been updated to reflect our realigned segments which are discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements dollars in millions

 

 percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison



 

solid waste — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three years ended december 31 2020 are summarized below

the following items affected 2020 when compared to 2019

 

the following items affected 2019 when compared to 2018

 

however the following items negatively impacted our results from operations and resulted in lower income from operations in 2019 when compared with 2018 

 

other — income from operations for the other segment for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with 2019 was favorably impacted primarily by i an increase in revenue in our wm renewable energy business as a result of a new renewable energy facility coming online which drove an increase in commodity sales ii an increase in revenue for our wmsbs business as a result of newly executed national account contracts and iii an increase in revenue in our recycling brokerage business

in 2019 compared with 2018 lower income from operations is a result of i net gains from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in the prior year period of 44 million ii 27 million of goodwill impairment charges of which 17 million related to our ees business and 10 million related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit iii lower commodity 

prices in 2019 associated with our wm renewable energy business iv a 16 million noncash charge to write off certain equipment costs in 2019 and v an increase in claims expense as a result of growth in the business and cost inflation 

corporate and other — the most significant items affecting the results of operations for corporate and other during the three years ended december 31 2020 are summarized below

the following items affected 2020 when compared with 2019

 

the following items affected 2019 when compared with 2018

 

interest expense net

our interest expense net was 425 million 411 million and 374 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in interest expense net for 2020 was primarily attributable to decreases in interest income resulting from lower cash and cash equivalents balances due to the redemption of 30 billion of senior notes with a special mandatory redemption feature the “smr notes” in july 2020 as discussed below in loss on early extinguishment of debt net  partially offsetting the decreases in interest income were favorable impacts due to a lower interest rate on our commercial paper borrowings as a result of the favorable interest rate environment in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase in 2019 compared with 2018 is primarily attributable to our may 2019 issuance of 40 billion senior notes partially offset by related increases in interest income as a result of higher cash and cash equivalents balances 

loss on early extinguishment of debt net 

in may 2019 wm issued 40 billion of senior notes including 30 billion of smr notes we used 344 million of the proceeds from this offering to retire 257 million principal amount of certain highcoupon senior notes the cash paid to retire the highcoupon senior notes also included 84 million of related premiums which are classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations and 3 million of accrued interest 

in the third quarter of 2019 we elected to refund and reissue 99 million of taxexempt bonds which resulted in the recognition of a 1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations 

in july 2020 we recognized a 52 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations related to the mandatory redemption of the smr notes the loss includes 30 million of premiums paid and 22 million of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs pursuant to the terms of the smr notes we were required to redeem all of such outstanding notes paying debt holders 101 of the aggregate principal amounts of such notes plus accrued but unpaid interest as a result of the advanced disposal acquisition not being completed by july 14 2020 accordingly the redemption was completed on july 20 2020 using available cash on hand and to a lesser extent 

commercial paper borrowings the cash paid included the 30 billion principal amount of debt redeemed 30 million of related premiums and 8 million of accrued interest 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we repaid the outstanding borrowings under our 364day revolving credit facility and contemporaneously terminated the facility at which time we recognized a 2 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations related to unamortized debt issuance costs

at the time of acquisition advanced disposal had outstanding 425 million of 5625 senior notes due november 2024 in november 2020 we redeemed the notes pursuant to an optional redemption feature upon which we recognized a 1 million gain on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations due to the difference in carrying value and redemption price

​ 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the debt transactions

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities

we recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of 68 million 55 million and 41 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the losses for each period are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties we generate tax benefits including tax credits from the losses incurred from these investments which are discussed further in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements additionally the 2019 periods include losses associated with our investment in a refined coal facility in 2020 the entity that holds and manages our ownership interest in the refined coal facility sold a majority of its assets resulting in a 7 million noncash impairment charge at that time 

other net

we recognized other net income of 5 million and 2 million in 2020 and 2018 respectively compared to other net expense of 50 million in 2019 in 2019 we recognized a 52 million noncash impairment charge related to our minorityowned investment in a waste conversion technology business we wrote down our investment to its estimated fair value as the result of recent thirdparty investor’s transactions in these securities the fair value of our investment was not readily determinable thus we determined the fair value utilizing a combination of quoted price inputs for the equity in our investment level 2 and certain management assumptions pertaining to investment value level 3 

income tax expense

we recorded income tax expense of 397 million 434 million and 453 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively resulting in effective income tax rates of 209 206 and 190 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following



 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis

we owned or operated 263 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2020 and 244 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2019 for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity as measured in tons of waste for the year ended december 31 and remaining airspace measured in cubic yards of waste as of december 31 in millions

 



 

the tons received at our landfills for the year ended december 31 are shown below tons in thousands

 

 

when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our environmental legacy management group as of december 31 2020 our environmental legacy management group managed 221 closed landfills including eight closed landfills acquired from advanced disposal

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2020 and projected annual disposal volume the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 38 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume disposal prices construction and operating costs remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions — landfills section below although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 40 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume

the number of landfills owned or operated as of december 31 2020 segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows

 

 

as of december 31 2020 we have 17 landfills which are not currently accepting waste during the year ended december 31 2020 we performed tests of recoverability for five of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of 304 million for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values we did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining 12 landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was not material

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below

the changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended december 31 2020 are reflected in the table below in millions

 ​ 

as of december 31 2020 we estimate that we will spend approximately 664 million in 2021 and approximately 13 billion in 2022 and 2023 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by 

conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated

the changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended december 31 2020 are reflected in the table below in millions

 

 

landfill operating costs — the following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the year ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

amortization of landfill airspace  — amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses includes the following

 

amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill net of accumulated amortization by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total permitted and expansion airspace final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated permitted and expansion airspace accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis for the year ended december 31

 ​ 

different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 268 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company each year in addition amortization expense for 2020 includes approximately 11 million related to approximately 12 million tons received at landfills acquired as part of our advanced disposal transaction

liquidity and capital resources 

the company consistently generates cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds our working capital needs payment of our dividends and investment in the business through capital expenditures and tuckin acquisitions we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business requirements that may arise during the year additionally the company continually takes actions to manage costs and capital spending without compromising longterm strategic priorities recent actions include route optimization initiatives reducing overtime hours limiting hiring and optimizing our workforce through improved retention and reduced turnover reducing nonessential selling general and administrative expenses and lowering capital expenditures to a level that is consistent with volume changes driven by covid19 the company believes that its investment grade credit ratings large value of unencumbered assets and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital operating strategic and other liquidity requirements 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 in millions

 

 cash and cash equivalents — the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during 2020 is primarily due to funding our acquisition of advanced disposal in october 2020 as discussed above in acquisition of advanced disposal inc 

debt — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our borrowings as of december 31 2020 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

as of december 31 2020 we had 33 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months including i 18 billion of shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program ii 12 billion of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities and iii 242 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months including 127 million of taxexempt bonds as of december 31 2020 we have classified 27 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as longterm because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our 35 billion longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility “35 billion revolving credit facility” as discussed below the remaining 551 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations

as of december 31 2020 we also had 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with longterm scheduled maturities supported by letters of credit under our 35 billion revolving credit facility the interest rates on our variable rate taxexempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process all recent taxexempt bond remarketings have successfully placed company bonds with investors at marketdriven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful however if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we have the availability under our 35 billion revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully accordingly we have classified the 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with maturities of more than one year as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020

in november 2020 wm issued 25 billion of senior notes consisting of

summary of cash flow activity

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

net cash provided by operating activities — our operating cash flows decreased by 471 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared with the prior year period as a result of i higher income tax payments related to a taxable gain on the sale of advanced disposal assets to gfl environmental ii increased interest payments and integration related spending due to our acquisition of advanced disposal iii payments associated with investments we are making in our digital platform and iv to a lesser extent lower earnings on our traditional solid waste business primarily caused by the impact of the covid19 pandemic these results were partially offset by cash benefits in the current year associated with the 2019 federal alternative fuel credits

our operating cash flows increased by 304 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared with the prior year period as a result of i higher earnings in the current year period primarily associated with our collection and disposal business ii lower bonus payments iii lower income tax payments of 57 million and iv net favorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures offset slightly by higher interest payments in the current year period primarily due to our may 2019 issuance of senior notes

net cash used in investing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below

 

net cash used in provided by financing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below

we announced in december 2020 that the board of directors has authorized up to 135 billion in future share repurchases which supersedes and replaces remaining authority under any prior board of directors’ authorization for share repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations

 

in december 2020 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0545 to 0575 per share for dividends declared in 2021 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans growth and acquisitions and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant

 

free cash flow

we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities which is the most comparable gaap measure we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the year ended december 31 in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies

critical accounting estimates and assumptions

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities longlived asset impairments the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations or as asset acquisitions and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill airspace associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related airspace associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace 

is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria

 

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer on a quarterly basis 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required 

to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately

environmental remediation liabilities 

a significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection the nature of our operations particularly with respect to the construction operation and maintenance of our landfills subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include prp investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on

 

fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities 

significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of longlived tangible and intangible assets ie property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill during the impairment evaluation process in addition the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance

property and equipment including landfills and definitelived intangible assets — we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired

the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded

indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess the indefinitelived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using level 3 inputs

we first performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value if the assessment indicated a possible impairment we completed a quantitative review comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill an impairment charge was recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount fair value is typically estimated using an income approach however when appropriate we may also use a market approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units

fair value is computed using several factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis however we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable

acquisitions  — in accordance with the purchase method of accounting the purchase price paid for an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill when we are in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition there can be subsequent adjustments to our estimates of fair value and resulting preliminary purchase price allocation

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  — gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable

we use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs we continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with thirdparty insurers in addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a whollyowned insurance captive we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of tax deductions related to these claims wm pays an annual premium to the insurance captive typically in the first quarter of the year for estimated losses based on an external actuarial analysis these premiums are held in a restricted escrow account to be used solely for paying insurance claims resulting in a transfer of risk from wm to the insurance captive and are allocated between current and longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets depending on timing on the use of funds

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2020 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity

inflation

while inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2020 approximately 34 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates certain commodity prices and canadian currency rates from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks the company had no derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2020

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities as of december 31 2020 we had 139 billion of longterm debt excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs discounts premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives we have 31 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of i 18 billion of shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program ii 12 billion of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and iii 54 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis we currently estimate that a 100basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2021 interest expense by 12 million

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our fixedrate taxexempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive debt instruments this analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous 100basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately 11 billion as of december 31 2020

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in highquality liquid instruments including 

money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis we also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in availableforsale securities including us treasury securities us agency securities municipal securities mortgage and assetbacked securities and equity securities which generally mature over the next nine years

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues may also increase or decrease

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as certain support functions in india where significant we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income including operating revenue and operating expenses however the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations

 item 1 business 

general

waste management inc is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wm” we are referring only to waste management inc the parent holding company

wm was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wm and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wm wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries for details on the financial position results of operations and cash flows of wm wm holdings and their subsidiaries see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements

our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street houston texas 77002 our telephone number is 713 5126200 our website address is wwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wm”

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provide collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states “us” during 2019 our largest customer represented less than 2 of annual revenues we employed approximately 44900 people as of december 31 2019

we own or operate 249 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in north america in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage 302 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada as well as other services that supplement our solid waste business

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address the current needs while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs of our customers

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive 

our fundamental strategy has not changed we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement we are enabling a peoplefirst technologyled focus that leverages and sustains the strongest asset network in the industry to drive bestinclass customer experience and growth our strategic planning processes appropriately consider that the future of our business and the industry can be influenced by changes in economic conditions the competitive landscape the regulatory environment asset and resource availability and technology we believe that focused differentiation which is driven by capitalizing on our unique and extensive network of assets will deliver profitable growth and position us to leverage competitive advantages simultaneously we believe the combination of cost control process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations

we believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program in december 2019 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 05125 to 0545 per share for dividends declared in 2020 which is a 63 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2019 this is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows and marks the 17th consecutive year of dividend increases all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans growth and acquisitions and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant

operations

general

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 areas see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” the services we currently provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements

 

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america as of december 31 2019 we owned or operated 244 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of 

landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and thus thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers

transfer as of december 31 2019 we owned or operated 302 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage we were the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling volumes singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of 

reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following

materials processing — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing as of december 31 2019 we operated 103 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recycling commodities are recovered for resale or redirected for other purposes

recycling commodities — we market and resell recycling commodities globally we manage the marketing of recycling commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality

recycling brokerage services  — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recycling commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recycling commodities with minimal capital requirements

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” in some cases rebates are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates but are generally based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers and depending on the key terms of the agreement are recorded as either operating expenses or a reduction in operating revenues within our consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201409 on january 1 2018 in recent years we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell

other other services we provide include the following

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts organization which is managed by our strategic business solutions “wmsbs” organization works with customers whose locations span the us and canada our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers multiple locations’ waste management needs

our energy and environmental services “ees” organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our ees organization but reflected principally in our collection line of business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection line of business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy organization landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the us environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources as of december 31 2019 we had 124 landfill gas beneficial use 

projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills for 97 of these projects the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 15 of these projects the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers for 12 of these projects the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes 

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant and organic wastetofuel conversion technology we also have expanded service offerings and solutions including fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ®  and street and parking lot sweeping services

competition

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs

seasonal trends

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the areas impacted on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time due to significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins

employees

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 44900 fulltime employees of which approximately 8600 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 8400 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements

financial assurance and insurance obligations

financial assurance

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting certain variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii a whollyowned insurance captive the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility “35 billion revolving credit facility” and other credit facilities established for that purpose

insurance

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including health and welfare general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation real and personal property directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy we use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs as of december 31 2019 both our commercial general liability insurance policy and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2019 our automobile liability insurance program included a perincident deductible of up to 10 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2019 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements

regulation

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the us and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations with acquisition development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and 

approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage

the regulatory environment in which we operate is influenced by changes in leadership at the federal state provincial and local levels the policies set forth under the current us administration for example have included substantial changes to foreign trade policy and generally have been in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the current or future administrations will have on future regulations impacting our industry especially given the number of rules currently in litigation nor can we predict the timing of any such changes reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a barrier to rapid entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve

the primary us federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below



 

we are also actively monitoring the following recent regulatory developments affecting our business

 

potential climate change ghg regulatory and corporate sustainability initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide lowcarbon services to our customers and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth we continue to anticipate the needs of our customers which include investing in and developing evermoreadvanced recycling and reuse technologies if the us were 

to impose a carbon tax or other form of ghg regulation increasing demand for lowcarbon service offerings in the future the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable

 

state provincial and local regulations

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements

our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills the number of state and local governments with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could take and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations while fitness laws can present potential increased costs and barriers to entry into market areas these laws have not and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole

recycling foreign import and export regulations and material restrictions

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products a significant portion of the fiber that we market has historically been shipped to export markets across the globe particularly china in recent years the chinese government has announced bans on certain materials and begun to enforce extremely 

restrictive quality and other requirements that have significantly reduced china’s import of recyclables the chinese government has also limited the flow of material into china by restricting the issuance of required import licenses and the restriction on import licenses is expected to constrict further in 2020 in addition changes to foreign trade policy and tariffs imposed by the current us administration have resulted in china imposing new tariffs on the import of recyclables it is currently anticipated that china will ban the import of recyclables completely in 2021 many other markets both domestic and foreign have tightened their quality expectations and limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables as well

such trade restrictions and tariffs have disrupted the global trade of recyclables particularly fiber creating excess supply and decreasing recyclable commodity prices the heightened quality requirements have been difficult for the industry to achieve and have driven up operating costs in particular singlestream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards as recyclable commodity prices have fallen and operating costs have increased recyclers are seeking to pass cost increases through to customers the resulting price increase for recycling services in communities and at businesses in the us has resulted in some customers reducing or eliminating their recycling service industry trade organizations and government agencies are engaged in discussions to mitigate longterm impacts to recycling programs and the industry as a whole

for the past several years we have been working with stakeholders to educate the public on the need to recycle properly we are investing time and labor and working with customers to help improve quality and have seen improvement in the quality of material that we receive at our facilities we have continued our focus on developing a sustainable recycling business model that meets customers’ environmental needs by passing through the increasing cost of processing and higher contamination rates and these efforts had a positive impact on the operating results for our recycling business in 2019

with a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use over 800 pieces of legislation approximately 50 of which are bans on plastic bags have been introduced in the us regulating plastics 660 passed including 585 city ordinances others include bans on the sale or use of plastic straws polystyrene plastic and single use packaging these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials however with no viable end markets for recycling these materials we and other recyclers are working to educate and remind customers of the need for end market demand and economic viability to support sustainable recycling programs with increased focus on responsible management of plastics we have taken a proactive approach to collaborate with buyers to ensure environmental sustainability goals are prioritized in managing the product we sell

regulation of oil and gas exploration production and disposal

our ees organization provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and these disposal services include use of underground injection wells there is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals there also remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production including ghg emissions or hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costprohibitive for our ees customers to continue operations adversely affecting our business

additionally any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations including through use of injection wells could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services conversely any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely affect our business as we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services

investment in natural gas vehicles and infrastructure

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet as of december 31 2019 we were operating 8924 natural gas trucks and 145 natural gas fueling facilities 25 of these fueling stations also serve the public and in some cases our facilities serve the fleet of preapproved third parties concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles additional regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business

there is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavyduty truck industry and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology such as electric powered vehicles rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles although current options for heavyduty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations requirements to transition to electric powered vehicles could increase our cost of vehicles and impair our investment in our natural gas fleet and infrastructure

renewable fuel production

we have invested and continue to invest in facilities to capture and treat renewable natural gas “rng” from the company’s landfills and rng from landfill biogas is a significant source of fuel for our natural gas collection vehicles the energy policy act of 2005 and energy independence and security act of 2007 authorize the renewable fuels standards “rfs” program that promotes the production and use of renewable transportation fuels the company is an eparegistered producer of transportation fuel making compressed and liquefied rng from landfill biogas which qualifies as a cellulosic biofuel under the rfs program oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of various categories of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as renewable identification numbers “rins” from renewable fuel producers the market value for rins is tied to renewable fuel volumes set by the epa annually and the final 2020 required volumes for cellulosic biofuel are 41 higher than in 2019 the epa also is poised to initiate a rulemaking this year that would set required volume requirements for a threeyear period from 2020 through 2022 

federal state and local climate change initiatives sustainability

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity despite the announcement that the us has begun its formal withdrawal from the paris climate accords we have seen no reduction in customer demand for services aligned with their ghg reduction goals and strategies

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events

​ 

consistent with our company’s longstanding commitment to corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship we have published our 2019 sustainability report which is an update to our full length 2018 sustainability report “driving change” which details the ghg emissions reductions we have facilitated to date and our determination to expand these reductions in the future as well as our commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe resilient and sustainable the information in this report can be found at our company website but does not constitute a part of this form 10k the company actively participates in a number of sustainability reporting programs and frameworks including the dow jones sustainability indices where we are “sector leader” for commercial services the cdp where we are among “a list” companies and the sustainability accounting standards board on which we serve as a member of the board’s advisory group

 item 1a risk factors 

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements regarding

 

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2020 and beyond and could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 1 business for more information on our business strategy

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following

 

in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by other factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses subcontractor costs and availability and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all

our planned acquisition of advanced disposal services inc “advanced disposal” may not occur at all may not occur in the expected time frame or may involve the divestiture of certain businesses and assets which may negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results 

on april 14 2019 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions we agreed to acquire advanced disposal if the acquisition is completed advanced disposal will become an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of wm the consummation of the acquisition is not assured and is subject to certain conditions including the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the absence of any law or order restraining enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acquisition as well as other customary closing conditions

the planned acquisition of advanced disposal is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including general economic and capital markets conditions the effects that the pending merger may have on us advanced disposal and our respective businesses inability to obtain required regulatory or government approvals or to obtain such approvals on satisfactory conditions inability of advanced disposal to satisfy other closing conditions the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the agreement and plan of merger several of which could require us to pay a termination fee of 150 million to advanced disposal legal proceedings that may be instituted related to the proposed acquisition and the legal expenses and diversion of management’s attention that may be associated therewith and unexpected costs charges or expenses if the planned acquisition of advanced disposal is not completed if there are significant delays in completing the planned acquisition or if the planned acquisition involves an unexpected amount of required divestitures it could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results

additionally in may 2019 we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 3 billion that include a special mandatory redemption feature this feature provides that if the acquisition of advanced disposal is not completed on or prior to july 14 2020 or if prior to such date the agreement and plan of merger is terminated for any reason we will be required to redeem all of such outstanding notes equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amounts of such notes plus accrued but unpaid interest our ability to pay the redemption price may be limited by our financial resources at the time and the terms of our debt instruments and other instruments and agreements we may also be required to incur additional indebtedness and reduce availability under our 35 billion revolving credit facility to fund the redemption price any failure to pay the special mandatory redemption price of such notes when due would constitute an event of default with respect to the notes of such series and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the market prices of our securities further if we redeem such series of notes pursuant to the special mandatory redemption feature our investors may be dissatisfied that they did not obtain the return that they expected on their investment in those notes 

we may not realize the strategic benefits and cost synergies that are anticipated from the planned acquisition of advanced disposal 

the benefits that are expected to result from the planned acquisition of advanced disposal will depend in part on our ability to realize anticipated cost synergies our success in realizing these benefits and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of advanced disposal there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition of this size the process of integrating operations could cause business interruption and distraction some members of our management may be required to devote considerable time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer

the acquisition of advanced disposal may not result in realization of the benefits and cost synergies that we currently expect and we cannot guarantee that these benefits and cost synergies will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all additionally we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of advanced disposal which may exceed expectations and offset certain benefits

compliance with existing or increased future regulations andor enforcement of such regulations can restrict or change our operations increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the us and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly many complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions restrict our operations at times and may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as

 

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills require us at times to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently we have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills and we establish accruals for these estimated costs expenditures could be accelerated or materially exceed our accruals due to the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or thirdparty landfill operators environmental regulatory changes new information about waste types previously collected such as pfas or other emerging contaminates and other reasons

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and sometimes contain conditions that limit our operations

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the regulatory environment in which we operate is influenced by changes in leadership at the federal state provincial and local levels the policies set forth under the current us administration for example have included substantial changes to foreign trade policy and generally have been in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the current administration will have on future regulations impacting our industry especially given the number of rules currently in litigation nor can we predict the timing of any such changes reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs but the extensive environmental regulation governing landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve it is likely that some policies adopted by the current administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices and commodity prices for recyclable materials are particularly susceptible to volatility based on regulations and tariffs that affect our ability to export products

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products a significant portion of the fiber that we market has historically been shipped to export markets across the globe particularly china in recent years the chinese government announced bans on certain materials and begun to enforce extremely restrictive quality and other requirements that have significantly reduced china’s import of recyclables the chinese government has also limited the flow of material into china by restricting the issuance of required import licenses and the restriction on import licenses is expected to constrict further in 2020 in addition changes to foreign trade policy and tariffs imposed by the current us administration have resulted in china imposing new tariffs on the import of recyclables we anticipate china will ban the import of recyclables completely in 2021 many other markets both domestic and foreign have tightened their quality expectations and limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables as well

such trade restrictions and tariffs have disrupted the global trade of recyclables particularly fiber creating excess supply and decreasing recyclable commodity prices we have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycling commodities but there may not be demand for all of the material we produce the heightened quality requirements have been difficult for the industry to achieve and have driven up operating costs in particular singlestream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards as recyclable commodity prices have fallen and operating costs have increased we and other recyclers are seeking to pass cost increases through to customers the resulting price increase for recycling services in communities and at businesses in the us has resulted in some customers reducing or eliminating their recycling service

reductions in market prices for recycling commodities and reduction in demand for recycling commodities and recycling services have negatively impacted our operating income and cash flows in 2018 and 2019 the decline in market prices in 2019 and 2018 for recycling commodities resulted in a decrease in revenue of 248 million and 273 million respectively as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations additionally future regulation tariffs or initiatives may result in further reduced demand or increased operating costs which would cause the profitability of our recycling operations to decline

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products significant variations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in a corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our ees organization demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices such as the low prices throughout the last few years any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future

changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas exploration production and disposal could adversely affect our ees organization

our ees organization provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and these disposal services include the use of underground injection wells demand for these services is adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to regulation and industry conditions beyond our control in addition to changes in oil and gas prices there is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals there also remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production including ghg emissions or hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costprohibitive for our ees customers to continue operations adversely affecting our business 

additionally any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations including through the use of injection wells could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services conversely any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely impact demand for our ees services

changes to the regulatory framework related to renewable fuel standards could affect our financial performance in that sector as a renewable fuel producer 

the company acts as a renewable fuel producer in the rfs program enacted by congress under the energy policy act and energy independence and security act oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as rins from renewable fuel producers the company has invested and continues to invest in facilities that capture and convert landfill gas into renewable natural gas so that we can participate in the program the value of the rins associated with our landfill gas is set through a market established by the program the epa finalized a rule in december 2019 increasing refiners’ obligations to purchase renewable natural gas and other cellulosic biofuels under the rfs program for compliance year 2020 unlike in prior years however market uncertainty stemming from the epa’s administration of the rfs program led to a rapid decline in rin values we continue to advocate for the epa to implement policies that ensure longterm stability for renewable transportation fuels as changes in the rfs market or the structure of the rfs program can and has reduced the value of renewable natural gas rins and negatively impacted the financial performance of the facilities constructed to capture and treat the gas

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and bans on certain types of waste could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills providing services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives

with a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use over 800 pieces of 

legislation approximately 50 of which are bans on plastic bags have been introduced in the us regulating plastics 660 passed including 585 city ordinances others include bans on the sale or use of plastic straws polystyrene plastic and single use packaging these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials however there are currently no viable end markets for recycling these materials and inclusion of such materials in our recycling stream increases contamination and operating costs and can negatively affect the results of our recycling operations

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that innovate our operations improve the customer experience and provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if it is alleged that our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved and for conditions resulting from waste types or compounds previously considered nonhazardous but later determined to present possible threat to public health or the 

environment the risks of successor liability and emerging contaminants are of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which

 

we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which negatively impacts the ability to grow through new business or service upgrades and may result in customer turnover and reduction in customers’ waste service needs consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may also reduce the number and variety of services requested by customers additionally a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows 

a decrease in waste volumes generated results in an increase in competitive pricing pressure such economic conditions may also interfere with our ability to implement our pricing strategy many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase more than the increase if any in the consumer price index this is partially due to our relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels and vendor costs and may not correlate with the consumer price index or the waste industry

weakness in the economy may expose us to credit risk of governmental entities and municipalities and other major customers which could negatively impact our operating results

we provide service to a number of governmental entities municipalities and large national accounts during periods of economic weakness governmental entities and municipalities can suffer significant financial difficulties due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures during these periods such entities and our nongovernmental customers could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates

purchasers of our recycling commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2019 we had 669 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and 355 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis if market dynamics resulted in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we would incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subjected or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally if fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally lawsuits have challenged our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins

we have made significant investments in an extensive natural gas truck fleet which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices and requirements to transition to other vehicle types could impair these investments

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet however natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in north america as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce 

the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program

there is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavyduty truck industry and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology such as electric powered vehicles rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles although current options for heavyduty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations requirements to transition to electric powered vehicles could increase our cost of vehicles and impair our investment in our natural gas fleet and infrastructure

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations

we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations 

we are in the process of a complex multiyear implementation of a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system the erp system implementation requires the integration of the new erp system with multiple new and existing information systems and business processes and is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information to our management team important to the operation of the business such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective the implementation of the erp system may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and it is possible that the system will not yield the benefits anticipated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations resulting in negative impacts on our business and operations and subject us to potential liability additionally our implementation of the erp system involves greater utilization of thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations problems faced by us or our thirdparty providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to increased liability

substantially all aspects of our business operations rely on digital technology we use computers mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees and our customers these uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber intrusions and we must commit substantial resources to continuously monitor and further develop our networks and infrastructure to prevent detect and address the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be effective in all cases the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption direct financial loss negative publicity brand damage alleged 

violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential regulatory enforcement or private litigation liability and competitive disadvantage

further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk certain new technologies such as use of autonomous vehicles remotecontrolled equipment and virtual reality present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection issues and expanding laws could negatively impact our business subject us to criticism and expose us to increased liability 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future we collect certain personally identifiable information and other sensitive information as integral parts of our business and in connection with providing services to our customers we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern the collection and use of such information obtained from individuals and businesses these laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving interpretations government officials regulators privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data we must continually monitor the development and adoption of new and emerging laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” that took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that can expand the scope of our potential liability we must commit substantial time and resources toward compliance with the ccpa and similar laws and regulations any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newly acquired companies could subject us to regulatory enforcement private litigation public criticism disrupt our operations cause us to lose customers result in additional costs and legal liability damage our reputation and otherwise harm our business

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful would enhance organized labor’s leverage to obtain higher than expected wage and benefits costs and resist the introduction of new technology and other initiatives which can result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans “multiemployer pension plans” for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal depending on various factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period see notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills transfer stations mrfs and other disposal facilities involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures additionally we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability releases of hazardous materials and odors that are sometimes triggered by weather or natural disasters there are also risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate landfill gas and odors we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage and property damage or destruction

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training compliance and response and recovery programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand additionally a major operational failure even if suffered by a competitor may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry with a corresponding increase in operating expense

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due

we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that have in the past and may in the future lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally 

declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we have in the past and may in the future be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile and several other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by thirdparty rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected

additionally we have 10 billion of debt as of december 31 2019 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the impact of our taxexempt bonds if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow

we may use our 35 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in november 2024 as of december 31 2019 we had no outstanding borrowings and 412 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility leaving unused and available credit capacity of 31 billion in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate

the impact of climate change and the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate

we continue to assess the physical risks to our operations from the effects of climate change although we have made investments to mitigate risk associated with severe storm events damage to our facilities or disruption of service caused by more frequent or more severe storms associated with climate extremes could negatively impact operating results we have also identified risk to our assets and our employees associated with drought or water scarcity flooding extreme heat and rain events and fire conditions associated with climate change for example wildfires influenced by climate change can damage landfill infrastructure such as gas collection systems flooding in lowlying areas enhanced by sea level rise can result in greater maintenance expenses at our facilities and service disruption and more frequent or extreme rain events can erode the protective vegetative caps on our landfills and generate increased volumes of leachate to manage those areas of the country most prone to these occurrences have protocols in place or are developing protocols to address these conditions including employee safety driver training and equipment and facility protection protocols we have incurred and will incur costs to develop and implement these protocols and these protocols may not be effective in offsetting these risks additionally the actions of others in response to climate change effects such as the rolling power blackouts implemented in california in 2019 due to wildfire risks can result in service disruptions and increase our costs to operate

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state provincial regional and federal levels to cap andor curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change we continue to monitor these efforts and the potential impacts to our operations should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v ghg tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however if certain changes to these regulations were enacted such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events resulting from climate change and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time due to significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with us or foreign laws or regulations

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements

overview

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy we own or operate the largest network of landfills in north america in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity additionally we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the us

our solid waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of 

collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental fee fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business described under results of operations below

business environment 

the waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry however customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills we monitor these developments to adapt our services offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we promote our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs

despite some industry consolidation in recent years we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private service providers based on pricing service quality customer experience and breadth of service offerings our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors including increases and decreases in consumer spending business expansions and construction starts these factors generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and impact our revenue negative economic conditions in addition to competitor actions can make it more challenging to negotiate renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins and in addition customers may reduce their service needs we also encounter competition for acquisitions and growth opportunities general economic factors and the market for consumer goods in addition to regulatory developments can also significantly impact commodity prices for the recyclable materials we sell our operating expenses are directly impacted by volume levels as volume levels shift due to economic and other factors we must manage our network capacity and cost structure accordingly

in 2019 we have benefited from a generally favorable macroeconomic environment including steady spending by consumers and businesses which have led to volume and gross margin growth we experienced growth in our collection and disposal lines of business particularly in the segments of our business driven by the consumer portion of the economy volume growth is also the result of proactive efforts taken to work with our customers as their needs expand to identify service upgrade opportunities overall in 2019 our landfill volumes were favorably impacted by growth in our municipal solid waste business cleanup efforts from natural disasters in california during 2019 and eventdriven projects the portion of our business driven by the industrial segment of the economy such as special waste continues to show growth although the pace of growth is starting to moderate as large industrial customers take a more cautious approach to awarding work for special projects additionally we continued our focus on developing a sustainable recycling business model that meets customers’ environmental needs but is also economically sustainable given pressures on the business from lower market values for recycled commodities and higher contamination fees we have been working to improve its financial returns by driving a feebased pricing model that addresses the cost of processing materials and the impact on our costs of contamination these efforts provided significant value to our 2019 results though that value was more than offset by continued declines in market prices for recycled commodities we will continue to take steps necessary to improve longterm profitability of our recycling line of business

overall the company’s operations performed well in 2019 we expect the company’s industryleading asset network and strategic focuses on investing in people technology and growth to drive continued growth in the year ahead

current year financial results 

during 2019 we continued to produce strong operating results from our collection and disposal business driven by favorable market conditions and our focus on delivering an outstanding customer experience and continuous improvement the company continued its commitment to supporting both organic and inorganic growth during 2019 allocating 1818 million of available cash to capital expenditures and 527 million to the acquisition of solid waste businesses of which 6 million was recorded as cash flow from financing activities related to the timing of contingent consideration paid we also allocated 1124 million to our shareholders during 2019 through dividends and common stock repurchases

key items of our 2019 financial results include

    

 

results of operations

operating revenues

our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business including both our wmsbs and ees organizations recycling brokerage services landfill gastoenergy services and certain other expanded service offerings and solutions 

the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended december 31 in millions

 

 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues and average yield for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions

 

 

the following provides further details about our periodtoperiod change in revenues

average yield

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer and landfill operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to the types of services provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers

the details of our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield for the years ended december 31 are as follows dollars in millions

 ​ 

our strategic pricing efforts focus on ensuring we overcome inflationary cost pressures and grow margins this strategy has been most successful in our collection line of business for both 2019 and 2018 we are also experiencing solid growth in our landfill and transfer businesses with our municipal solid waste business experiencing 38 and 22 average yield growth for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively as compared with the prior year periods

recycling commodities — decreases in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in revenue declines of 248 million and 273 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively as compared with the prior year periods we partially offset our revenue decline by assessing fees to cover the higher costs of handling contaminated recycling materials average market prices for recycling commodities at the company’s facilities were 35 lower in 2019 compared to 2018 and 40 lower in 2018 compared to 2017 we have seen a decreased demand from paper mills around the world which had driven prices to historical low averages there are several domestic mill projects anticipated to start during 2020 that we expect will add additional capacity and more local demand for recycled materials however we do not expect material changes in market prices for recycling commodities as a result of this additional capacity the cardboard packaging industry has been impacted by slower global demand retail store closures and ecommerce packaging efficiency we will continue to take steps necessary to improve longterm profitability of our recycling line of business

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these fees which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program declined 22 million for 2019 and increased 111 million for 2018 as compared with the prior year periods these revenues are based on and fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel market prices for diesel fuel decreased approximately 4 and increased 20 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively compared with the prior year periods the decline in fuel surcharges for 2019 was partially offset by an increase in mandated fees the mandated fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations

volume

our revenues from volume increased 346 million or 23 and 478 million or 33 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively as compared with the prior year periods excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures

we experienced higher volumes throughout 2019 and 2018 due to our focus on customer service and disciplined growth combined with favorable market conditions in our collection and disposal business we have experienced significant volume growth with existing customers particularly in our commercial collection business as a result of proactive efforts taken to work with our customers as their needs expand to identify service upgrade opportunities our eventdriven projects in our special waste business and growth in our municipal solid waste business contributed to our landfill volume growth in both 2019 and 2018 additionally a large contract executed in the second half of 2017 increased volume at our transfer stations for 2018 with incremental volume additions during 2018 that favorably impacted our volumes in 2019 furthermore our wmsbs organization experienced favorable volume growth in both 2019 and 2018 

the cleanup efforts of natural disasters throughout the us in the first half of 2019 also contributed to volume growth in 2019 however volume decline from our recycling brokerage services negatively impacted our volume growth in 2019 additionally a volume increase from our recycling brokerage services affected the comparability of volumes for 2018 and 2017

foreign currency translation and other 

fluctuations in foreign currency affect revenues from our canadian operations additionally 2018 was unfavorably impacted by a revenue decline associated with the adoption of asu 201409

operating expenses

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits costs excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business including certain rebates paid to suppliers vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and x other operating costs which include gains and losses on sale of assets telecommunications equipment and facility lease expenses property taxes utilities and supplies variations in volumes yearoveryear as discussed above in operating revenues  in addition to cost inflation affect the comparability of the components of our operating expenses

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was driven by i volume growth in our collection and disposal business ii merit increases and iii cost inflation noted above these cost increases were offset in part by lower bonus costs related to a onetime plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by i volume growth in our collection line of business ii the onetime bonus plan established in early 2018 and iii merit increases

transfer and disposal costs  — the increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 and 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by overall volume growth in our collection and disposal business and to a lesser extent cost inflation

maintenance and repairs  — the increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was largely driven by i cost inflation noted above which primarily impacted labor parts thirdparty services tires and building costs and ii a 16 million noncash charge to write off certain equipment costs related to our other segment 

the increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by i higher labor costs from volume growth and cost inflation and ii higher thirdparty service and parts costs

subcontractor costs  — the increase in subcontractor costs in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by i volume growth in our collection and disposal business largely attributable to a significant contract executed in the second half of 2017 that generated incremental volumes in 2019 ii volume growth in our wmsbs and ees organizations and iii cost inflation related to capacity constraints of our subcontractors in certain markets the increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven primarily by volume growth in our collection and disposal business

cost of goods sold — the decrease in cost of goods sold in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily driven by lower market prices for recycling commodities and by lower costs due to the sale of certain ancillary operations in the second quarter of 2018 the decrease in cost of goods sold in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by i lower market prices for recycling commodities and ii a change in accounting for certain customer rebates due to the adoption of asu 201409 in 2018

fuel — the decrease in fuel costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was due to i recognition of a 70 million benefit from the extension of federal natural gas fuel credits in 2019 compared to 28 million in 2018 ii lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and iii lower market prices for diesel fuel the increase in fuel costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was due to higher market prices for diesel fuel partially offset by the recognition of a 28 million benefit from the extension of federal natural gas fuel credits

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — the increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily related to higher volumes in our landfill line of business the decrease in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by the adoption of asu 201409 in 2018 specifically certain franchise fees were treated as disposal fees and taxes in the prior year periods and beginning in 2018 were treated as a reduction in operating revenues in the current year period

landfill operating costs — the increase in landfill operating costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to higher leachate management costs driven largely by inclement weather in certain parts of north america and increased ongoing site maintenance costs additionally 2019 was impacted by a decrease in the riskfree discount rate used in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets due to a decrease in us treasury rates see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

risk management  — the increase in risk management costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to an increase in claims expense as a result of growth in the business and cost inflation the increase in risk management costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily due to an increase in claims expense

other — net gains on sales of certain assets in 2018 impacted the comparability of the reported periods

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefits costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising bank charges computer costs travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation reserves generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

significant items affecting the comparison of our selling general and administrative expenses between reported periods include

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due to i an increase in headcount merit increases and higher incentive compensation and ii increased contract labor costs driven by our planned investments in technology the decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to i lower incentive compensation accruals in 2018 and ii severance costs for former executives incurred in 2017 which were partially offset by merit increases and a onetime bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention 

professional fees  — the increase in professional fees in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by higher consulting fees related to our strategic investments in operating customer facing and backoffice technologies as well as costs incurred in preparation for our pending acquisition of advanced disposal services inc “advanced disposal” the increase in professional fees in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the investments we are making in technology and higher legal fees

provision for bad debts  — the decrease in provision for bad debts in 2019 compared with 2018 was due to i collection of certain fully reserved receivables and ii higher prior year bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of a strategic customer the increase in provision of bad debts in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to increased revenues and the bankruptcy of a strategic customer

other — the increase in other expenses in 2019 compared with 2018 was principally driven by higher litigation reserves and increased infrastructure costs associated with our investments in technology the increase in other expenses in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to higher litigation reserves in 2018 which were partially offset by lower costs associated with advertising and travel and entertainment as we continued to focus on controlling costs 

depreciation and amortization expenses

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues

 ​ 

the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during the reported periods was primarily related to higher capital expenditures due to an intentional focus on accelerating certain fleet and landfill spending to support the company’s strong collection and disposal growth the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during the reported periods was driven by higher volumes at our landfills and changes in landfill estimates

gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net

the following table summarizes the major components of gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net for the years ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized asset impairments of 42 million related to i 27 million of goodwill impairment charges as discussed further in note 6 of which 17 million related to our ees organization and 10 million related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit and ii 15 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to certain solid waste operations 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized net gains of 58 million primarily related to i a 52 million gain associated with the sale of certain collection and disposal operations in tier 1 and ii net gains of 44 million substantially all from divestitures of certain ancillary operations these gains were partially offset by i a 30 million charge to impair a landfill in tier 3 based on an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis taking into account continued volume decreases and revised capping cost estimates and ii 8 million of impairment charges primarily related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized net gains of 16 million primarily related to i gains of 31 million from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties and ii a 30 million reduction in postclosing performancebased contingent consideration obligations associated with an acquired business in our ees organization these gains were partially offset by i 34 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our ees organization ii 11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in harris county texas as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and iii 7 million of charges to write down certain renewable energy assets

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments

 percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison

 

solid waste — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three years ended december 31 2019 are summarized below

the following items affected both comparable periods

 

however the following items negatively impacted our results from operations and resulted in lower income from operations in 2019 when compared with 2018

 

in addition the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017



 

other — in 2019 compared with 2018 lower income from operations is a result of i net gains from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in the prior year period of 44 million ii 27 million of goodwill impairment charges of which 17 million related to our ees organization and 10 million related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit iii lower commodity prices in 2019 associated with our wm renewable energy organization iv a 16 million noncash charge to write off certain equipment costs in 2019 and v an increase in claims expense as a result of growth in the business and cost inflation in 2018 compared with 2017 our other segment benefited from net gains from divestitures of certain ancillary operations and improved results in our ees and wm renewable energy organizations partially offset by higher risk management costs our 2017 results were also favorably affected by a reduction in contingent consideration obligations in our ees organization

corporate and other — the most significant items affecting the results of operations for corporate and other during the three years ended december 31 2019 are summarized below

the following items affected 2019 when compared with 2018

 

in addition the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017

 

interest expense net

our interest expense net was 411 million 374 million and 363 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in 2019 is primarily attributable to our may 2019 issuance of 40 billion senior notes partially offset by related increases in interest income as a result of higher cash and cash equivalents balances these items are discussed further below in liquidity and capital resources 

loss on early extinguishment of debt

in may 2019 wm issued 40 billion of senior notes which are discussed further below in summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations  concurrently we used 344 million of the net proceeds from the newly issued senior notes to retire 257 million of certain highcoupon senior notes the cash paid includes the principal amount of the debt retired 84 million of related premiums which are classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations and 3 million of accrued interest the principal amount of senior notes redeemed within each series was as follows

​ 

 ​ 

in the third quarter of 2019 we elected to refund and reissue 99 million of taxexempt bonds which resulted in the recognition of a 1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities

we recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of 55 million 41 million and 68 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the losses for each period are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility we generate tax benefits including tax credits from the losses incurred from these investments which are discussed further in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the amount in 2017 includes impairment charges of 29 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their estimated fair values

other net

we recognized other net expense of 50 million and 8 million in 2019 and 2017 respectively compared to other net income of 2 million in 2018 in 2019 we recognized a 52 million impairment charge related to our minorityowned investment in a waste conversion technology business we wrote down our investment to its estimated fair value as the result of recent thirdparty investor’s transactions in securities of this business the fair value of our investment was not readily determinable thus we determined the fair value utilizing a combination of quoted price inputs for the equity in our investment level 2 and certain management assumptions pertaining to investment value level 3 the expense for 2017 was impacted by impairment charges of 11 million related to otherthantemporary declines in the value of minorityowned investments in waste diversion technology companies 

income tax expense

we recorded income tax expense of 434 million 453 million and 242 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively resulting in effective income tax rates of 206 190 and 110 for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following

 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis

we owned or operated 244 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2019 and 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2018 for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity as measured in tons of waste for the years ended december 31 and remaining airspace measured in cubic yards of waste as of december 31 in millions

 

 

the tons received at our landfills for the years ended december 31 are shown below tons in thousands

 



 

when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our environmental legacy management group as of december 31 2019 our environmental legacy management group managed 212 closed landfills

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2019 and projected annual disposal volume the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume disposal prices construction and operating costs remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions — landfills section below although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 41 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume

the number of landfills owned or operated as of december 31 2019 segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows

 

 

as of december 31 2019 we have 14 landfills which are not currently accepting waste during the year ended december 31 2019 we performed tests of recoverability for five of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of 272 million for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values we did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining nine landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was not material

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below

the changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended december 31 2019 are reflected in the table below in millions

 ​ 

as of december 31 2019 we estimate that we will spend approximately 600 million in 2020 and approximately 13 billion in 2021 and 2022 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated

the changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended december 31 2019 are reflected in the table below in millions

 

 

landfill operating costs — the following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

amortization of landfill airspace  — amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses includes the following

 

amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill net of accumulated amortization by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total permitted and expansion airspace final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated permitted and expansion airspace accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis for the years ended december 31

different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 249 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company each year

liquidity and capital resources 

the company consistently generates cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds its working capital needs the payments of its dividend and investment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities the company believes that its investment grade credit ratings large value of unencumbered assets 

and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital operating and other liquidity requirements

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 in millions

 

 cash and cash equivalents — cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019 primarily include proceeds from the may 2019 issuance of senior notes and our september 2019 issuance of canadian senior notes these items are discussed further below and in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

debt — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our borrowings as of december 31 2019 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

as of december 31 2019 we had 15 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months including i 600 million of 475 senior notes that mature in june 2020 ii 669 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities and iii 218 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months including 112 million of taxexempt bonds as of december 31 2019 we have classified 13 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as longterm because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our 35 billion longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility “35 billion revolving credit facility” as discussed below the remaining 218 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations 

as of december 31 2019 we also have 169 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit under our 35 billion revolving credit facility of which 15 million mature within the next 12 months the interest rates on our variablerate taxexempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process all recent taxexempt bond remarketings have successfully placed company bonds with investors at marketdriven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful however if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we have the availability under our 35 billion revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully accordingly we have classified 154 million of these borrowings as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019

in may 2019 wm issued 40 billion of senior notes consisting of

​ 

 ​ 

the net proceeds from these debt issuances were 397 billion concurrently we used 344 million of the net proceeds from the newly issued senior notes to retire 257 million of certain highcoupon senior notes the cash paid includes the principal amount of the debt retired 84 million of related premiums and 3 million of accrued interest as discussed above in loss on early extinguishment of debt  we used a portion of the proceeds to repay our commercial paper borrowings we intend to use the remaining net proceeds to pay a portion of the consideration related to our pending acquisition of advanced disposal which is discussed in pending acquisition below and for general corporate purposes the newlyissued senior notes due 2024 2026 2029 and 2039 include a special mandatory redemption feature which provides that if the acquisition of advanced disposal is not completed on or prior to july 14 2020 or if prior to such date the merger agreement is terminated for any reason we will be required to redeem all of such outstanding notes equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amounts of such notes plus accrued but unpaid interest

​ 

in september 2019 waste management of canada corporation an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of wm issued c500 million or 377 million of 26 senior notes due september 23 2026 all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by wm and wm holdings the net proceeds from the debt issuance were c496 million or 373 million which we intend to use for general corporate purposes

​ 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the debt transactions

​ 

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit categorized by type of facility as of december 31 in millions

 

 

refinancing of revolving credit facility

in november 2019 we entered into the 35 billion revolving credit facility which amended and restated our prior longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility amendments to the credit agreement included i increasing total capacity under the facility from 275 billion to 35 billion ii increasing the accordion feature that may be used to increase total capacity in future periods from 750 million to 10 billion and iii extending the term through november 2024 the agreement provides the company with two oneyear extension options waste management of canada corporation and wm quebec inc each an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of wm are borrowers under the 35 billion revolving credit facility and the agreement permits borrowing in canadian dollars up to the us dollar equivalent of 375 million with such borrowings to be repaid in canadian dollars wm holdings a whollyowned subsidiary of wm guarantees all the obligations under the 35 billion revolving credit facility

summary of cash flow activity

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions

 ​ 

net cash provided by operating activities — our operating cash flows increased by 304 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared with the prior year period as a result of i higher cashbased earnings in the current year period primarily associated with our collection and disposal business ii lower bonus payments in the current year iii lower income tax payments of 57 million in the current year and iv net favorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures offset slightly by higher interest payments in the current year period primarily due to our may 2019 issuance of senior notes

our operating cash flows increased by 390 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared with the prior year period as a result of i higher earnings primarily associated with our collection and disposal business and ii lower income tax payments of 213 million driven by enactment of tax reform and timing of income tax payments partially offset by lower earnings from our recycling line of business

net cash used in investing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below

 

net cash provided by used in financing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below

 

 ​ 

 refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments

 

in december 2019 we publicly confirmed that the company has 132 billion remaining on its existing board of directors’ authorization to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations

 

we paid aggregate cash dividends of 876 million 802 million and 750 million during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 0425 

in 2017 to 0465 in 2018 and to 05125 in 2019 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program

in december 2019 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 05125 to 0545 per share for dividends declared in 2020 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans growth and acquisitions and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant

 

free cash flow

we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities which is the most comparable gaap measure we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the years ended december 31 in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies

summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions

 

 

pending acquisition

on april 14 2019 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” to acquire all outstanding shares of advanced disposal for 3315 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of 49 billion when including approximately 19 billion of advanced disposal’s net debt advanced disposal’s solid waste network includes 95 collection operations 73 transfer stations 41 owned or operated landfills and 22 owned or operated recycling facilities on june 28 2019 advanced disposal announced that 859 of the outstanding shares of its common stock entitled to vote were voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at a special meeting of stockholders held that day we anticipate that we will obtain antitrust regulatory approval by the end of march 2020 and close the advanced disposal transaction soon thereafter

critical accounting estimates and assumptions

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities longlived asset impairments and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill airspace associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related airspace associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill 

closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria

 

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer on a quarterly basis 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the 

corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately

environmental remediation liabilities 

a significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection the nature of our operations particularly with respect to the construction operation and maintenance of our landfills subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include prp investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on

 

longlived asset impairments 

we assess our longlived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards if necessary impairments are recorded in gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net in our consolidated statement of operations

property and equipment including landfills and definitelived intangible assets — we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 

if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired

the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded

indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess the indefinitelived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using level 3 inputs

we first performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value if the assessment indicated a possible impairment we completed a quantitative review comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill an impairment charge was recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount fair value is typically estimated using an income approach however when appropriate we may also use a market approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units

fair value is computed using several factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis however we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  — gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities 

could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable

we use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs we continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with thirdparty insurers in addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a whollyowned insurance captive we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of tax deductions related to these claims wm will pay an annual premium to the insurance captive typically in the first quarter of the year for the estimated losses based on the external actuarial analysis these premiums are held in a restricted escrow account to be used solely for paying insurance claims resulting in a transfer of risk from wm to the insurance captive and are allocated between current and longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets depending on timing on the use of funds

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2019 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity

inflation

while inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2019 approximately 30 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates certain commodity prices and canadian currency rates from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks the company had no derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2019

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities as of december 31 2019 we had 136 billion of longterm debt excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs discounts premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives we have 10 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of i 669 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and ii 355 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis we currently estimate that a 100basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2020 interest expense by 7 million

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our fixedrate taxexempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive debt instruments this analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous 100basis point 

increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately 10 billion as of december 31 2019

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis we also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in availableforsale securities including us treasury securities us agency securities municipal securities mortgage and assetbacked securities and equity securities which generally mature over the next 10 years

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues may also increase or decrease

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as certain support functions in india where significant we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income including operating revenue and operating expenses however the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations

waste management inc is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wm” we are referring only to waste management inc the parent holding company 

wm was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wm and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wm wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries for details on the financial position results of operations and cash flows of wm wm holdings and their subsidiaries see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street houston texas 77002 our telephone number is 713 512‑6200 our website address is wwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10‑k quarterly reports on form 10‑q and current reports on form 8‑k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wm” 

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services our “traditional solid waste” business excludes our recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states “us” during 2018 our largest customer represented 1 of annual revenues we employed approximately 43700 people as of december 31 2018 

we own or operate 252 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in north america in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage 314 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada as well as other services that supplement our traditional solid waste business 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address the current needs while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs of our customers 

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive 

 

our fundamental strategy has not changed we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement our strategic planning processes appropriately consider that the future of our business and the industry can be influenced by changes in economic conditions the competitive landscape the regulatory environment asset and resource availability and technology we believe that focused differentiation which is driven by capitalizing on our unique and extensive network of assets will deliver profitable growth and position us to leverage competitive advantages simultaneously we believe the combination of cost control process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations 

we believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program in december 2018 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0465 to 05125 per share for dividends declared in 2019 which is a 102 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2018 this is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows and marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans growth and acquisitions and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 

operations 

general 

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 areas see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” the services we currently provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below 

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 





landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america as of december 31 2018 we owned or operated 247 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must 

 

meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and thus thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer as of december 31 2018 we owned or operated 314 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage we were the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling volumes singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of 

 

reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing as of december 31 2018 we operated 102 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recycling commodities are recovered for resale or redirected for other purposes 

recycling commodities — we market and resell recycling commodities globally we manage the marketing of recycling commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

recycling brokerage services  — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recycling commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recycling commodities with minimal capital requirements 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” in some cases rebates are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates but are generally based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers and depending on the key terms of the agreement are recorded as either operating expenses or a reduction in operating revenues within our consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201409 on january 1 2018 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in recent years we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell 

other other services we provide include the following 

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts organization which is managed by our strategic business solutions “wmsbs” organization works with customers whose locations span the us and canada our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers multiple locations’ waste management needs 

our energy and environmental services “ees” organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our ees organization but reflected principally in our collection line of business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection line of business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy organization landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the us environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the 

 

same category as wind solar and geothermal resources as of december 31 2018 we had 130 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills for 101 of these projects the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 15 of these projects the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers for 14 of these projects the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes 

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology we also have expanded service offerings and solutions including fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ®  and street and parking lot sweeping services 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

seasonal trends 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

 

employees 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 43700 fulltime employees of which approximately 8200 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 8300 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting certain variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity 

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii a whollyowned insurance captive the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our longterm us and canadian revolving credit facility “275 billion revolving credit facility” and other credit facilities established for that purpose 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation real and personal property directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy in december 2017 we elected to use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs as of december 31 2018 both our commercial general liability insurance policy and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2018 our automobile liability insurance program included a perincident deductible of up to 10 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2018 are summarized in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the us and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations with acquisition development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and 

 

approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

in recent years we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry the current us presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the current administration will have on regulations impacting our industry especially given the number of rules currently in litigation nor can we predict the timing of any such changes reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve 

the primary us federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 







 





the epa and the department of transportation finalized greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavyduty engines and vehicles – phase 2 on august 16 2016 the rule will increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions standards for our collection fleet between model years 2021 and 2027 we expect to be able to purchase fully compliant vehicles that will meet our operational needs and while the regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 



we are also actively monitoring the following recent regulatory developments affecting our business 



since 2014 decisions from the us supreme court and us court of appeals for the dc circuit as well as epa policy memorandum have significantly narrowed the applicability and scope of epa permitting requirements for ghgs from stationary sources including with respect to biogenic carbon dioxide “co2” permitting in 

 

2016 the epa proposed revisions to the psd and title v ghg permitting regulations establishing a significant emissions rate “ser” threshold below which sources would not be required to implement additional control technologies for their ghg emissions this ser threshold should prevent most of our operational changes such as landfill expansions and beneficial gas recovery projects from being subject to psd or title v permit requirements due to our ghg emissions – assuming the epa classifies biogenic co2 emissions from municipal solid waste and landfill gas as carbon neutral the epa has not yet finalized this rulemaking the epa also has not yet finalized its policy for addressing biogenic co2 emissions from waste management however the epa’s independent science advisory board has recommended it treat wastederived co2 emissions as carbonneutral these recent judicial and regulatory actions have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the potential impact of the psd and title v ghg tailoring rule on our air permits compliance and operating requirements see item 1a risk factors  — the adoption   of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

other recent regulatory actions to increase the stringency of certain national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” could affect the cost timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gastoenergy facilities however the epa under the current administration is reviewing the implementation of the new naaqs and considering revisions to make the regulations less stringent while we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of potential revisions to naaqs we do not believe that the ultimate requirements will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 

we continue to anticipate the needs of our customers which includes investing in and developing evermoreadvanced recycling and reuse technologies potential climate change ghg regulatory and corporate sustainability initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide lowcarbon services to our customers and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth if the us were to impose a carbon tax or other form of ghg regulation increasing demand for lowcarbon service offerings in the future the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable 





state provincial and local regulations 

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most 

 

cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills the number of state and local governments with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could take and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations while fitness laws can present potential increased costs and barriers to entry into market areas these laws have not and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 

recycling foreign import and export regulations 

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products a significant portion of the fiber that we market has been shipped to export markets across the globe particularly china in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics and restrict the import of certain other plastic recyclables in 2017 the chinese government announced a ban on certain materials including mixed waste paper and mixed plastics effective january 1 2018 as well as extremely restrictive quality requirements effective march 1 2018 that have been difficult for the industry to achieve many other markets both domestic and foreign have tightened their quality expectations as well in addition other countries have limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables 

 

single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards also in 2017 the chinese government began to limit the flow of material into the country by restricting the issuance of required import licenses the use of restrictions on import licenses to restrict flow into china continued in 2018 and is expected to continue to constrict in 2019 additionally increased container weight tracking and port fees have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry and have resulted in increased price volatility the current us presidential administration has made substantial changes to foreign trade policy and imposed increases in tariffs on international trade in response china has imposed new tariffs on the import of recyclable commodities including wastepaper plastics and metals such restrictions and tariffs may have a significant impact on our recycling operations 

in recent years we have been revising our service agreements to address increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the public on the need to recycle properly we are investing time and labor and working with customers to help improve quality however there is uncertainty about the industry’s ability to adapt to the stricter quality expectations we have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycled commodities but it is possible there may not be sufficient demand for all of the material we produce resulting in price decreases and volatility industry trade organizations and government agencies are engaged in discussions to mitigate longterm impacts to recycling programs and the industry as a whole 

with a heightened awareness of the global problems of plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use bans on single use plastic bags straws and polystyrene food containers have been passed in over 350 cities and a ban on single use plastic bags has been implemented in the state of california these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials however with no viable end markets for recycling these materials we and other recyclers are working to educate and remind customers of the need for end market demand and economic viability to support sustainable recycling programs 

regulation of oil and gas exploration production and disposal 

our ees organization provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and these disposal services include use of underground injection wells there is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals there also remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production including ghg emissions or hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costprohibitive for our ees customers to continue operations adversely affecting our business 

additionally any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations including through use of injection wells could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services conversely any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely affect our business as we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services 

emissions from natural gas fueling and infrastructure 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet as of december 31 2018 we were operating 7621 natural gas trucks and 123 natural gas fueling facilities 25 of these fueling stations also serve the public and in some cases our facilities serve the fleet of preapproved third parties concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles we have partnered with the environmental organization environmental defense fund as well as other heavyduty equipment users and experts on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers we anticipate that 

 

this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavyduty fleet may ultimately help inform regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry additional regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our future investment in natural gas vehicles 

renewable fuel production 

we have invested and continue to invest in facilities to capture and treat renewable natural gas “rng” from the company’s landfills and we use rng from landfill biogas in approximately 30 of our natural gas collection vehicles the energy policy act of 2005 and energy independence and security act of 2007 authorize the renewable fuels standards “rfs” program that promotes the production and use of renewable transportation fuels the company is an eparegistered producer of transportation fuel making compressed and liquefied rng from landfill biogas which qualifies as a cellulosic biofuel under the rfs program oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of various categories of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as renewable identification numbers “rins” from renewable fuel producers the market value for rins is tied to renewable fuel volumes set by the epa annually and the final 2019 required volumes for cellulosic biofuel are 45 higher than in 2018 the epa is required to develop a rulemaking this year that will set required volume requirements for a three‑year period from 2020 through 2022 based on the overall political framework and the upcoming rulemakings we anticipate a stable market for the company’s rins  

federal state and local climate change initiatives sustainability 

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity despite the announcement that the us will withdraw from the paris climate accords we have seen no reduction in customer demand for services aligned with their ghg reduction goals and strategies moreover we have seen initiatives at the federal state and local level to enhance the environmental benefits in terms of ghg reductions realized by recycling programs by focusing on reducing contamination in the recyclable material 

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events 

  

consistent with our company’s longstanding commitment to corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship we have published our 2018 sustainability report “driving change” which details the ghg emissions reductions we have facilitated to date and our determination to expand these reductions in the future as well as our commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe resilient and sustainable the information in this report can be found at our company website but does not constitute a part of this form 10k the company actively participates in a number of sustainability reporting programs and frameworks including the dow jones sustainability index where we are “sector leader” for commercial services the cdp where we are among “a list” companies and the sustainability accounting standards board on which we serve as a member of the board’s advisory council 

  

 

  


 item 1a risk factors   

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements containing 









you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2019 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations we principally compete with large national waste management companies counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources the industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 1 business for more information on our business strategy 

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 



 























in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses subcontractor costs and availability and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

compliance with existing or increased future regulations andor enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the us and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly many complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters 

 

among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 











regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals because of the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or thirdparty landfill operators or due to new information about waste types previously collected among other reasons environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in recent years we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry the current us presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the current administration will 

 

have on the political and regulatory environment in the us the timing of any such changes or the impact of any such changes on our business reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve it is likely that some policies adopted by the current administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us 

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices and commodity prices for recyclable materials are particularly susceptible to volatility based on regulations and tariffs that affect our ability to export products 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and plastics which are subject to significant market price fluctuations most of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint and a significant portion of the fiber that we market has been shipped to export markets across the globe particularly china in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics and restrict the import of certain other plastic recyclables in 2017 the chinese government announced a ban on certain materials including mixed waste paper and mixed plastics effective january 1 2018 as well as extremely restrictive quality requirements effective march 1 2018 that have been difficult for the industry to achieve many other markets both domestic and foreign have tightened their quality expectations as well in addition other countries have limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards also in 2017 the chinese government began to limit the flow of material into the country by restricting the issuance of required import licenses the use of restrictions on import licenses to restrict flow into china continued in 2018 and is expected to continue in 2019 the current us presidential administration has made substantial changes to foreign trade policy and imposed increases in tariffs on international trade in response china has imposed new tariffs on the import of recyclable commodities including wastepaper plastics and metals if the chinese government’s regulations and tariffs or initiatives or other similar regulations tariffs or initiatives result in further reduced demand or increased operating costs the profitability of our recycling operations may decline 

we have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycled commodities but it is possible there may not be sufficient demand for all of the material we produce resulting in price decreases and increased volatility the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively as we experienced in 2018 or positively as we experienced in 2017 and 2016 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 

the decline in market prices in 2018 for recycling commodities resulted in a decrease in revenue of 273 million the increase in market prices in 2017 and 2016 for recycling commodities resulted in increases in revenue of 237 million and 51 million respectively additionally under some agreements our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers in some cases if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for recycling commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated as we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall 

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products significant variations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in a corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our ees organization demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices such as the low prices throughout the last few years any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future 

 

changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas exploration production and disposal could adversely affect our ees organization 

our ees organization provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and these disposal services include the use of underground injection wells demand for these services may be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to regulation and industry conditions beyond our control in addition to changes in oil and gas prices there is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals there also remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production including ghg emissions or hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costprohibitive for our ees customers to continue operations adversely affecting our business 

additionally any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations including through the use of injection wells could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services conversely any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely impact demand for our ees services 

changes to the regulatory framework related to renewable fuel standards could affect our financial performance in that sector as a renewable fuel producer 

the company acts as a renewable fuel producer in the rfs program enacted by congress under the energy policy act and energy independence and security act oil refiners and importers are required through the rfs program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits referred to as rins from renewable fuel producers the company has invested and continues to invest in facilities to capture and treat renewable natural gas from the company’s landfills so that we can participate in the program the value of the rins associated with our landfill gas is set through a market established by the program changes in the rfs market or the structure of the rfs program could reduce the value of landfill gas rins and negatively impact the financial performance of the facilities constructed to capture and treat the gas 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and bans on certain types of waste could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

additionally with a heightened awareness of the global problems of plastic waste in the environment an increasing number of cities across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use bans on single use plastic bags straws and polystyrene food containers have been passed in over 350 cities and a ban on single use plastic bags has been implemented in the state of california these bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressure to ban the sale of those materials however there are currently no viable end markets for recycling these materials and 

 

inclusion of such materials in our recycling stream can increase contamination of the recycling stream and negatively affect the results of our recycling operations 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved and for conditions resulting from waste types or compounds previously considered nonhazardous but later determined to present possible threat to public health or the environment the risks of successor liability and emerging contaminants are of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their 

 

indemnification obligations owed to us any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 





we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which negatively impacts the ability to grow through new business or service upgrades and may result in customer turnover and reduction in customers’ waste service needs consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may also reduce the number and variety of services requested by customers additionally a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows 

a decrease in waste volumes generated results in an increase in competitive pricing pressure and such economic conditions may also interfere with our ability to implement our pricing strategy many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase more than the increase if any in the consumer price index this is partially due to our relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels and vendor costs which may not correlate with the consumer price index or the waste industry 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recycling commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

 

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2018 we had 705 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and 513 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis if market dynamics resulted in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we would incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally if fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally lawsuits have challenged our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins 

we have an extensive natural gas truck fleet which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet however natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in north america as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program 

 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to litigation risk 

substantially all aspects of our business operations rely on digital technology we use computers mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber intrusions and we must commit substantial resources to continuously monitor and further develop our networks and infrastructure to prevent detect and address the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be effective in all cases the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption direct financial loss negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential litigation and liability and competitive disadvantage 

further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk certain new technologies such as use of autonomous vehicles remotecontrolled equipment and virtual reality present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful would enhance organized labor’s leverage to obtain higher than expected wage and benefits costs and resist the introduction of new technology and other initiatives which can result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans “multiemployer pension plans” for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded 

 

vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal depending on various factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period we have previously withdrawn from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 3 million and 12 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2016 we did not recognize any charges for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans see notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills transfer stations mrfs and other disposal facilities involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures additionally we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability releases of hazardous materials and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters there may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate landfill gas and odors we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training compliance and response and recovery programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand additionally a major operational failure even if suffered by a competitor may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry with a corresponding increase in operating expense 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile 

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile and several other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by thirdparty rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 22 billion of debt as of december 31 2018 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program and our 275 billion revolving credit facility if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow 

we may use our 275 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in june 2023 as of december 31 2018 we had c15 million or 11 million of canadian borrowings outstanding borrowings under this facility we had 587 million of letters of credit issued and 990 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program both supported by this facility leaving unused and available credit capacity of 12 billion as of december 31 2018 in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v ghg tailoring rule which 

 

expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however if certain changes to these regulations were enacted such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs 

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather and climate conditions such as wildfires in the western us and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us during the second half of the year can increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time due to significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with us or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

from time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business we are also party to civil litigation as a large company with operations across the us and canada we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business actions that have been filed against us and that may be filed against us in the future include personal injury property damage commercial customer and employmentrelated claims including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to 







the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2018 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in item 1a risk   factors  the following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

overview 

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy we own or operate the largest network of landfills in north america in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity additionally we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services our “traditional solid waste” business excludes our recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the us 

 

our solid waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental fee fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business described under results of operations below 

business environment 

the waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry however customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills due to this we monitor these developments to adapt our services offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs 

despite some industry consolidation in recent years we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private service providers based on pricing service quality customer experience and breadth of service offerings we also encounter competition for acquisition and growth opportunities our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors as increases and decreases in consumer spending business expansions and construction starts generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and our revenues negative economic conditions in addition to competitor actions can make it more challenging to negotiate renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins and customers may reduce their service needs general economic factors and the market for consumer goods in addition to regulatory developments can also significantly impact commodity prices for recyclable materials we sell our operating expenses are directly impacted by volume levels as volume levels shift due to economic and other factors we must manage our network capacity and cost structure accordingly 

the generally favorable macroeconomic environment including steady spending by consumers and businesses and construction starts has benefited our volume growth and gross margins in recent quarters we are not expecting any significant shift in the near term but there is increased market volatility and uncertainty about longerterm macroeconomic indicators disruptions in the global movement of recycling commodities due in part to actions by the chinese government resulted in significantly lower average markets prices in 2018 compared to 2017 however we currently expect market price declines for recycling commodities to moderate in 2019 the recycling industry is continuing to adapt to the heightened quality standards and regulations in addition we are also focusing on managing processing costs developing alternative markets and educating customers to reduce contamination in the recycling stream 

current year financial results 

during 2018 we continued to produce strong operating results from our traditional solid waste business driven by strong yield and volume growth in our collection and disposal business net income and earnings per diluted share both increased primarily as a result of the strong operating results from our traditional solid waste business as well as the favorable impact on our effective tax rate due to enactment of tax reform the company continued its commitment to supporting both organic and inorganic growth during 2018 allocating 1694 million of available cash to capital expenditures and 466 million to the acquisition of solid waste businesses we also allocated 1806 million to our shareholders during 2018 through common stock repurchases and dividends 

 

key items of our 2018 financial results include 















results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business including both our wmsbs and ees organizations recycling brokerage services landfill gastoenergy services and certain other 

 

expanded service offerings and solutions these operations are presented in our “other” segment in the table below the following table summarizes revenues during the years ended december 31 in millions 



  

the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended december 31 in millions 







 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues and average yield dollars in millions 









the following provides further details about our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer and landfill operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to the types of services provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 291 million or 23 and 241 million or 20 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively we experienced growth in yield for all of our collection and disposal lines of business in both 2018 and 2017 the periodtoperiod changes are as follows dollars in millions 



  

our increase in collection and disposal yield for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 compared with the prior years includes increased revenues from our environmental fees of 74 million and 67 million respectively 

 

recycling commodities — fluctuations in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in revenue decline of 273 million and revenue growth of 237 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively as compared with the prior years disruptions in the global movement of recycling commodities began in september 2017 and continued throughout 2018 average market prices for recycling commodities at the company’s facilities were 40 lower in 2018 compared to 2017 we currently expect market prices for recycling commodities to moderate in 2019 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased 111 million and 73 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively as compared with the prior years these revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based market prices for diesel fuel increased 20 and 15 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively compared with the prior years the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations where we are the primary obligor in the contractual arrangement 

volume 

our revenues from volume increased 478 million or 33 and 289 million or 21 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively as compared with the prior years the comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions 

we experienced higher volumes throughout 2018 and 2017 due to our focus on customer service and disciplined growth combined with favorable market conditions in our traditional solid waste business we have experienced significant volume growth with existing customers particularly in our commercial collection business the volume growth is the result of proactive efforts taken to work with our customers as their businesses expand and grow to identify service upgrade opportunities contributors to our volume increase in both 2018 and 2017 included a large new contract addition in the second half of 2017 that continued to favorably impact volume growth for our commercial collection business into 2018 additionally a large contract executed in the second half of 2017 increased our volumes at our transfer stations with incremental volume additions during 2018 that will continue to favorably impact our volumes into 2019 the cleanup efforts of natural disasters throughout the us in the second half of 2017 favorably affected our landfill volumes primarily in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 2016 but negatively impacted the comparability of volumes for 2018 furthermore our wmsbs organization experienced favorable volume growth in both 2018 and 2017 

additionally a volume increase from our recycling brokerage services affected the comparability of volumes for 2018 and 2017 drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2017 and 2016 included a volume increase from an elevenmonth outage at a wastetoenergy facility in virginia that ended in middecember 2017 offset in part by one less workday in 2017 that negatively impacted our volume growth 

foreign currency translation and other 

fluctuations in foreign currency affect revenues from our canadian operations we also experienced revenue decline associated with the adoption of asu 201409 and other changes see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits costs excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business including certain rebates paid to suppliers vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill 

 

operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and x other operating costs which include gains and losses on sale of assets telecommunications equipment and facility lease expenses property taxes utilities and supplies 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 



  

the increase in volumes in the current year periods as discussed above in operating revenues  affect the comparability of operating expenses for the periods presented in addition cost inflation affects the comparability of operating expenses particularly between 2018 and 2017 

other s ignificant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by i volume growth in our collection line of business ii a bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention and iii merit increases the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was due to i merit increases ii increased headcount driven by higher volumes and iii charges for the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans these cost increases were partially offset by one less workday in 2017 

maintenance and repairs  — the increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2018 and 2017 as compared with the prior year periods was primarily driven by i higher labor costs from volume growth and cost inflation and ii higher thirdparty service and parts costs   

cost of goods sold — the decrease in cost of goods sold in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by i lower market prices for recycling commodities and ii a change in accounting for certain customer rebates due to the adoption of asu 201409 in the current year period see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of asu 2014‑09 the increase in cost of goods sold in 2017 as compared with 2016 was due to higher market prices for recycling commodities partially offset by lower costs due to i continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and ii the divestiture of a majorityowned organics company in 2016 

fuel — the increase in fuel costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was due to   higher market prices for diesel fuel partially offset by the recognition of a 28 million benefit from the extension of federal natural gas fuel credits we recognized the benefit in the first quarter of 2018 when the legislation was passed though the credits relate to 2017 business 

 

activity and these credits were not extended into 2018 the increase in fuel costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to i higher market prices for diesel fuel ii the expiration of certain natural gas fuel excise tax credits as of december 31 2016 and iii higher volumes in our collection line of business these cost increases were partially offset by i lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and ii reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — the decrease in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by the adoption of asu 201409 in the current year period specifically certain franchise fees were treated as disposal fees and taxes in the prior year periods and are treated as a reduction in operating revenues in the current year period see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of asu 201409 the increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2017 as compared with 2016 is primarily due to higher landfill volumes and increased municipal franchise fees 

risk management  — the increase in risk management costs in 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to increases in losses within our selfinsured retention 

other — the decrease in other operating costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by net gains on sales of certain assets in the current year period the increase in other operating costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was principally driven by favorable adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions in 2016 and higher operating lease expenses in 2017 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefits costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising bank charges computer costs travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 



  

significant items affecting the comparison of our selling general and administrative expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to i lower incentive compensation accruals in the current year period and ii severance costs for former executives incurred in 2017 partially offset by merit increases and a bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to i merit increases ii higher incentive compensation accruals and iii higher severance costs for former executives in 2017 

 

professional fees  — the increase in professional fees in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the investments we are making in technology to improve our operations and our customer service and higher legal fees 

provision for bad debts  — our provision for bad debts increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to i an increase in revenues and ii the bankruptcy of a strategic customer in our wmsbs organization 

other — the increase in other expenses in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to higher litigation settlements in 2018 which were partially offset by lower costs associated with advertising and travel and entertainment as we continued to focus on controlling costs  the increase in other expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2016 and charitable contributions made for hurricane relief efforts in 2017 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 



  

the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily due to increased capital expenditures to support organic growth in our business the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2018 and 2017 as compared with the prior year periods is primarily due to higher volumes at our landfills and changes in our landfill estimates 

gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net 

the following table summarizes the major components of gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net for the years ended december 31 in millions 



  

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized net gains of 58 million primarily related to i a 52 million gain associated with the sale of certain hauling operations in tier 1 and ii net gains of 44 million substantially all from divestitures of certain ancillary operations these gains were partially offset by i a 30 million charge to impair a landfill in tier 3 based on an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis taking into account continued volume decreases and revised capping cost estimates and ii 8 million of impairment charges primarily related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit  

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized net gains of 16 million primarily related to i gains of 31 million from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties and ii a 30 million reduction in postclosing performancebased contingent consideration obligations associated with an acquired business in our ees organization these gains were partially offset by i 34 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our ees organization ii 11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental 

 

remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in harris county texas as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and iii 7 million of charges to write down certain renewable energy assets 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized net charges of 112 million primarily related to i 44 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in harris county texas as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements ii a 43 million charge to impair a landfill in tier 3 due to a loss of expected volumes iii 12 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit and iv an 8 million loss on the sale of a majorityowned organics company

solid waste — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three years ended december 31 2018 are summarized below 

the following items affected both comparable periods 



in addition the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017 



in addition the following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016 



 

other — in 2018 compared with 2017 our other segment benefited from net gains from divestitures of certain ancillary operations and improved results in our ees and wm renewable energy businesses partially offset by higher risk management costs a reduction in contingent consideration obligations in our ees business favorably affected 2017 when compared with 2016 

corporate and other — corporate and other was affected by charges in 2016 and to a lesser extent in 2017 to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in harris county texas 

in addition the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017 



in addition the following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016 



interest expense net 

our interest expense net was 374 million 363 million and 376 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively our 2017 interest expense benefited from higher capitalized interest on certain projects under development and the early repayment of highcoupon senior notes and issuance of new senior notes at lower coupon interest rates in 2017 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

we recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of 41 million 68 million and 44 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the amount in 2017 includes impairment charges of 29 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their estimated fair values the remaining losses for each period are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility we generate tax benefits including tax credits from the losses incurred from these investments which are discussed further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

other net 

we recognized other net income of 2 million in 2018 compared to other net expense of 14 million and 54 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively the expenses for 2017 and 2016 were impacted by impairment charges of 11 million and 42 million respectively related to otherthantemporary declines in the value of minorityowned investments in waste diversion technology companies in addition we also recognized i 8 million of expense during 2016 associated with the termination of our crosscurrency swaps which is discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and ii a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 6 million and 4 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

income tax expense 

we recorded income tax expense of 453 million 242 million and 642 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively resulting in effective income tax rates of 190 110 and 352 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following 



 





see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2018 and 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2017 for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity as measured in tons of waste for the years ended december 31 and remaining capacity measured in cubic yards of waste as of december 31 in millions 









 

the tons received at our landfills are shown below tons in thousands 







when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our environmental legacy management group as of december 31 2018 our environmental legacy management group managed 207 closed landfills 

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2018 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 41 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes disposal prices construction and operating costs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions — landfills section below although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 43 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

the number of landfills owned or operated as of december 31 2018 segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 





as of december 31 2018 we have 16 landfills which are not currently accepting waste during the year ended december 31 2018 we performed tests of recoverability for seven of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of 270 million for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our 

 

probabilityweighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values we did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining nine landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was not material 

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended december 31 2018 are reflected in the table below 



  

as of december 31 2018 we estimate that we will spend approximately 600 million in 2019 and approximately 125 billion in 2020 and 2021 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

the changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended december 31 2018 are reflected in the table below in millions 





 







landfill operating costs — the following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended december 31 in millions 



  

amortization of landfill airspace  — amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses includes the following 





amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis for the years ended december 31 



  

different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 252 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company each year 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company consistently generates cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds its working capital needs the payments of its dividend and investment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities the company believes that its investment grade credit ratings large value of unencumbered assets and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital operating and other liquidity requirements 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 in millions 



aincludes 70 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our borrowings as of december 31 2018 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 were primarily attributable to i net debt cash borrowings of 313 million ii our recent federal lowincome housing investment discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and new capital leases which increased our debt obligations by 250 million and iii the impacts of other noncash changes in our debt balances such as divestitures debt issuance costs discounts premiums foreign currency translation and terminated interest rate derivatives 

as of december 31 2018 we had 19 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months including i 990 million of shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program ii 705 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities iii 161 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months including 106 million of taxexempt bonds and iv c15 million or 11 million of canadian borrowings under our 275 billion revolving credit facility  of the 990 million of shortterm borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2018 that are supported by our 275 billion revolving credit facility we have the intent and ability to refinance or maintain approximately 730 million of these borrowings on a longterm basis and we have classified these amounts as longterm debt as of december 31 2018 we have classified an additional 705 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months as longterm because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our 275 billion revolving credit facility as discussed below the remaining 432 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations   

 

as of december 31 2018 we also have 268 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit under our 275 billion revolving credit facility the interest rates on our variablerate taxexempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process all recent taxexempt bond remarketings have successfully placed company bonds with investors at marketdriven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful however if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we have the availability under our 275 billion revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully accordingly we have also classified these borrowings as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018  

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit categorized by type of facility as of december 31 in millions 







refinancing of revolving credit facility 

in june 2018 we entered into the 275 billion revolving credit facility which amended and restated our prior longterm us revolving credit facility amendments to the credit agreement included i increasing total capacity under the facility from 225 billion to 275 billion ii establishment of a 750 million accordion feature that may be used to increase total capacity in future periods iii extending the term through june   2023 and iv inclusion of two oneyear extension options waste management of canada corporation and wm quebec inc each an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of wm were added as additional borrowers under the 275 billion revolving credit facility and the agreement permits borrowing in canadian dollars up to the us dollar equivalent of 375 million with such borrowings to be repaid in canadian dollars wm holdings a whollyowned subsidiary of wm guarantees all of the obligations under the 275 billion revolving credit facility 

summary of cash flow activity 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions 





net cash provided by operating activities — our operating cash flows increased by 390 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared with the prior year period as a result of i higher earnings from our traditional solid waste business and ii lower income tax payments of 213 million driven by enactment of tax reform and timing of income tax payments partially offset by lower earnings from our recycling line of business 

our operating cash flows increased by 177 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared with the prior year period as a result of higher earnings from our traditional solid waste business and recycling line of business 

 

this increase is partially offset by cash paid for income taxes which was 120 million higher in 2017 largely driven by higher earnings and timing of income tax payments 

net cash used in investing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 









 

net cash used in financing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 





  



during 2018 we had 250 million of noncash financing activities from our recent federal lowincome housing investment discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and new capital leases during 2017 and 2016 we did not have any significant noncash investing and financing activities noncash investing and financing activities are generally excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments 





we announced in december 2018 that our board of directors has authorized up to 15 billion in future share repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations 



we paid aggregate cash dividends of 802 million 750 million and 726 million during 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 041 in 2016 to 0425 in 2017 and to 0465 in 2018 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program 

 

in december 2018 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0465 to 05125 per share for dividends declared in 2019 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans growth and acquisitions and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 



free cash flow 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities which is the most comparable gaap measure we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the years ended december 31 in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 





 

summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

















 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities longlived asset impairments and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace 

 

is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 









for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that 

 

expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

environmental remediation liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include prp investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 









longlived asset impairments 

we assess our longlived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards if necessary impairments are recorded in gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net in our consolidated statement of operations 

property and equipment including landfills and definitelived intangible assets — we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated 

 

permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded 

indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess the indefinitelived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using level 3 inputs 

beginning in 2018 we first performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value if the assessment indicated a possible impairment we completed a quantitative review comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill an impairment charge was recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount fair value is typically estimated using an income approach however when appropriate we may also use a market approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value is computed using several factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis however we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  — gain loss from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net and   note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

in december 2017 we elected to use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs we continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with thirdparty insurers in addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a whollyowned insurance captive we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of tax deductions related to these claims wm will pay an annual premium to the insurance captive typically in the first quarter of the year for the estimated losses based on the external actuarial analysis these premiums are held in a restricted escrow account to be 

 

used solely for paying insurance claims resulting in a transfer of risk from wm to the insurance captive and are allocated between current and longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets depending on timing on the use of funds 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2018 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting standard pending adoption 

leases — in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016‑02 associated with lease accounting there have been further amendments including practical expedients with the issuance of asu 201801 in january 2018 asu 201811 in july 2018 and asu 201820 in december 2018 the amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will also be required we elected the optional transition method which allows entities to continue to apply historical accounting guidance in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption 

at transition lessees and lessors may elect to apply a package of practical expedients permitting entities not to reassess i whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases ii lease classification for any expired or existing leases and iii whether initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases qualify for capitalization under the amended guidance these practical expedients must be elected as a package and consistently applied we have elected to apply the package of practical expedients upon adoption 

we identified our leases or other contracts impacted by the new standard and are currently in the process of i finalizing our implementation of a software solution to manage and account for leases under the new standard and ii updating our business processes and related policies systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard 

upon adoption of the amended guidance we expect to recognize rightofuse assets and related liabilities of approximately 300 million to 350 million for our contracts which contain an operating lease we currently do not expect the amended guidance to have any other material impacts on our consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2018 approximately 35 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates certain commodity prices and canadian currency rates from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks the company had no derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2018 

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities as of december 31 2018 we had 101 billion of longterm debt excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs discounts premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives we have 22 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of i 990 million of shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program ii 705 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months iii 513 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis and iv c15 million or 11 million of canadian borrowings under our 275 billion revolving credit facility we currently estimate that a 100‑basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2019 interest expense by 19 million 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our fixedrate taxexempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive debt instruments this analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous 100‑basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately 575 million as of december 31 2018 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis we also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in availableforsale securities including us treasury securities us agency securities municipal securities mortgage and assetbacked securities and equity securities 

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues may also increase or decrease 

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as certain support functions in india where significant we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income including operating revenue and operating expenses however the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations

 item 1 business 

general 

waste management inc is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wm” we are referring only to waste management inc the parent holding company 

wm was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wm and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wm wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries for details on the financial position results of operations and cash flows of wm wm holdings and their subsidiaries see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street houston texas 77002 our telephone number is 713 512‑6200 our website address is wwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10‑k quarterly reports on form 10‑q and current reports on form 8‑k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wm” 

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services our “traditional solid waste” business excludes our recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states “us” during 2017 our largest customer represented 1 of annual revenues we employed approximately 42300 people as of december 31 2017 

we own or operate 249 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in north america in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage 305 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada as well as other services that supplement our traditional solid waste business 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address the current needs while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs of our customers 

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive 

 

our fundamental strategy has not changed we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions the regulatory environment asset and resource availability and innovation through technology we believe that focused differentiation in our industry driven by capitalizing on our extensive wellplaced network of assets will deliver profitable growth and competitive advantages simultaneously we believe the combination of cost control process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations 

we believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program in december 2017 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0425 to 0465 per share for dividends declared in 2018 which is a 94 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2017 this is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows and marks the 15th consecutive year of dividend increases all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors 

operations 

general 

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 areas see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

the services we currently provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below the following table shows revenues contributed by these services for the years ended december 31 in millions 



  

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 



 



landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america as of december 31 2017 we owned or operated 244 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and thus thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer as of december 31 2017 we owned or operated 305 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally 

 

for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage we were the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling volumes singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing as of december 31 2017 we operated 90 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recycling commodities are recovered for resale 

recycling commodities — we market and resell recycling commodities globally we manage the marketing of recycling commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

recycling brokerage services  — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recycling commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recycling commodities with minimal capital requirements 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” in some cases rebates are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates but are generally based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers which are recorded as operating expenses within our consolidated statements of operations in recent years we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell 

other other services we provide include the following 

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts organization which is managed by our strategic business solutions “wmsbs” organization works with customers whose locations span the us our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs 

our energy and environmental services “ees” organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our ees organization but reflected principally in our collection line of business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection line of business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique 

 

ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy organization landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the us environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources as of december 31 2017 we had 127 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills for 102 of these projects the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 13 of these projects the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes for 12 of these projects the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology we also have expanded service offerings and solutions including portable selfstorage and long distance moving services fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ®  and street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of three national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive the industry’s national and regional competitors often face significant competitors in local markets we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

seasonal trends 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

employees 

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 42300 fulltime employees of which approximately 7900 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 8100 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity 

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii a whollyowned insurance captive the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our longterm us revolving credit facility “225 billion revolving credit facility” and other credit facilities established for that purpose 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation real and personal property directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy in december 2017 we elected to use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs as of december 31 2017 both our commercial general liability insurance policy and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2017 our automobile liability insurance program included a perincident deductible of up to 10 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2017 are summarized in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

we previously chose to maintain a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy that covered only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a during 2017 due to attractive pricing we converted to a traditional full coverage policy and subject to the terms of that policy the company is now insured for money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers in excess of applicable deductibles 

 

regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the us and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations with acquisition development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

in recent years we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry the current us presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the current administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the us the timing of any such changes or the impact of any such changes on our business reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve it is likely that some policies adopted by the current administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us it also appears that pending litigation has blunted the impact of deregulation for the immediate future 

the primary us federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 





 







the epa and the department of transportation finalized greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavyduty engines and vehicles – phase 2 on august 16 2016 the rule will increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions standards for our collection fleet between model years 2021 and 2027 we expect to be able to purchase fully compliant vehicles that will meet our operational needs and while the regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 



 

we are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in us federal regulations affecting our business 



further in june 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision that significantly limited the applicability and scope of epa permitting requirements for ghgs from stationary sources following this ruling the epa issued a policy memorandum in july 2014 advising that the us supreme court ruling effectively narrows the scope of biogenic carbon dioxide “co2” permitting issues that remain for the epa to address further on october 3 2016 the epa proposed revisions to the psd and title v ghg permitting regulations establishing a significant emissions rate “ser” of 75000 tons of co2 equivalent below which sources would not be required to implement additional control technologies for their ghg emissions this ser threshold should prevent most of our operational changes such as landfill expansions and beneficial gas recovery projects from being subject to psd or title v permit requirements due to our ghg emissions – assuming the epa classifies biogenic co2 emissions from municipal solid waste and landfill gas as carbon neutral the epa plans to finalize the rulemaking in 2018 the epa has not yet finalized its policy for addressing biogenic co2 emissions from waste management however the epa’s independent science advisory board has recommended it treat wastederived co2 emissions as carbonneutral the result of the us supreme court ruling and anticipated epa policy and regulatory action should significantly reduce the potential impact of the psd and title v ghg tailoring rule on our air permits compliance and operating requirements see item 1a risk factors  — the adoption   of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

other recent final and proposed rules to increase the stringency of certain national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” could affect the cost timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gastoenergy facilities however the epa under the current administration is reviewing the implementation of the new naaqs and considering revisions to make the regulations less stringent while we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of potential revisions to naaqs we do not believe that the ultimate requirements will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 

we continue to anticipate the needs of our customers which includes investing in and developing evermoreadvanced recycling and reuse technologies potential climate change ghg regulatory and corporate sustainability initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide lowcarbon services to our customers and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth if the us were to impose a carbon tax or other form of ghg regulation increasing demand for lowcarbon service offerings in the future the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable 





 



state provincial and local regulations 

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills the number of state and local governments with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could take and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations while fitness laws can present potential increased costs and barriers to 

 

entry into market areas these laws have not and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 

foreign import and export regulations 

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products a significant portion of the fiber that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe particularly china in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics and restrict the import of certain other plastic recyclables in 2017 the chinese government announced a ban on certain materials including mixed waste paper and mixed plastics effective january 1 2018 as well as extremely restrictive quality requirements effective march 1 2018 that will be difficult for the industry to achieve single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards also in 2017 the chinese government began to limit the flow of material into the country by restricting the issuance of required import licenses the use of restrictions on import licenses to restrict flow into china is expected to continue in 2018 additionally increased container weight tracking and port fees have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry and have resulted in increased price volatility the current us presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade restrictions and tariffs on exporting would have a significant impact on our recycling operations 

in recent years we have been revising our service agreements to address increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the public on the need to recycle properly we are investing time and labor and working with customers to help improve quality however there is uncertainty about the industry’s ability to adapt to the chinese government’s regulations we have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycled commodities but it is possible there may not be sufficient demand for all of the material we produce resulting in price decreases and volatility industry trade organizations and government agencies are engaged in discussions to mitigate longterm impacts to recycling programs and the industry as a whole 

hydraulic fracturing regulation 

our ees organization provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations there remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services on the other hand we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services 

emissions from natural gas fueling and infrastructure 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet as of december 31 2017 we were operating 6525 natural gas trucks and 106 natural gas fueling facilities of which 101 are in the us and five are in canadian provinces 29 of these fueling stations also serve the public or preapproved third parties concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles we have partnered with the environmental organization environmental defense fund as well as other heavyduty equipment users and experts on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers we anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavyduty fleet may ultimately help inform regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry additional regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax 

 

incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our future investment in natural gas vehicles 

federal state and local climate change initiatives 

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity despite the announcement that the us will withdraw from the paris climate accords we have seen no reduction in customer demand for services aligned with their ghg reduction goals and strategies 

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements containing 









you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2018 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of three national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive the industry’s national and regional competitors are often significant competitors in local markets we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —   overview for more information on our business strategy 

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

















 









in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

compliance with existing or increased future regulations andor enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the us and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 











regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals because of the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or thirdparty landfill operators among other reasons environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the 

 

permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the us congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the us congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the us and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in recent years we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry the current us presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the current administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the us the timing of any such changes or the impact of any such changes on our business reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company moreover the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve it is likely that some policies adopted by the current administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us 

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices and commodity prices for recyclable materials are particularly susceptible to volatility based on regulations that affect our ability to export products 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and plastics which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint and a significant portion of the fiber that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe particularly china in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics and restrict the import of certain other plastic recyclables in 2017 the chinese government announced a ban on certain materials including mixed waste paper and mixed plastics effective january 1 2018 as well as extremely restrictive quality requirements effective march 1 2018 that will be difficult for the industry to achieve single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards also in 2017 the chinese government began to limit the flow of material into the country by restricting the issuance of required import licenses the use of restrictions on import licenses to restrict flow into china is expected to continue in 2018 

there is uncertainty about the industry’s ability to adapt to the chinese government’s regulations we have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycled commodities but it is possible there may not be sufficient demand for all of the material we produce resulting in price decreases and increased volatility the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash flows positively as we 

 

experienced in 2017 and 2016 or negatively as we experienced in 2015 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 

the increase in market prices in 2017 and 2016 for commodities resulted in increases in revenue of 237 million and 51 million respectively the decline in market prices in 2015 for commodities resulted in a decrease in revenue of 138 million additionally under some agreements our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers in some cases if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for recycling commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated as we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall   if the chinese government’s regulations or other similar regulations or initiatives such as increased container weight tracking and port fees or restrictions and tariffs on exporting result in reduced demand or increased operating costs such regulations initiatives restrictions and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our recycling operations 

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products significant variations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in a corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our ees organization demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices such as the low prices throughout the last few years any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future 

changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our ees organization 

ees organization demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control in addition to changes in oil and gas prices changes in laws or government regulations regarding ghg emissions from oil and gas operations andor hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers there remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 





we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index additionally a prolonged economic downturn in china could significantly impact prices for postconsumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recycling commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2017 we had 831 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and 328 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process which is prior to their scheduled maturities if market dynamics resulted in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we would incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally if fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally lawsuits have challenged our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins 

we have an extensive natural gas truck fleet which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet however natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in north america as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings 

 

additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to litigation risk 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential litigation and liability and competitive disadvantage 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful would enhance organized labor’s leverage to obtain higher than expected wage and benefits costs and resist the introduction of new technology and other initiatives which can result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans “multiemployer pension plans” for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal depending on various factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 12 million and 51 million in 2017 and 2015 respectively in 2016 we did not recognize any charges for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans see notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures additionally we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability releases of hazardous materials and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters there may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing 

 

elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate landfill gas and odors we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training compliance and response and recovery programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand additionally a major operational failure even if suffered by a competitor may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry with a corresponding increase in operating expense 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile 

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile as well as a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by thirdparty rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 18 billion of debt as of december 31 2017 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds and outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program and our canadian term loan if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow 

we may use our 225 billion revolving credit facility and our c50 million canadian revolving credit facility “canadian revolving credit facility” to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in july 2020 and march 2019 respectively as of december 31 2017 we had 642 million of letters of credit issued and 515 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program both supported by our 225 billion revolving credit facility leaving unused and available credit capacity of 1093 million and we had no outstanding borrowings under both our 225 billion revolving credit facility and canadian revolving credit facility in the event of a default under our credit facilities we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v ghg tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however if certain changes to these regulations were enacted such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs 

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the areas affected on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with us or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

from time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business we are also party to civil litigation as a large company with operations across the us and canada we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business actions that have been filed against us and that may be filed against us in the future include personal injury property damage commercial customer and employmentrelated claims including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to 







the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results   of operations 

this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2017 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in item 1a risk   factors  the following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

overview

key items of our 2017 financial results include 









 





our business performed exceptionally well in 2017 as our strategy of improving pricing adding profitable volume and controlling costs led to another year of significant earnings improvement our focus on delivering exceptional customer service while bolstering employee engagement yielded consistently positive operational performance throughout the year our cash flow generation has also continued to exceed expectations allowing us to invest in assets that support continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation and return 15 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in 2017 the success that we achieved in 2017 reinforces our foundation for earnings and cash flow growth in 2018 despite anticipated disruption and downward price pressure in the global market for recycling commodities with the reduction in our cash taxes due to enactment of tax reform we are investing in our frontline employees technology and revenue generating assets to continue to grow our business and improve customer service these investments together with our longheld commitments to maintain a strong balance sheet return cash to shareholders and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities position the company to capitalize on its momentum as we work to deliver superior performance again in 2018 

the following explanations of certain items that affected the comparability of the years presented has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2017 results were affected by the following 







our 2016 results were affected by the following 



free cash flow 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash 

 

provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities which is the most comparable gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity nonetheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the years ended december 31 in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 





our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by 174 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with 2016 impacted by i higher earnings from our traditional solid waste and recycling businesses and ii favorable changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures these increases were partially offset by i higher income tax payments of 120 million in 2017 ii cash proceeds of 67 million from the termination of our crosscurrency swaps in 2016 and iii higher annual incentive plan cash payments of 41 million in 2017 

our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by 478 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared with 2015 impacted by i higher earnings from our traditional solid waste and recycling businesses ii cash proceeds of 67 million from the termination of our crosscurrency swaps in 2016 iii multiemployer pension plan settlement payments of approximately 60 million in 2015 and iv lower annual incentive plan cash payments of 46 million in 2016 partially offset by higher income tax payments of 23 million in 2016 additionally we experienced favorable changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures particularly nontrade related items including payroll and incentive accruals 

capital expenditures increased by 170 million when comparing 2017 with 2016 and 106 million when comparing 2016 with 2015 the company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management and fluctuations in our capital expenditures are a result of new business opportunities growth in our existing business timing of replacement of aging assets and investment in assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation 

acquisitions 

southern waste systemssun recycling   “sws”  — on january 8 2016 waste management inc of florida an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of wm acquired certain operations and business assets of sws in southern florida for total consideration of 525 million the acquired business assets include residential commercial and industrial solid waste collection processingrecycling and transfer operations equipment vehicles real estate and customer agreements 

deffenbaugh disposal inc   “deffenbaugh”  — on march 26 2015 we acquired deffenbaugh one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest for total consideration net of cash acquired of 400 million deffenbaugh’s assets include collection operations transfer stations recycling facilities and landfills 

 

adoption of new accounting standards 

equitybased compensation — in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 2016‑09 associated with equitybased compensation as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance with gaap while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided this amended guidance was effective for the company on january 1 2017 and required the following changes to the presentation of our financial statements 











goodwill impairment testing — in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 2017‑04 which simplifies the goodwill impairment test by eliminating step 2 of the quantitative assessment and should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment under the amended guidance when a quantitative assessment is required an entity will perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an impairment charge will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s estimated fair value not to exceed the total amount of recorded goodwill this amended guidance effective for the company on january 1 2020 permits early adoption the company’s early adoption on january 1 2017 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities longlived asset impairments and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 





 





for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 15 landfill sites with expansions included as of december 31 2017 three landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace one landfill required approval by our chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining two landfills required approval because the permit application process did not meet the one or fiveyear requirements 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

environmental remediation liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include prp investigations settlements and certain legal 

 

and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 









longlived asset impairments 

we assess our longlived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards if necessary impairments are recorded in income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net in our consolidated statement of operations 

property and equipment including landfills and definitelived intangible assets — we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess the indefinitelived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using level 3 inputs 

we assess whether an impairment exists using a quantitative assessment our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount fair value is typically estimated using an income approach however when appropriate we may also use a market approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value is computed using several factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis however we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  — income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net and   note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

in december 2017 we elected to use a whollyowned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs we continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with thirdparty insurers in addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a whollyowned insurance captive we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of tax deductions related to these claims wm will pay an annual premium to the insurance captive typically in the first quarter of the year comprised of equal parts cash and an intercompany note for the estimated losses based on the external actuarial analysis these premiums will be held in a restricted escrow account to be used solely for paying insurance claims resulting in a transfer of risk from wm to the insurance captive 

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or mrf 

 

and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business including both our wmsbs and ees organizations recycling brokerage services landfill gastoenergy services and expanded service offerings and solutions our expanded service offerings and solutions include i portable selfstorage and long distance moving services ii fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program iii portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ® and iv street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties these operations are presented in our “other” segment in the table below the following table summarizes revenues during the years ended december 31 in millions 



  

the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended december 31 in millions 







 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions 











our revenues increased 876 million or 64 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared with the prior year driven primarily by i higher volumes ii revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal lines of business iii higher market prices for the recycling commodities we sell and iv higher revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to higher diesel fuel prices 

our revenues increased 648 million or 50 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared with the prior year driven by i acquisitions primarily the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 ii revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal lines of business iii higher volumes and iv higher market prices for the recycling commodities we sell partially offsetting these revenue increases were i lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to lower diesel fuel prices ii divestitures and iii foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our canadian operations 

the following provides further details about our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer and landfill operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and 

 

disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to the types of services provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 241 million or 20 and 267 million or 24 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively we experienced growth in yield for all of our collection and disposal lines of business in both 2017 and 2016 the periodtoperiod changes are as follows dollars in millions 



  

our increase in collection and disposal yield for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 compared with the prior years includes increased revenues from our environmental fees of 67 million and 72 million respectively 

recycling commodities — increases in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in revenue growth of 237 million and 51 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as compared with the prior years due to the increase in the market prices of the recycling commodities we sell at our recycling facilities and through our recycling brokerage business however beginning in september 2017 disruptions in the global movement of recycling commodities and the impact of natural disasters along the gulf coast decreased market prices for recycling commodities which reduced our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with the prior year period we expect these disruptions in the market for recycling commodities to extend through the first half of 2018 which will continue to put downward pressure on average market prices for recycling commodities 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased 73 million for the year ended december 31 2017 and decreased 67 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared with the prior years these revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based market prices for diesel fuel increased 15 for the year ended december 31 2017 and decreased 14 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared with the prior years the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to passthrough fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these fees did not have a significant impact on the comparability of the periods presented 

volume 

our revenues from volume increased 289 million or 21 and 186 million or 14 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as compared with the prior years the comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions 

we experienced higher volumes due to improving market conditions and strong sales performance our focus on customer service and disciplined growth delivered consistent results throughout 2017 and 2016 the most significant contributors to our volume growth were commercial and industrial collection municipal solid waste and construction and demolition landfills and transfer stations our residential line of business experienced volume declines in 2017 and 2016 due to our continued focus on renegotiating existing contracts and winning only those new contracts with a reasonable rate of return 

 

additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2017 to 2016 are as follows 











additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2016 to 2015 are as follows 





acquisitions and divestitures 

acquisitions increased revenues 48 million and 268 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as compared with the prior years the increase in revenues in 2016 was principally due to the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 these revenues were partially offset by revenue decreases due to divestitures of 27 million and 30 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as compared with the prior years 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits costs excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling business including rebates paid to suppliers vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include telecommunications equipment and facility lease expenses property taxes utilities and supplies 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 



  

our operating expenses increased 535 million or 63 when comparing 2017 with 2016 and 255 million or 31 when comparing 2016 with 2015 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 623 in 2017 624 in 2016 and 635 in 2015 

significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was due to i merit increases ii increased headcount driven in part by higher volumes and iii charges for the withdrawal from certain multiemployer pension plans these cost increases were partially offset by one less workday in 2017 

the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2016 as compared with 2015 was due to i merit increases ii additional costs associated with the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 iii health and welfare cost increases iv an additional workday in 2016 and v higher incentive compensation accruals these cost increases were partially offset by i 51 million of charges in 2015 for the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans and ii lower headcount and contract labor costs in 2016 due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business 

transfer and disposal costs — the increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by higher volumes the increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by acquisitions primarily sws and higher volumes 

maintenance and repairs  — the increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by i higher thirdparty repairs and parts costs and ii higher labor costs due to increased headcount merit increases and retention and training efforts the increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily driven by i higher labor and parts and supplies costs and ii acquisitions primarily the acquired operations of sws 

subcontractor costs  — increases in subcontractor costs in 2017 compared with 2016 were driven by higher volumes in our solid waste business and our wmsbs organization the increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by acquisitions and higher volumes in our wmsbs organization the increases for both years were partially offset by a decrease in subcontracted remediation and construction services to industrial customers 

cost of goods sold — the increase in cost of goods sold in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to higher market prices for recycling commodities partially offset by lower costs due to i continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and ii the divestiture of a majorityowned organics company in 2016 the increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to i higher market prices for recycling commodities and ii increased costs in our remediation and construction services business partially offset by lower costs due to continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers 

 

fuel — the increase in fuel costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to i higher fuel prices ii the expiration of certain natural gas fuel excise tax credits as of december 31 2016 and iii higher volumes in our collection line of business these cost increases were partially offset by i lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and ii reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet the decrease in fuel costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by i lower fuel prices ii lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles iii increases in natural gas fuel excise credits and iv reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet the higher volumes in our collection line of business in 2016 partially offset these decreases 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — the increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2017 compared with 2016 is primarily due to higher landfill volumes and increased municipal franchise fees the increase in 2016 compared with 2015 is primarily due to i higher landfill volumes ii increased municipal franchise fees and iii increased subcontracted remediation and construction services to industrial customers 

landfill operating costs  — the most significant item impacting landfill operating costs for the periods presented was landfill leachate management costs which were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 and higher in 2016 compared to 2015 

risk management  — the increase in risk management costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to increases in certain uninsured losses the decrease in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to a reduction in certain uninsured losses and to a lesser extent decreased workers’ compensation claims 

other  — the changes in other operating costs in the reported periods were principally driven by favorable adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions in 2016 and fluctuations in operating lease expenses operating lease expenses were higher in 2017 compared with 2016 and lower in 2016 when compared with 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefits costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising bank charges computer costs travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 



  

our selling general and administrative expenses increased 58 million or 41 when comparing 2017 with 2016 and 67 million or 50 when comparing 2016 with 2015 our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 101 in 2017 and 104 in 2016 and 2015 

 

significant items affecting the comparison of our selling general and administrative expenses between reported periods include 

labor and related benefits  — the increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to i merit increases ii an increase in certain costs that vary with revenue and earnings growth including incentive compensation accruals and iii higher severance costs for former executives in 2017 the increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to i higher incentive compensation accruals ii merit increases iii higher severance costs and iv acquisitions 

professional fees  — the decrease in professional fees in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to lower legal fees 

other  — the increase in other expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2016 and charitable contributions made for hurricane relief efforts in 2017 the decrease in other expenses in 2016 compared with 2015 was principally driven by favorable litigation settlements and lower bank charges 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses include i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 40 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life using either a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 



  

the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2017 as compared with the prior year is primarily due to higher volumes at our landfills and changes in our landfill estimates 

the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets during 2016 as compared with the prior year is primarily due to the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2016 as compared with the prior year is due to higher volumes at our landfills partially offset by changes in our landfill estimates

the following table summarizes the major components of income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items net for the years ended december 31 in millions 



  

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized net income of 16 million primarily related to i gains of 31 million from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties and ii a 30 million reduction in postclosing performancebased contingent consideration obligations associated with an acquired business in our ees organization these gains were partially offset by i 34 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our ees organization ii 11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in harris county texas as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and iii 7 million of charges to write down certain renewable energy assets

the following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016 







the following items affected 2016 when compared with 2015 









interest expense net 

our interest expense net was 363 million 376 million and 385 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively during 2017 the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher capitalized interest on certain projects under development and the early repayment of highcoupon senior notes and issuance of new senior notes at lower coupon interest rates in 2017 during 2016 the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the impact of lower market interest rates on certain of our taxexempt bonds partially offset by increased borrowings under our 225 billion revolving credit facility 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

loss on early extinguishment of debt was 6 million 4 million and 555 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the amount for 2015 was primarily associated with the early extinguishment of almost 2 billion of our highcoupon senior notes through makewhole redemption and cash tender offers we replaced substantially all of the debt extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon interest rates and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations the loss on early extinguishment of debt reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for 2015 includes 122 million of charges related to makewhole redemptions and 430 million of charges related to cash tender offers 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

we recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of 68 million 44 million and 38 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the amount in 2017 includes impairment charges of 29 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their estimated fair values the remaining losses for each period are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in lowincome housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in income tax expense refer to notes 8 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments 

other net 

we recognized other net expense of 8 million 50 million and 7 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the expenses for 2017 2016 and 2015 were impacted by impairment charges of 11 million 42 million and 5 million respectively related to otherthantemporary declines in the value of minorityowned investments in waste diversion technology companies in addition we recognized 8 million of expense during 2016 associated with the termination of our crosscurrency swaps which is discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

income tax expense 

we recorded income tax expense of 242 million 642 million and 308 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively resulting in effective income tax rates of 110 352 and 291 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years presented is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes as discussed above ii impacts of enactment of tax reform iii federal tax credits iv excess tax benefits associated with equitybased compensation transactions v the tax implications of impairments vi the realization of state net operating losses and credits vii adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes and viii tax audit settlements the impacts of these items are summarized below 





 













based on current tax laws and regulations as modified by the act effective january 1 2018 we expect our 2018 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 260 based on projected income before income taxes federal tax credits and other permanent items the estimated 2018 rate incorporates the benefit of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 as well as the impacts of other less material provisions included in the act 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2017 and 243 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of december 31 2016 for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity as measured in tons of waste for the years ended december 31 and remaining capacity measured in cubic yards of waste as of december 31 in millions 





 





the tons received at our landfills in 2017 and 2016 are shown below tons in thousands 







when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2017 our closed sites management group managed 204 closed landfills 

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2017 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 43 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes disposal prices construction and operating costs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions — landfills section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

 

the number of landfills owned or operated as of december 31 2017 segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 





as of december 31 2017 we have 15 landfills which are not currently accepting waste during the year ended december 31 2017 we performed tests of recoverability for seven of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of 282 million for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values we did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining eight landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was immaterial 

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended december 31 2017 are reflected in the table below 



  

as of december 31 2017 we estimate that we will spend approximately 400 million in 2018 and approximately 1 billion in 2019 and 2020 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by 

 

conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

the changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended december 31 2017 are reflected in the table below in millions 







landfill operating costs — the following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended december 31 in millions 





amortization of landfill airspace  — amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses includes the following 





amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event 

 

and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis for the years ended december 31 



  

different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 249 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company each year 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at our mrfs iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v final capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt payment of interest and discharging of other obligations and vii capital expenditures acquisitions and investments in assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 in millions 



  

we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our borrowings as of december 31 2017 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2016 to december 31 2017 were primarily attributable to i net debt borrowings of 172 million and ii the impacts of other noncash changes in our debt balances due to debt issuance costs discounts premiums foreign currency translation and terminated interest rate derivatives 

as of december 31 2017 the current portion of our longterm debt balance of 739 million includes i 515 million of shortterm borrowings under our commercial paper program and ii 224 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months including 167 million of taxexempt bonds 

we have 831 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and an additional 328 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit the interest rates on our variablerate taxexempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process all recent taxexempt bond remarketings have successfully placed company bonds with investors at marketdriven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful however if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we have the intent and ability to refinance these bonds on a longterm basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our 225 billion revolving credit facility accordingly we have classified these borrowings as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit categorized by type of facility as of december 31 in millions 







summary of cash flow activity 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions 





net cash provided by operating activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2017 as compared with 2016 are summarized below 



 









the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared with 2015 are summarized below 













net cash used in investing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 





 







net cash used in financing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 





  

during 2017 we had 452 million of noncash financing activities due to the initial funding of a whollyowned insurance captive and taxexempt bond borrowings during 2016 and 2015 we did not have any significant noncash investing and financing activities noncash investing and financing activities are generally excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments 





 

we paid 750 million 725 million and 600 million for common stock repurchases during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we announced in december 2017 that the board of directors has authorized up to 125 billion in future share repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations 



we paid aggregate cash dividends of 750 million 726 million and 695 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 0385 in 2015 to 041 in 2016 and to 0425 in 2017 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program 

in december 2017 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0425 to 0465 per share for dividends declared in 2018 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 





summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions

new accounting standards pending adoption 

income taxes  — in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016‑16 associated with the timing of recognition of income taxes for intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory the amended guidance requires the recognition of income taxes when the transfer of the asset occurs which replaces current gaap that defers the recognition of income taxes until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2018 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

statement of cash flows — in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016‑15 associated with the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016‑18 associated with the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows the objective of both amendments was to reduce existing diversity in practice the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2018 and upon adoption the principal change for the company will be in the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows which will include substantially all of the restricted trust and escrow accounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 

financial instrument credit losses  — in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016‑13 associated with the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments the amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses 

 

and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2020 with early adoption permitted beginning january 1 2019 we are assessing the provisions of this amended guidance and evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

leases  — in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016‑02 associated with lease accounting the amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will also be required the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2019 we are assessing the provisions of this amended guidance and we have i formed an implementation work team ii performed training for the various organizations that will be most affected by the new standard and iii acquired a software solution to manage and account for leases under the new standard we are evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

financial instruments  — in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016‑01 associated with the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities the amended guidance will require certain equity investments that are not consolidated and not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2018 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  — in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 2014‑09 associated with revenue recognition the amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts the amended guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the company on january 1 2018 the amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented “full retrospective method” or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption “modified retrospective method” the company is currently planning to adopt the amended guidance using the modified retrospective method as of january 1 2018 

to assess the impact of the standard we utilized internal resources to lead the implementation effort and supplemented them with external resources our internal resources read the amended guidance attended trainings and consulted with other accounting professionals to assist with interpretation of the amended guidance surveys were sent to and returned by all operating segments to assess the potential impact of the amended guidance and to tailor specific procedures to evaluate the potential impact based on the results of these surveys we judgmentally selected a sample of contracts based on size and specifically identified contract traits that could be accounted for differently under the amended guidance we also selected a representative sample of contracts to corroborate the survey results 

based on our work to date we believe we have identified all material contract types and costs that may be impacted by this amended guidance we currently do not expect the amended guidance to have a material impact on operating revenues however upon adoption of the amended guidance certain sales incentives will be capitalized and amortized to selling general and administrative expenses over the expected life of the customer relationship under current guidance sales incentives are expensed as earned to selling general and administrative expenses additionally the amended guidance resulted in a change in who we identify as a customer for certain arrangements we anticipate payments to these customers will be a reduction in operating revenues under current guidance these payments are recorded as operating expenses 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2017 approximately 35 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm 

 

agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates certain commodity prices and canadian currency rates from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks the company had no derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2017 

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities as of december 31 2017 we had 95 billion of longterm debt excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs discounts premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives we have 18 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of i 831 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire within the next 12 months ii 515 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program iii 328 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process and iv 113 million of outstanding borrowings under our canadian term loan we currently estimate that a 100‑basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2018 interest expense by 15 million 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our fixedrate taxexempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive debt instruments this analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous 100‑basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately 635 million as of december 31 2017 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less we also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in fixedincome securities including us treasury securities us agency securities municipal securities and mortgage and assetbacked securities we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis 

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues may also increase or decrease 

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as certain support functions in india where significant we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income including operating revenue and operating expenses however the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services our “traditional solid waste” business excludes our recycling and resource recovery services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states in december 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants during 2016 our largest customer represented 1 of annual revenues we employed approximately 41200 people as of december 31 2016 

we own or operate 248 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in north america in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage 310 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the united states and canada as well as other services that supplement our traditional solid waste business 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address the current needs while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs of our customers we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the

our fundamental strategy has not changed we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions the regulatory environment asset and resource availability and current technology we believe that focused differentiation in our industry driven by capitalizing on our extensive wellplaced network of assets will deliver profitable growth and competitive advantages simultaneously we believe the combination of cost control process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations 

we believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and common stock repurchases in december 2016 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 041 to 0425 per share for dividends declared in 2017 which is a 37 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2016 this is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows and marks the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors 

operations 

general 

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 areas see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments in december 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this divestiture we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

we have expanded certain of our operations through acquisitions which are discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in january 2016 waste management inc of florida a whollyowned subsidiary of wm acquired certain operations and business assets of southern waste systemssun recycling “sws” in southern florida the acquired business assets include residential commercial and industrial solid waste collection processingrecycling and transfer operations equipment vehicles real estate and customer agreements in march 2015 we acquired deffenbaugh disposal inc “deffenbaugh” one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest with assets including collection operations transfer stations recycling facilities and landfills 

 

index to financial statements the services we currently provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for the years ended december 31 

 

 collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

 landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2016 we owned or operated 243 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and as a result thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated 

 

index to financial statements margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer at december 31 2016 we owned or operated 310 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage we were the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling volumes singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing at december 31 2016 we operated 95 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale 

 

index to financial statements commodities recycling — we market and resell recyclable commodities globally we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

recycling brokerage services — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” in some cases rebates are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates but are generally based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers which are recorded as “operating expenses” within our consolidated statements of operations in recent years we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell 

other other services we provide include the following 

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts organization which is managed by our strategic business solutions organization works with customers whose locations span the united states our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs 

our energy and environmental services organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our energy and environmental services organization but reflected principally in our collection business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy organization landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the us environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2016 we had 131 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills for 103 of these projects the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 16 of these projects the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes for 11 of these projects the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers for one of these projects the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel 

 

index to financial statements we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology we also offer portable selfstorage and long distance moving services through a joint venture fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ®  and street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties 

wheelabrator on december 19 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business to an affiliate of energy capital partners and received cash proceeds of 195 billion net of cash divested subject to certain postclosing adjustments we recognized a gain of 519 million on this sale which is included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” in the consolidated statement of operations in conjunction with the sale the company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain wheelabrator facilities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these agreements 

wheelabrator provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants our wheelabrator business was a separate reportable segment until the sale of the business in 2014 as discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of three national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive the industry’s national and regional competitors are often significant competitors in local markets we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

seasonal trends 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other 

 

index to financial statements hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern united states can increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other unusual event occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

employees 

at december 31 2016 we had approximately 41200 fulltime employees of which approximately 7800 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 8000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity 

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii a whollyowned insurance subsidiary national guaranty insurance company of vermont the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our longterm us revolving credit facility “225 billion revolving credit facility” and other credit facilities established for that purpose 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2016 our commercial general liability insurance policy carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 25 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2016 our automobile liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 5 million subject to an additional deductible of 48 million in the 5 million to 10 million layer we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2016 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage often referred to as “side b” the side a policy covers directors and officers directly for loss including defense costs when corporate indemnification is unavailable side aonly coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the company as the company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers 

 

index to financial statements regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

in recent years we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry however the new united states presidential administration has called for substantial changes to areas of federal tax and foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the united states the timing of any such changes or the impact of any such changes on our business while reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company it is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

  

  

index to financial statements   

  

 should the epa or the court not address our legal and technical concerns in the final rules we will reassess the capital and operating cost impact to our operations however we do not believe that the ultimate regulatory changes would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 

additionally emission and fuel economy standards have been imposed on manufacturers of transportation vehicles including heavyduty waste collection vehicles the epa and the department of transportation finalized greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavyduty engines and vehicles — phase 2 on august 16 2016 the rule will increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions standards for our collection fleet between model years 2021 

 

index to financial statements and 2027 however we expect to be able to purchase fully compliant vehicles that will meet our operational needs the regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet but we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 

 

 we are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in united states federal regulations affecting our business 

 

 in june 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision that significantly limited the applicability and scope of epa permitting requirements for ghgs from stationary sources concluding that the epa may not treat ghgs as an air pollutant for purposes of determining whether a source is required to obtain a psd or title v permit and the epa can continue to require that psd permits otherwise required based on emissions of conventional pollutants contain limitations on ghg emissions based on best available control technology “bact” following this ruling the epa issued a policy memorandum in july 2014 advising that the us supreme court ruling effectively narrows the scope of biogenic co 2 permitting issues that remain for the epa to address further on october 3 2016 the epa proposed revisions to the psd and title v ghg permitting regulations and proposed establishing a significant emissions rate “ser” of 75000 tons of co 2 equivalent below which sources would not be required to implement additional control technologies for their ghg emissions this ser threshold should prevent most of our operational changes such as landfill expansions and beneficial gas recovery projects from being subject to psd or title v permit requirements due to our ghg emissions – assuming the epa classifies biogenic co 2 emissions as carbon neutral the epa has not yet finalized the rulemaking nor has it addressed how it will exempt biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from wastederived feedstocks municipal solid waste and landfill gas from psd and title v air permitting the epa nonetheless anticipates basing this proposal on the rationale that those emissions are likely to have minimal or no net atmospheric contributions or may even reduce such impacts when compared to an alternate method of disposal these conclusions have been recommended to the epa by its independent science advisory board as a result of the us supreme court ruling and the epa policy and proposed regulatory action we continue to believe the potential impact of the psd and title v ghg tailoring rule on our air permits compliance and results of operations is significantly reduced 

other recent final and proposed rules to increase the stringency of certain national ambient air quality standards such as the ozone rule finalized in october 2015 and related psd incrementsignificance thresholds could affect the cost timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gastoenergy facilities in general controlling emissions involves installing collection wells in a landfill and routing the gas to a suitable 

 

index to financial statements energy recovery system or combustion device as of december 31 2016 we had 131 projects at owned or operated landfills where landfill gas was captured and utilized for its renewable energy value rather than flared efforts to curtail the emission of ghgs and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls with associated capital or operating costs however we do not believe that such regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole see item 1a risk factors — the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

the epa clarified in its november 19 2014 policy memorandum that states may rely on wastederived biogenic feedstocks in their future proposed compliance plans required by the final clean power plan rules and the proposed federal plan both published in october 2015 which may create new or expanded opportunities for renewable energy projects according to the epa the federal plan would fill any gaps pending implementation of state or tribal plans to achieve required emissions reductions but would no longer apply when a state or tribal plan is approved 

we are taking steps to anticipate the future needs of our customers which include investing in and developing evermoreadvanced recycling and reuse technologies potential climate change and ghg regulatory initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide lowcarbon services to our customers and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth if the united states were to impose a carbon tax or other form of ghg regulation increasing demand for lowcarbon service offerings in the future the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable 

 

  

  

index to financial statements state provincial and local regulations 

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills the number of state and local governments with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the united states and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the united states or canada however state provincial and local governments could take and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

foreign import and export regulations 

enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products a significant portion of the fiber that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe 

 

index to financial statements particularly china in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” as well as increased container weight tracking and port fees have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry additionally the new presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade restrictions and tariffs on exporting would have a significant impact on our recycling operations 

single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs despite increased costs associated with export requirements we believe we are well positioned among our potential competitors to respond to and comply with such regulations in recent years we have been revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle properly 

hydraulic fracturing regulation 

our energy services line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations there remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services on the other hand we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services 

emissions from natural gas fueling and infrastructure 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet as of december 31 2016 we were operating 95 natural gas fueling facilities 28 of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties in 31 states and three canadian provinces concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles we have partnered with the environmental organization environmental defense fund as well as other heavyduty equipment users and experts on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers we anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavyduty fleet may ultimately help inform regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry additional regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our future investment in natural gas vehicles 

federal state and local climate change initiatives 

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel 

 

index to financial statements we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity 

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events 




 item 1a risk factors 

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements containing 

 

  

  

  

 you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2017 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of three national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts in recent years the industry has seen some additional consolidation though the industry remains intensely competitive the industry’s national and regional competitors are often significant competitors in local markets we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer 

 

index to financial statements needs these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview for more information on our business strategy 

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

index to financial statements  in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

compliance with existing or increased future regulations andor enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals because of the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or thirdparty landfill operators among other reasons environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation 

 

index to financial statements authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in the united states and canada epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the united states or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in recent years we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry however the new united states presidential administration has called for substantial changes to areas of federal tax and foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation including environmental regulation we cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the united states the timing of any such changes or the impact of any such changes on our business while reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company it is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us 

enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products a significant portion of the fiber that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe particularly china in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry particularly for single stream mrfs single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs additionally the new presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade if operation green fence or other similar initiatives such as increased container weight tracking and port fees new regulations or restrictions and tariffs on exporting increase our operating costs in the future and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers such initiatives regulations restrictions and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and plastics which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint and the price fluctuations for these commodities could be impacted by significant changes in united states foreign trade policy and increased tariffs on international trade as chinese paper mills are the primary consumer of the fiber we market the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash 

 

index to financial statements flows positively as we experienced in 2016 or negatively as we experienced in 2015 and 2014 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the increase in market prices in 2016 for commodities resulted in a yearoveryear increase in revenue of 51 million the decline in market prices in 2015 and 2014 for commodities resulted in yearoveryear decreases in revenue of 138 million and 53 million respectively additionally under some agreements our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers in some cases if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for recycling commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated as we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall 

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products significant variations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our energy services business demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices such as the pronounced price decreases beginning in late 2014 and continuing low prices throughout 2015 and 2016 any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future 

changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our energy services business 

energy services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control in addition to changes in oil and gas prices changes in laws or government regulations regarding ghg emissions from oil and gas operations andor hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers there remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide and together with our divested wastetoenergy facilities have historically provided our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

 

index to financial statements developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us 

 

index to financial statements additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

 we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index additionally a prolonged economic downturn in china could significantly impact prices for postconsumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

 

index to financial statements in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2016 we had 491 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and 473 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally if fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally we have recently settled cases that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices and we continue to face similar claims see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins 

we have an extensive natural gas truck fleet which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet however natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in north america as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price 

 

index to financial statements and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to litigation risk 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential litigation and liability and competitive disadvantage 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans “multiemployer pension plans” for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in 

 

index to financial statements the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal depending on various factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 51 million in 2015 and 4 million in 2014 see notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures additionally we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability releases of hazardous materials and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters there may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate landfill gas and odors we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training compliance and response and recovery programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand additionally a major operational failure even if suffered by a competitor may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry with a corresponding increase in operating expense 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty 

 

index to financial statements insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile 

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile as well as a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by thirdparty rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 16 billion of debt as of december 31 2016 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility and canadian term loan if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow 

we may use our 225 billion revolving credit facility and our c50 million canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in july 2020 and march 2019 respectively at december 31 2016 we had 426 million of outstanding borrowings and 789 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the 225 billion revolving credit facility leaving unused and available credit capacity of 1035 million and we had no outstanding borrowings under the canadian revolving credit facility in the event of a default under our credit facilities we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do 

 

index to financial statements additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however if certain changes to these regulations were enacted such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs 

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern united states can increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other unusual event occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

 

index to financial statements currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

from time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business we are also party to civil litigation as a large company with operations across the united states and canada we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business actions that have been filed against us and that may be filed against us in the future include personal injury property damage commercial customer and employmentrelated claims including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to 

 

  

  

 the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2016 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

overview 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address the current needs while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs of our customers we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive 

our fundamental strategy has not changed we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions the regulatory environment asset and resource availability and current technology we believe that focused differentiation in our industry driven by capitalizing on our extensive wellplaced network of assets will deliver profitable growth and competitive advantages simultaneously we believe the combination of cost control process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations 

we believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry 

notable items of our 2016 financial results include 

 

  

  

  

index to financial statements   

  

  

 the company had a very successful 2016 exceeding expectations and carrying forward our momentum from 2015 by generating strong earnings and cash flow our commitment to executing on our strategies of disciplined profitable volume growth and controlling costs through focused differentiation and continuous improvement drove these impressive results in 2016 and have built a strong foundation to produce solid earnings and generate further growth in 2017 this growth combined with our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet supports the company’s continued focus on investing in our business paying dividends pursuing attractive opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions and considering the market for share repurchases 

the following explanations of certain items that affected the comparability of the years presented has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2016 results were affected by the following 

 

 our 2015 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

 free cash flow 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of 

 

index to financial statements refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity nonetheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 

 

 when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016 to the comparable period in 2015 the increase of 462 million is primarily related to i higher earnings from our traditional solid waste business ii cash proceeds of 67 million from the termination of our crosscurrency swaps in the first quarter of 2016 iii trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plan “multiemployer pension plan” settlement payments of approximately 60 million in 2015 and iv lower annual incentive plan cash payments of 46 million in the current year partially offset by higher income tax payments net of excess tax benefits associated with equitybased transactions of 36 million in the current year additionally we experienced net favorable changes in our assets and liabilities net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures particularly nontrade related items including payroll and incentive accruals 

when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015 to 2014 the increase of 167 million is primarily related to i lower income tax payments net of excess tax benefits associated with equitybased transactions of 329 million in 2015 ii lower interest paid of 77 million in 2015 and iii the settlement of forwardstarting swap liabilities of 36 million in 2014 these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in cash earnings due to the sale of our wheelabrator business in 2014 ii multiemployer pension plan settlement payments of approximately 60 million in 2015 and iii higher yearoveryear annual incentive plan payments of approximately 65 million in 2015 finally we experienced net unfavorable changes in our assets and liabilities net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures particularly nontrade related items including payroll and incentive accruals 

capital expenditures increased by 106 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and by 82 million in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in our capital expenditures in both years is generally the result of additional spending on new business opportunities and acquisitions growth in our existing business and asset replacement timing in addition the construction of a wastewater treatment facility at one of our landfills also contributed to the increase in 2016 although we experienced capital expenditure increases in both 2016 and 2015 the company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management 

the significantly higher proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 is largely driven by the 2014 sales of i our wheelabrator business for 195 billion ii our investment in shanghai environment group which was part of our wheelabrator business for 155 million and iii our puerto rico operations for consideration of 80 million including 65 million in cash 

 

index to financial statements acquisitions 

southern waste systems sun recyclin g “sws” — on january 8 2016 waste management inc of florida a whollyowned subsidiary of wm acquired certain operations and business assets of sws in southern florida for total consideration of 525 million the acquired business assets include residential commercial and industrial solid waste collection processingrecycling and transfer operations equipment vehicles real estate and customer agreements 

deffenbaugh disposal inc “deffenbaugh” — on march 26 2015 we acquired deffenbaugh one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest for total consideration net of cash acquired of 400 million deffenbaugh’s assets include collection operations transfer stations recycling facilities and landfills 

divestitures 

wheelabrator business — on december 19 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business to an affiliate of energy capital partners and received cash proceeds of 195 billion net of cash divested subject to certain postclosing adjustments we recognized a gain of 519 million on this sale which is included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 net adjustments to this gain were immaterial on a pretax basis in conjunction with the sale the company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain wheelabrator facilities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these agreements 

other — in addition to the divestiture of our wheelabrator business we also divested our puerto rico operations as well as certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in 2014 

in total these divested businesses and assets provided 018 of diluted earnings per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2014 

adoption of new accounting standards 

debt issuance costs — in april 2015 and as subsequently amended the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued amended authoritative guidance associated with debt issuance costs which were previously presented as assets related to recognized debt liabilities the amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs other than those costs related to line of credit arrangements be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability which is similar to the presentation for debt discounts and premiums this guidance was effective for the company on january 1 2016 the company’s adoption of this guidance was applied retrospectively and resulted in a reclassification of 52 million of such costs in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 

consolidation — in february 2015 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with consolidation the amended guidance makes changes to existing consolidation requirements associated with the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities including limited partnerships and variable interest entities the guidance was effective for the company on january 1 2016 the company’s adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty 

 

index to financial statements relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities longlived asset impairments deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an 

 

index to financial statements expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

 for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 16 landfill sites with expansions included at december 31 2016 three landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace because the permit application process did not meet the one or fiveyear requirements 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to 

 

index to financial statements higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

environmental remediation liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

  

  

 longlived asset impairments 

we assess our longlived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards if necessary impairments are recorded in the “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our consolidated statement of operations 

property and equipment including landfills and definitelived intangible assets — we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less 

 

index to financial statements than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions — expansion airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit 

goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using level 3 inputs 

we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we will not perform a quantitative assessment 

if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit the first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment fair value is typically estimated using an income approach however when appropriate we may also use a market approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value is computed using several factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis however we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable 

 

index to financial statements see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods 

indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 

when performing the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired if it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value 

fair value is typically estimated using an income approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business 

fair value is computed using several factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis however we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of these assets is reasonable 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes should interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection transfer disposal and recycling and resource recovery services and from sales of commodities by our recycling 

 

index to financial statements and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or mrf and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business including both our strategic business solutions “wmsbs” and energy and environmental services organizations recycling brokerage services landfill gastoenergy services and expanded service offerings and solutions we also offer portable selfstorage and long distance moving services fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ®  and street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties these operations are presented as “other” in the table below our wheelabrator business divested in december 2014 provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants the following table summarizes revenues during the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

  

index to financial statements the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions 

 

  

   

  

 our revenues increased 648 million or 50 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the prior year driven by i acquisitions primarily the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 ii revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations iii higher volumes and iv higher market prices for the recycling commodities we sell partially offsetting these revenue increases were i lower revenues from our fuel surcharges program due to lower yearoveryear diesel fuel prices ii divestitures and iii foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our canadian operations 

our revenues decreased 1035 million or 74 for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year driven by i divestitures in 2014 principally our wheelabrator business our puerto rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area ii lower volumes iii lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to declining diesel fuel prices iv lower market prices for the recycling commodities we sell and v foreign currency translation partially offsetting these revenue declines were 

 

index to financial statements i revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations and ii revenue from acquired operations primarily the acquired operations of deffenbaugh in march 2015 

the following provides further details about our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer and landfill operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to the types of services provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 267 million or 24 and 203 million or 18 for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we experienced growth in yield for all of our collection and disposal lines of business in both 2016 and 2015 the details are as follows dollars in millions 

 

 revenues from our environmental fee contributed 72 million and 17 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively to our collection and disposal average yield 

recycling commodities — our revenues increased 51 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared with the prior year period due to a 7 yearoveryear increase in the market prices for the recycling commodities we sell at our recycling facilities and through our recycling brokerage services during 2015 revenues declined by 138 million as compared with the prior year due to a 12 yearoveryear decline in recycling commodities prices 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program decreased 67 million and 171 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively these revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based market prices for diesel fuel decreased approximately 14 in 2016 and 30 in 2015 which caused the decline in fuel surcharge revenues in 2016 and 2015 the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to passthrough fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these fees did not have a significant impact on the comparability of the periods presented 

 

index to financial statements volume 

our revenues increased 186 million or 14 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared with the prior year due to higher volumes the yearoveryear comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions as discussed below we experienced higher volumes in all of our collection and disposal lines of business with the exception of our residential line of business as a result of i improving market conditions ii reduced customer churn and improved sales performance supported by our focus on disciplined growth and iii an additional workday in 2016 

additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2016 to 2015 are as follows 

 

  

 declines in our volumes caused our revenue to decrease 215 million or 16 for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared with the prior year we experienced lower volumes in i our collection line of business primarily due to competition and our pricing strategies ii our mrfs primarily driven by the rationalization of our underperforming assets and our strategy to not renew municipal contracts that did not reflect current market conditions and iii our ancillary services businesses primarily due to the loss of certain large accounts in our wmsbs organization and lower oil prices which negatively affected both our oil and gas producing properties and our oilfield services business these decreases in volumes were partially offset by increases in the municipal solid waste business driven by new business and improving market conditions that favorably affected our landfill and transfer lines of business 

acquisitions and divestitures 

revenues increased 268 million and 174 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as compared with the prior year periods due to acquisitions the increase in revenues in 2016 was principally due to the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 the revenue increase in 2015 was principally due to the acquired operations of deffenbaugh in march 2015 

these revenues were offset by revenue decreases of 30 million and 762 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as compared with the prior year periods due to divestitures the decrease in revenues in 2015 was primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014 of our wheelabrator business our puerto rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling business including rebates paid to suppliers vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill 

 

index to financial statements lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include telecommunications equipment and facility rent property taxes utilities and supplies 

our operating expenses increased 255 million or 31 when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased 771 million or 86 when comparing 2015 with 2014 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 624 in 2016 635 in 2015 and 643 in 2014 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between periods reported include 

labor and related benefits — the increase in labor and related benefits in 2016 as compared with 2015 was due to i higher wages due to merit increases ii additional costs associated with the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 iii health and welfare cost increases iv an additional workday in 2016 and v higher incentive compensation costs these cost increases were partially offset by i 51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans and ii lower headcount and contract labor costs in 2016 due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business 

the decrease in labor and related benefits in 2015 as compared with 2014 was due to i reduced costs of 88 million due to the divestitures in 2014 of our wheelabrator business our puerto rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area ii lower headcount and contract labor costs due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business and lower volumes in our collection line of business and iii lower health and welfare costs these cost decreases were partially offset by i 51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans ii higher wages due to merit increases and iii additional costs associated with the acquired operations of deffenbaugh in march 2015 

transfer and disposal costs — the increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by acquisitions primarily sws and our overall increase in volumes the increase in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to incurring thirdparty costs for services previously provided on an intercompany basis prior to the divestiture of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 these cost increases were partially offset by 53 million in reduced costs due to the divestitures in 2014 

 

index to financial statements maintenance and repairs — the increase in maintenance and repairs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by i higher labor and parts and supplies costs and ii acquisitions primarily the acquired operations of sws the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was largely driven by a 177 million decrease due to the divestitures in 2014 which was partially offset by increased costs related to the acquired operations of deffenbaugh 

subcontractor costs — the increase in subcontractor cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by i acquisitions and ii higher volumes in our wmsbs organization these increases were partially offset by a decrease in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by i volume decreases in our wmsbs organization and ii lower landfill and recycling costs these decreases were partially offset by an increase in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers 

cost of goods sold — the increase in cost of goods sold in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to i higher market prices for recycling commodities and ii increased costs in our remediation services business partially offset by lower costs due to continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to i lower market prices for recycling commodities ii lower costs of 81 million due to the 2014 divestitures iii increased efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and iv ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around inbound quality control 

fuel — the decrease in fuel costs in 2016 and 2015 when compared to the prior year periods was driven by i lower fuel prices ii lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles iii yearoveryear increases in natural gas fuel excise credits and iv reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet the increase in collection volumes in 2016 partially offset these decreases 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — the increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to i higher landfill volumes and ii increased municipal franchise fees and subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers the decrease when comparing 2015 to 2014 is primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014 

landfill operating costs — the increase in landfill operating costs when comparing 2016 to 2015 is primarily due to higher leachate management costs leachate management costs have increased because in certain parts of the country we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment facilities the thirdparty fees charged for treatment of waste water have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased

higher leachate transportation and disposal costs also affected the comparison of our landfill operating costs for 2015 and 2014 though the increased costs were more than offset by the impact of 2014 divestitures and discount rate adjustments as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we record adjustments to our landfill operating costs for changes in us treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 

risk management — the decrease in costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a reduction in certain uninsured losses and to a lesser extent decreased workers’ compensation claims 

other — the decrease in costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily related to lower rental costs and favorable adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was principally driven by a decrease of 63 million due to the divestitures in 2014 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefits which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation 

 

index to financial statements ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising bank charges computer costs travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses increased 67 million or 50 when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased 138 million or 93 when comparing 2015 with 2014 our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 104 in 2016 104 in 2015 and 106 in 2014 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 significant factors affecting our expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 include 

labor and related benefits — the increase in labor and related benefits was primarily due to i higher incentive compensation costs ii merit increases iii higher severance costs and iv acquisitions 

professional fees — the decrease in professional fees was primarily due to lower legal fees 

other — the decrease in other expenses was principally driven by favorable litigation settlements and lower bank charges 

the divestitures in 2014 primarily the sale of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 favorably affected all cost categories when comparing expenses in 2015 to 2014 in addition to the impact of divestitures other significant factors affecting our expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 include 

labor and related benefits — the decrease in labor and related benefits was due to i cost savings from our august 2014 reorganization and ii lower incentive compensation costs which were partially offset by merit increases 

other — the decrease in other expenses was principally driven by lower litigation settlement costs and our continued focus on controlling costs 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses include i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 40 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is 

 

index to financial statements consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life using either a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 the increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets during 2016 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the acquired operations of sws in january 2016 the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2016 as compared to the prior year is due to increased volumes at our landfills partially offset by changes in our landfill estimates 

the decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the december 2014 sale of our wheelabrator business as discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased volumes a portion of which relates to the acquisition of deffenbaugh in march 2015 this increase was partially offset by favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates 

restructuring costs 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 4 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 2 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized 15 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 10 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs including costs associated with the loss of a municipal contract in our eastern canada area and our acquisition of deffenbaugh the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

in august 2014 we announced a consolidation and realignment of several corporate functions to better support achievement of the company’s strategic goals including cost reduction voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations approximately 650 employees separated from our corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized a total of 82 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized

the following table summarizes the major components of income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized net charges of 112 million primarily related to i 44 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in harris county texas as further discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements ii a 43 million charge to impair a landfill in western pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes iii 12 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our lamptracker ® reporting unit and iv an 8 million loss on the sale of a majorityowned organics company 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized net charges of 82 million primarily related to i 66 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties as a result of the continued decline in oil and gas prices ii 18 million of charges to write down or divest certain assets in our recycling operations and iii a 5 million impairment of a landfill in our western canada area due to revised postclosure cost estimates partially offsetting these charges was 7 million in net gains from divestitures including a 6 million gain on the sale of an oil and gas producing property in 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized net gains of 160 million primarily related to the following

 wheelabrator — the most significant item affecting the results of operations of our wheelabrator business in 2014 was a 519 million gain on sale of this business in december 2014 

interest expense net 

our interest expense net was 376 million in 2016 385 million in 2015 and 466 million in 2014 during 2016 the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the impacts of lower market interest rates on certain of our taxexempt bonds partially offset by increased borrowings under our 225 billion revolving credit facility during 2015 the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the refinancing of a significant portion of our highcoupon senior notes as a result of the combination of makewhole redemptions of certain senior notes cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of 18 billion of new senior notes we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

loss on early extinguishment of debt was 4 million and 555 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively the amount for 2015 was primarily associated with the early extinguishment of almost 2 billion of our highcoupon senior notes through makewhole redemption and cash tender offers we replaced substantially all of the debt extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon interest rates and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations the “loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for 2015 includes 122 million of charges related to makewhole redemptions and 430 million of charges related to cash tender offers 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

we recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of 44 million 38 million and 53 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively these losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in lowincome housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in provision for income taxes refer to notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments the amount in 2014 includes charges of 11 million primarily to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value 

other net 

we recognized other net expense of 50 million 7 million and 29 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the expenses for 2016 2015 and 2014 were impacted by impairment charges of 42 million 5 million and 22 million respectively related to otherthantemporary declines in the value of minorityowned cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies in addition we recognized 8 million of expense during the first quarter of 2016 associated with the termination of our crosscurrency swaps which is discussed further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded provisions for income taxes of 642 million 308 million and 413 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively these tax provisions resulted in effective income tax rates of 352 291 and 236 for the 

 

index to financial statements years ended 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes as discussed above ii federal tax credits iii tax audit settlements iv the realization of state net operating losses and credits v adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes and vi the tax implications of impairments and divestitures the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 based on current tax laws and regulations we expect our 2017 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 365 based on projected income before income taxes federal tax credits and other permanent items 

noncontrolling interests 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was 2 million in 2016 and 1 million in 2015 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 40 million in 2014 the income for 2014 was principally related to thirdparties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies “llcs” that owned three wasteto 

 

index to financial statements energy facilities operated by our wheelabrator business in december 2014 we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the llcs from the third parties the llcs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestiture of our wheelabrator business refer to notes 19 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the sale of our wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities respectively 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 243 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2016 and 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2015 for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity as measured in tons of waste for the years ended december 31 and remaining capacity measured in cubic yards of waste at december 31 in millions 

 

  

    

index to financial statements the tons received at our landfills in 2016 and 2015 are shown below tons in thousands 

 

  

  when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2016 our closed sites management group managed 213 closed landfills 

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2016 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes disposal prices construction and operating costs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 16 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions — landfills section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 47 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

the number of landfills owned or operated as of december 31 2016 segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

  

  

index to financial statements as of december 31 2016 we have 15 landfills which are not currently accepting waste we performed tests of recoverability for eight of these landfills and during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a 43 million charge to impair one of these landfills in western pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes for the other seven landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of 281 million the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values we did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining seven landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was immaterial 

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended december 31 2016 are reflected in the table below 

 

 as of december 31 2016 we estimate that we will spend approximately 400 million in 2017 and approximately 900 million in 2018 and 2019 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

 

index to financial statements the changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended december 31 2016 are reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 landfill operating costs — the following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

  

 amortization of landfill airspace — amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

 amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis for the years ended december 31 

 

  

index to financial statements different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 248 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v final capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt payment of interest and discharging of other obligations and vii capital expenditures acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 in millions 

 

 we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our borrowings as of december 31 2016 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 were primarily attributable to i net debt borrowings of 375 million and ii the impacts of other noncash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps foreign currency translation discounts premiums and deferred loan costs 

as of december 31 2016 the current portion of our longterm debt balance of 417 million includes i 230 million of shortterm borrowings under our longterm 225 billion revolving credit facility and ii 

 

index to financial statements 187 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months including 126 million of taxexempt bonds 

as of december 31 2016 we have classified 196 million of borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility as longterm because we intend and have the ability to refinance or maintain these borrowings on a longterm basis we generally use available cash to repay borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility and any remaining balances are maintained by extending the maturities of the borrowings our current projections indicate that we will maintain 196 million of the 426 million of borrowings outstanding for the next 12 months the remaining 230 million of borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016 

as of december 31 2016 we also have 473 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and an additional 491 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit the interest rates on our variablerate taxexempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process all recent taxexempt bond remarketings have successfully placed company bonds with investors at marketdriven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful however if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we have the intent and ability to use availability under our 225 billion revolving credit facility to fund the debt obligations until they can be remarketed successfully accordingly we classified these borrowings as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016

we announced in december 2016 that the board of directors has authorized up to 750 million in future share repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations 

 

 we paid aggregate cash dividends of 726 million 695 million and 693 million during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 0375 in 2014 to 0385 in 2015 and to 041 in 2016 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program 

in december 2016 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 041 to 0425 per share for dividends declared in 2017 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant

income taxes — in october 2016 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the timing of recognition of income taxes for intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory the amended guidance requires the recognition of income taxes when the transfer of the asset occurs which replaces current us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” that defers the recognition of income taxes until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2018 with early adoption permitted we are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance however we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

statement of cash flows — in august 2016 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows in november 2016 the fasb issued additional guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows the objective of both amendments was to reduce existing diversity in practice the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2018 with early adoption permitted we are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance however we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

financial instrument credit losses — in june 2016 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments the amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2020 with early adoption permitted beginning january 1 2019 we are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements 

stock compensation — in march 2016 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with stockbased compensation as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance with gaap while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided the amended guidance changes both the accounting and financial reporting for certain income tax impacts of stockbased compensation all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be required to be recognized as an income tax benefit or provision rather than as a component of equity the guidance also provides for changes in the calculation of forfeitures related to the expense of stockbased compensation the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2017 the adoption of this amended guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

leases — in february 2016 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with lease accounting the amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will also be required the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted we are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 

 

index to financial statements financial instruments — in january 2016 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities the amended guidance will require certain equity investments that are not consolidated to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2018 with early adoption permitted we are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition — in may 2014 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition the amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts the amended guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the company on january 1 2018 the amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented “full retrospective method” or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption “modified retrospective method” 

to assess the impact of the standard we utilized internal resources to lead the implementation effort and supplemented them with external resources our internal resources read the amended guidance attended trainings and consulted with nonauthoritative groups to assist with interpretation of the amended guidance surveys were sent to and returned by all operating segments to assess the potential impact of the amended guidance and to tailor specific procedures to evaluate the potential impact based on the results of these surveys we judgmentally selected a sample of contracts based on size and specifically identified contract traits that could be accounted for differently under the amended guidance we also selected a representative sample of contracts to corroborate the survey results we have completed our preliminary review of all contracts and are in the process of compiling and summarizing the results to determine whether additional review and analysis is necessary 

based on our work to date we believe we have identified all material contract types and costs that may be impacted by this amended guidance we expect to quantify and disclose the expected impact if any of adopting this amended guidance in the third quarter form 10q while we are still evaluating the impact of the amended guidance we currently do not expect it to have a material impact on operating revenues 

upon adoption of the amended guidance we anticipate recognizing an asset from the capitalization of sales incentives as contract acquisitions costs under the amended guidance sales incentives will be capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship currently the company expenses approximately 65 million in sales incentives annually as noted above we are still evaluating other possible impacts on our consolidated financial statements including potential changes in the classification of certain revenue streams currently reported on a gross basis and on our disclosures the company is also currently planning to adopt the amended guidance using the modified retrospective method as of january 1 2018 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2016 approximately 30 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks the company had no derivatives outstanding at december 31 2016 

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities as of december 31 2016 we had 94 billion of longterm debt excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives discounts premiums and debt issuance costs we have 16 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months our variablerate debt obligations include i 491 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process ii 473 million of tax exempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire within the next 12 months iii 426 million of borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility and iv 239 million of borrowings outstanding under our canadian term loan we currently estimate that a 100basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2017 interest expense by approximately 15 million 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our fixedrate taxexempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive debt instruments this analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous 100basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately 595 million at december 31 2016 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the shortterm maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues may also increase or decrease 

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as certain support functions in india and investments in hong kong where significant we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income including operating revenue and operating costs however the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations historically we hedged a portion of our foreign currency risk using currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions in march 2016 we terminated our crosscurrency swaps at termination we received 67 million in cash for the fair value of the hedged position and reported this amount as a component of “net cash provided by operating activities” in the consolidated statement of cash flows the realized loss from the termination did not materially affect our results of operations refer to notes 8 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives and translation

general 

the financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation waste management’s whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which waste management or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries as described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements waste management is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wm” we are referring only to waste management inc the parent holding company 

wm was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wm and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wm wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries for detail on the financial position results of operations and cash flows of wm wm holdings and their subsidiaries see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street houston texas 77002 our telephone number is 713 5126200 our website address is wwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wm” 

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer recycling and resource recovery and disposal services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states in december 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants during 2015 our largest customer represented 1 of annual revenues we employed approximately 40600 people as of december 31 2015 

we own or operate 249 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in north america in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage 297 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic and metal we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada as well as other services that supplement our traditional solid waste business 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are 

 

index to financial statements becoming more complex and our aim is to address and anticipate the current expanding and evolving needs of our customers accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive drawing on our resources and experience we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry the customers and communities we serve and the environment 

we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry to extract more value from the materials we manage and to innovate and optimize our business we plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from operational improvements and focused differentiation in our industry driven by capitalizing on our extensive wellplaced network of assets while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations 

in pursuit of these longterm goals we recognize that we must grow the business and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible accordingly we are focusing on the following five key company priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and common stock repurchases in december 2015 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0385 to 041 per share for dividends declared in 2016 which is a 65 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2015 this will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the 13 th consecutive year and is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors 

operations 

general 

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 geographic areas see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments in december 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our divestiture we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

 

index to financial statements we have expanded certain of our operations through acquisitions which are discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in march 2015 we acquired deffenbaugh disposal inc “deffenbaugh” one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest with assets including five collection operations seven transfer stations two recycling facilities one subtitled landfill and one construction and demolition landfill in january 2013 we acquired greenstar llc “greenstar” an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities this acquisition provides the company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions having supplemented the company’s extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers in july 2013 we acquired substantially all of the assets of rci environnement inc “rci” the largest waste management company in quebec and certain related entities rci provides collection transfer recycling and disposal operations throughout the greater montreal area the acquired rci operations complement and expand the company’s existing assets and operations in quebec 

the services we currently provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years presented 

 

 collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

 landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2015 we owned or operated 244 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the 

 

index to financial statements largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and as a result thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer at december 31 2015 we owned or operated 297 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

wheelabrator on december 19 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business to an affiliate of energy capital partners and received cash proceeds of 195 billion net of cash divested subject to certain postclosing 

 

index to financial statements adjustments we recognized a gain of 519 million on this sale which is included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” in the consolidated statement of operations in conjunction with the sale the company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain wheelabrator facilities these agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments with certain market price resets through 2021 

wheelabrator provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants our wheelabrator business was a separate reportable segment until the sale of the business in the fourth quarter of 2014 as discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements we concluded that the sale of our wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under then current authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the longterm waste supply agreements referred to above and in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage we were the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we operated 104 mrfs and 126 mrfs respectively where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale the decrease in mrfs is primarily due to the recycling rationalization efforts during 2015 

commodities recycling — we market and resell recyclable commodities globally to our customers we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

recycling brokerage services — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” in some cases rebates are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates but are generally based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers which are recorded as “operating expenses” within our consolidated statements of operations in recent years we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell 

other other services we provide include the following 

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts program which is managed by our strategic business solutions organization works with customers whose locations span the united states our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service 

 

index to financial statements billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs 

our energy and environmental services organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our energy and environmental services organization but reflected principally in our collection business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the us environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2015 we had 136 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 122 of our solid waste landfills and four thirdparty landfills at 108 of these landfills the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 16 landfills the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at 11 landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers at one landfill the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel 

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology we also offer portable selfstorage and long distance moving services through a joint venture fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ®  and street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste 

 

index to financial statements collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

seasonal trends 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

employees 

at december 31 2015 we had approximately 40600 fulltime employees of which approximately 7400 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 8200 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity 

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii whollyowned insurance subsidiary national guaranty insurance company of vermont the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our longterm us revolving credit facility “225 billion revolving credit facility” and other credit facilities established for that purpose 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability business interruption and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance 

 

index to financial statements claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2015 our commercial general liability insurance policy carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 25 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2015 our auto liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 5 million subject to additional deductibles of 48 million in the 5 million to 10 million layer we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2015 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage often referred to as “side b” the side a policy covers directors and officers directly for loss including defense costs when corporate indemnification is unavailable side aonly coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the company as the company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers 

regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us environmental protection agency “epa” environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue 

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below

index to financial statements   

 we are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in united states federal regulations affecting our business 

 

  

  

  

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

 state provincial and local regulations 

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

 

index to financial statements our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills the number of state and local governments with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in canada and the us epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

foreign import regulation 

enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry particularly for single stream mrfs single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs despite these increased costs we believe we are well positioned among our potential competitors to respond to and comply with such regulations we are revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle properly 

 

index to financial statements hydraulic fracturing regulation 

our energy services line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations there remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services on the other hand we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services 

emissions from natural gas fueling and infrastructure 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet as of december 31 2015 we were operating 84 natural gas fueling facilities 28 of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties in 30 states and three canadian provinces concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles we have partnered with the environmental organization environmental defense fund as well as other heavyduty equipment users and experts on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers we anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavyduty fleet may ultimately help inform regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry additional regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our future investment in natural gas vehicles 

federal state and local climate change initiatives 

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity 

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events 




 item 1a risk factors 

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often 

 

index to financial statements identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements containing 

 

  

  

  

 you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2016 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview for more information on our business strategy 

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

 

  

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

compliance with existing or future regulations andor enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

index to financial statements   

  

  

 regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility or epr are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in canada and the us epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry particularly for single stream mrfs single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs if operation green fence or other similar initiatives or 

 

index to financial statements new regulations increase our operating costs in the future and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and plastics which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities particularly demand from chinese paper mills can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively such as we experienced in 2015 2014 and 2013 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the decline in market prices in 2015 2014 and 2013 for commodities resulted in yearoveryear decreases in revenue of 138 million 53 million and 79 million respectively additionally under some agreements our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers in some cases if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated as we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall until market conditions improve 

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products significant variations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our energy services business demand for these services may decrease if drilling activity slows due to changes in oil and gas prices such as the pronounced price decreases in late 2014 and 2015 any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future 

changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our energy services business 

energy services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control in addition to changes in oil and gas prices changes in laws or government regulations regarding ghg emissions from oil and gas operations andor hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers there remains heightened attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition many state and local governments mandate diversion recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste food waste and electronics at landfills where such organic waste is not 

 

index to financial statements banned from the landfill some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide and together with our divested wastetoenergy facilities have historically provided our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

 

index to financial statements our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

 we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index additionally a prolonged economic downturn in china could significantly impact prices for postconsumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations 

 

index to financial statements some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2015 we had 491 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and 316 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally if fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally we recently agreed on settlement terms for two cases that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices and we may face similar claims in the future see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins 

 

index to financial statements we have an extensive natural gas truck fleet which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices 

we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet however natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in north america as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention 

 

index to financial statements and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the event of our withdrawal from multiemployer pension plan we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal depending on various factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 51 million in 2015 4 million in 2014 and 5 million in 2013 see notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures additionally we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability releases of hazardous materials and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters there may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface chemical reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate landfill gas and odors we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training compliance and response and recovery programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand additionally a major operational failure even if suffered by a competitor may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry with a corresponding increase in operating expense 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

 

index to financial statements in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile 

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile as well as a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by third party rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 911 million of debt as of december 31 2015 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility and canadian term loan if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow 

 

index to financial statements we may use our 225 billion revolving credit facility and our c150 million canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in july 2020 and november 2017 respectively as of december 31 2015 we had 20 million of outstanding borrowings and 831 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the 225 billion revolving credit facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1399 million and we had no outstanding borrowings under the canadian revolving credit facility in the event of a default under our credit facilities we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however if certain changes to these regulations were enacted such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs 

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events and “onetime” special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt 

 

index to financial statements practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

in december 2015 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0385 to 041 per share for dividends declared in 2016 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board may deem relevant 

our share repurchases have also been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our board of directors we announced in february 2015 that the board of directors authorized up to 1 billion in future share repurchases during the second and third quarters of 2015 we entered into accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreements to repurchase an aggregate of 600 million of our common stock we received a total of 12 million shares pursuant to these asr agreements with a final weighted average per share price of 4983 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the company entered into an additional asr agreement in december 2015 to repurchase 150 million of our common stock in early 2016

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2015 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address and anticipate the current expanding and evolving needs of our customers accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive drawing on our resources and experience we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry the customers and communities we serve and the environment 

we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry to extract more value from the materials we manage and to innovate and optimize our business we plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from operational improvements and focused differentiation in our industry driven by capitalizing on our extensive wellplaced network of assets while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as our recycling operations 

in pursuit of these longterm goals we recognize that we must grow the business and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible accordingly we are focusing on the following five key company priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry

index to financial statements the following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2014 results with 2013 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2014 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

 our 2013 results were affected by the following 

 

  

 in 2015 we generated strong earnings and cash flow growth from our solid waste business by continuing a disciplined focus on revenue growth and cost control these results were driven by strong core pricing in each line of business controlling costs of both our operations and corporate functions improving customer experience by differentiating our service offerings to reduce customer churn maintaining discipline around capital spending and implementing a more rational and sustainable framework for recycling operations as an integrated component of solid waste services another priority we successfully pursued in 2015 was the investment of cash proceeds from the divestiture of our wheelabrator business in late 2014 to support our strategic growth plans in 2015 we acquired deffenbaugh disposal inc “deffenbaugh” one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest in addition in january 2016 we completed the acquisition of southern waste systemssun recycling in southern florida these transactions reflect our view that we can create shareholder value by making accretive acquisitions in our solid waste business as we look forward to 2016 our key priorities will remain the same — driving revenue growth from yield maintaining our commitment to provide excellent customer service and improving our productivity while managing our costs we believe that continued execution of these objectives will translate into earnings and cash flow growth leaving us well positioned to continue investing in our business pay dividends and repurchase shares while continuing our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet 

free cash flow 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of 

 

index to financial statements businesses and other assets net of cash divested we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity nevertheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 

 

 when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015 to the comparable period in 2014 the increase of 167 million is primarily related to i lower income tax payments net of excess tax benefits associated with equitybased transactions of 329 million in the current year ii lower interest paid of 77 million in the current year and iii the settlement of forwardstarting swap liabilities of 36 million in 2014 these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in cash earnings due to the sale of our wheelabrator business in 2014 ii multiemployer pension plan settlement payments of approximately 60 million in 2015 and iii higher yearoveryear annual incentive plan payments of approximately 65 million finally we experienced unfavorable changes in our assets and liabilities net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures particularly nontrade related items including payroll and incentive accruals however we did experience continued improvement in both trade accounts receivable and accounts payable 

when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014 to the comparable period in 2013 the decrease of 124 million is primarily related to higher income tax payments net of excess tax benefits associated with equitybased transactions of 242 million in 2014 and a payment of 36 million in 2014 to terminate our forwardstarting swaps these decreases were partially offset by higher cash earnings and favorable working capital changes 

although capital expenditures were higher in 2015 and 2013 as compared to 2014 the company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management fluctuations in our capital expenditures are a result of new business opportunities growth in our existing business and the timing of replacement of aging assets 

the significantly higher proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the years ended december 31 2015 and 2013 is largely driven by the 2014 sales of i our wheelabrator business for 195 billion ii our investment in shanghai environment group which was part of our wheelabrator business for 155 million and iii our puerto rico operations for proceeds of 80 million including 65 million in cash 

acquisitions 

deffenbaugh disposal inc — on march 26 2015 we acquired deffenbaugh one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest for total consideration of 416 million 413 million cash 

 

index to financial statements inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital deffenbaugh’s assets include five collection operations seven transfer stations two recycling facilities one subtitled landfill and one construction and demolition landfill 

greenstar llc — on january 31 2013 we paid 170 million inclusive of certain adjustments to acquire greenstar llc “greenstar” pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement up to an additional 40 million was payable to the sellers of which 20 million was guaranteed and paid in 2015 the remaining 20 million of this consideration was contingent based on changes in certain recyclable commodity indexes and had an estimated fair value at closing of 16 million this contingent consideration was not earned greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities this acquisition provides the company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers 

rci environnement inc — on july 5 2013 we paid c509 million or 481 million to acquire substantially all of the assets of rci environnement inc “rci” the largest waste management company in quebec and certain related entities total consideration inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital was c515 million or 487 million rci provides collection transfer recycling and disposal operations throughout the greater montreal area the acquired rci operations complement and expand the company’s existing assets and operations in quebec 

divestitures 

wheelabrator business — on december 19 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business to an affiliate of energy capital partners and received cash proceeds of 195 billion net of cash divested subject to certain postclosing adjustments we recognized a gain of 519 million on this sale which is included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 net adjustments to this gain were immaterial on a pretax basis in conjunction with the sale the company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain wheelabrator facilities these agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments with certain market price resets through 2021 

other — in addition to the divestiture of our wheelabrator business we also divested our puerto rico operations as well as certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in 2014 

in total these divested businesses and assets provided 018 and 016 of earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

subsequent event 

on january 8 2016 waste management inc of florida a whollyowned subsidiary of wm acquired certain operations and business assets of southern waste systemssun recycling in southern florida the acquired business assets include residential commercial and industrial solid waste collection processingrecycling and transfer operations equipment vehicles real estate and customer agreements total consideration inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital paid at closing was 516 million and is subject to standard postclosing adjustments the acquisition was funded primarily with borrowings under our longterm us revolving credit facility “225 billion revolving credit facility” 

basis of presentation of consolidated financial information 

deferred income taxes — in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended authoritative guidance associated with deferred income taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amended guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in 

 

index to financial statements the statement of financial position this eliminates the guidance to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the statement of financial position the amendments to the authoritative guidance associated with deferred income taxes were effective for the company on january 1 2016 however early adoption was permitted the company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2015 was applied retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid 

 

index to financial statements and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

 for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 21 landfill sites with expansions included at december 31 2015 three landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace one landfill required approval by our chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining two landfills required approval because the permit application process did not meet the one or fiveyear requirements 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation 

 

index to financial statements of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

environmental remediation liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

  

  

  

index to financial statements asset impairments 

our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the and “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” line item in our consolidated statement of operations estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as described below 

landfills — the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions — expansion airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion andor development of such landfills these charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our eastern canada area which are no longer accepting waste we had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable however in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis which was influenced in part by our acquisition of rci we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations as a result of management’s decision we determined that the carrying values of landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets as such we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets 

goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess our goodwill for impairment using level 3 inputs 

 

index to financial statements we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we will not perform a quantitative assessment 

if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit the first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units 

during our annual 2013 impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of our wheelabrator business had declined and the associated goodwill was impaired as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 483 million which had no related tax benefit we estimated the implied fair value of our wheelabrator reporting unit goodwill using a combination of income and market approaches because the annual impairment test indicated that wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value we performed the “step two” analysis in the “step two” analysis the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated including tangible assets power contracts customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment the factors contributing to the 483 million goodwill impairment charge principally related to the continued challenging business environment in areas of the country in which wheelabrator operated characterized by lower available disposal volumes which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue as well as the amount of electricity wheelabrator was able to generate lower electricity pricing due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as wheelabrator’s facilities aged these factors caused us to lower prior assumptions for electricity and disposal revenue and increase assumed operating costs additionally the discount factor previously utilized in the income approach in 2013 increased mainly due to increases in interest rates in 2013 we also incurred 10 million of charges to impair goodwill associated with our puerto rico operations in 2014 we recognized 10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — goodwill impairments and income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods 

 

index to financial statements indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 

when performing the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired if we believe an impairment has occurred we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value 

fair value is typically estimated using an income approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business 

fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes should interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable

operating revenues 

our operating revenues set forth below have generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer recycling and resource recovery and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or mrf and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel our divested wheelabrator business provided wastetoenergy services and managed wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business including strategic business solutions “wmsbs” energy and environmental services recycling brokerage services landfill gastoenergy services and expanded service offerings and solutions in addition we offer portable selfstorage and long distance moving services through a joint venture fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ® and street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties these operations are presented as “other” in the table below the following table summarizes revenues during each period in millions 

 

 the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

  

index to financial statements the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

  

   

  

  

  

index to financial statements our revenues decreased 1035 million or 74 for the year ended december 31 2015 our revenue decline was driven by i divestitures in 2014 principally our wheelabrator business in december 2014 our puerto rico operations in the second quarter of 2014 and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in the third quarter of 2014 ii lower volumes iii lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to declining fuel costs iv lower recyclable commodity prices and v foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our canadian operations partially offsetting these revenue declines were i revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations and ii revenue from acquired operations primarily the deffenbaugh acquisition in march 2015 

our revenues increased 13 million or 01 for the year ended december 31 2014 driven by i revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations ii revenue from acquired operations particularly the rci operations acquired in july 2013 and iii fluctuations in electricity prices at wheelabrator’s merchant wastetoenergy facilities that favorably affected revenues offsetting these revenue increases were i revenue declines due to lower volumes ii divestitures in 2014 primarily our puerto rico operations our wheelabrator business and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area iii foreign currency translation and iv revenue declines resulting from lower recyclable commodity prices 

the following provides further details associated with our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer and landfill operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to the types of services provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 203 million or 18 and 262 million or 23 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

our yearoveryear yield growth was driven largely by our continued focus on our pricing strategy with lower rollbacks and improved new business pricing we experienced growth in all three of our principal collection lines of business in both 2015 and 2014 the details are as follows dollars in millions 

 

 other drivers affecting both 2015 and 2014 average yield include 

 

  

index to financial statements   

  

 recycling commodities — the continuing declines in recycling commodities prices resulted in revenue declines of 138 million and 53 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively compared with the prior year 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program decreased 171 million and 2 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively these revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based we experienced a dramatic fuel price decline of approximately 30 in 2015 versus the 24 fuel price decline in 2014 which caused a much more significant decline in our fuel surcharge revenues in the current year the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to passthrough fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations 

volume — declines in our volumes caused our revenue to decrease 215 million or 16 and 188 million or 14 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively as compared with the prior year 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include auto liability workers’ compensation general liability and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include telecommunications equipment and facility rent property taxes utilities and supplies 

our operating expenses decreased 771 million or 86 when comparing 2015 with 2014 and decreased 110 million or 12 when comparing 2014 with 2013 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 635 in 2015 643 in 2014 and 652 in 2013 

 

index to financial statements the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions with significant changes in our operating expenses discussed below 

 

 divestitures — during 2014 we divested our wheelabrator business our puerto rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area the following table lists the operating expense categories in which these divestitures have had a material impact in millions 

 

 in addition to the impact of divestitures noted above other significant items by category of expense include 

labor and related benefits — the following significant items affected the comparability of expenses for the periods presented 

 

  

  

  

  

 transfer and disposal costs — the increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2015 compared to the prior year was primarily due to incurring third party costs for services previously provided on an intercompany basis prior to the divestiture of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 these cost increases were offset in part by 

 

index to financial statements the reduction in costs due to the divestitures as discussed above the decrease in costs in 2014 were driven in part by lower volumes in the collection and recycling lines of business 

maintenance and repairs — the decrease in maintenance and repairs in 2015 was largely driven by the divestiture of wheelabrator which was partially offset by the increased costs related to the deffenbaugh acquisition 

subcontractor costs — the following significant items affected the comparability of expenses for the periods presented 

 

  

  

  

 cost of goods sold — the reduction in costs is primarily driven by lower recycling rebates due to i lower commodity prices ii increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers iii better alignment of rebate structures with commodity prices for new recycling contracts and iv ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around inbound quality control these cost reductions were offset in part by increased costs in our remediation business and increased costs in 2014 related to our portable selfstorage service 

fuel — the decrease in fuel expense in 2015 and 2014 when compared to the prior periods was driven by i lower fuel prices ii lower fuel purchases due to reduced collection volumes iii lower costs resulting from the conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and iv yearoveryear increases in natural gas fuel excise credits 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include i increased disposal fees and taxes due to higher landfill volumes ii decreased costs due to divestitures and iii a disposal surcharge in 2013 

landfill operating costs — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include i unfavorable adjustments in 2014 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in us treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets and ii higher leachate costs for all comparable periods 

risk management — the decrease in costs in 2014 was primarily due to lower auto and general liability claims and to a lesser extent decreased workers’ compensation claims 

selling general and administrative 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefit costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses decreased 138 million or 93 when comparing 2015 with 2014 and increased 13 million or 09 when comparing 2014 with 2013 our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 104 in 2015 106 in 2014 and 105 in 2013 

 

index to financial statements the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 our 2014 divestitures primarily the sale of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 favorably affected all cost categories when comparing expenses in 2015 to 2014 in addition to the impact of divestitures other significant items by category of expense include 

labor and related benefits — factors affecting the yearoveryear changes in our labor and related benefits costs include 

 

  

  

 other — changes in our other expenses are a result of higher litigation settlement costs in 2014 and our continued focus on controlling costs 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 40 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life using either a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

  

index to financial statements the decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2015 is primarily due to the december 2014 sale of our wheelabrator business as discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2015 is primarily due to increased volumes a portion of which relates to the acquisition of deffenbaugh this increase was partially offset by favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2014 is primarily attributable to favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates and fixed asset depreciation that was suspended when our wheelabrator business was classified as heldforsale in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequently sold in december 2014 

restructuring 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized 15 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 10 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs including costs associated with the loss of a municipal contract in our eastern canada area and our acquisition of deffenbaugh the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

in august 2014 we announced a consolidation and realignment of several corporate functions to better support achievement of the company’s strategic goals including cost reduction voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations approximately 650 employees separated from our corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized a total of 82 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized a total of 18 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs including costs associated with our acquisitions of greenstar and rci and our prior restructurings the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

goodwill impairments 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized 10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 509 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to i 483 million associated with our wheelabrator business ii 10 million associated with our puerto rico operations and iii 9 million associated with a majorityowned waste diversion technology company see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions — asset impairments and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments

 interest expense net 

our interest expense net was 385 million in 2015 466 million in 2014 and 477 million in 2013 during 2015 the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the refinancing of a significant portion of our highcoupon senior notes as a result of the combination of a makewhole redemption of certain senior notes cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of 18 billion of new senior notes we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1 during 2014 the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to i the impacts that lower market interest rates had on certain of our taxexempt debt ii issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and iii reduced costs associated with our letter of credit facilities due to improvements in the company’s overall credit rating these decreases were partially offset by increases in expense associated with our terminated interest rate swaps due to the maturity of the underlying senior notes 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during 2015 we refinanced a significant portion of our highcoupon senior notes as a result of the combination of a makewhole redemption of certain senior notes cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of 18 billion of new senior notes we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1 and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations by three years additional details related to each component of the refinancing follow 

makewhole redemption — in january 2015 we repaid 947 million of wm senior notes which comprised all of the outstanding senior notes maturing in 2015 2017 and 2019 the repayment of these debt balances was achieved by exercising the optional redemption provisions of the notes which required that we pay the outstanding principal plus a makewhole premium the “loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 includes the 122 million of charges related to these redemptions 

tender offers — during 2015 wm and wm holdings made cash tender offers to purchase any and all of certain outstanding senior notes the series of notes targeted in the tenders and the amounts tendered of each series are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

 the “loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 includes 430 million of charges related to these tender offers 

 

index to financial statements equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

we recognized “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of 38 million 53 million and 34 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively these losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility as well as i noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and ii unconsolidated trusts for final capping closure postclosure or environmental obligations the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in lowincome housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in provision for income taxes refer to notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments in 2014 we recognized an additional 11 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value 

other net 

we recognized other net expense of 7 million 29 million and 74 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the expenses for 2015 2014 and 2013 were impacted by impairment charges of 5 million 22 million and 71 million respectively related to otherthantemporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies accounted for under the cost method we wrote down our investments to their fair value which was primarily determined using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections and to a lesser extent thirdparty investors’ recent transactions in these securities partially offsetting the 2013 charges was a 4 million gain on the sale of a similar investment the remaining expenses recognized during the reported periods are primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded provisions for income taxes of 308 million in 2015 413 million in 2014 and 364 million in 2013 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 291 236 and 738 for the years ended 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes ii federal tax credits iii adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes iv the realization of state net operating losses and credits v tax audit settlements and vi the tax implications of divestitures and impairments the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

index to financial statements   

  

  

 we expect our 2016 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 350 based on projected income before income taxes federal tax credits and other permanent items which is similar to prior year expectations 

the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 was signed into law on december 18 2015 and included an extension for five years of the bonus depreciation allowance as a result 50 of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before january 1 2016 were depreciated immediately the acceleration of deductions on 2015 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2015 although it will reduce our cash taxes by approximately 65 million this reduction will be offset by increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken 

noncontrolling interests 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was 1 million in 2015 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 40 million in 2014 and 32 million in 2013 the income for 2014 and 2013 was principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies “llcs” that owned three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator business in december 2014 we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the llcs from the third parties in anticipation of our sale of the wheelabrator business the llcs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment of our wheelabrator business refer to notes 19 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the sale of our wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities respectively 

the income for 2013 includes a net loss of 10 million attributable to noncontrolling interest holders associated with the 20 million impairment charge related to a majorityowned waste diversion technology company discussed above in income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items  

 

index to financial statements landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2015 and 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2014 at december 31 2015 and 2014 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2015 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 46 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 21 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2015 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

  

   

index to financial statements the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 in millions 

 

  

   the tons received at our landfills in 2015 and 2014 are shown below tons in thousands 

 

  

   

index to financial statements when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2015 our closed sites management group managed 210 closed landfills 

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2015 and 2014 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2015 in millions 

 

 as of december 31 2015 we estimate that we will spend approximately 400 million in 2016 and approximately 900 million in 2017 and 2018 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

 

index to financial statements the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2015 and 2014 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2015 in millions 

 

 landfill costs and expenses — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 the comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted average period until settlement of the underlying obligations 

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

 amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset 

 

index to financial statements retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis 

 

 different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 249 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v final capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and vii capital expenditures acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and we have also returned value to our shareholders through share repurchases 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2015 and 2014 in millions 

 

  

index to financial statements cash and cash equivalents — cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2014 included a portion of the 195 billion of proceeds from the divestiture of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 in 2015 we have primarily allocated available cash to the acquisition of deffenbaugh repurchasing shares and paying premiums on the early extinguishment of debt discussion of these activities is included in notes 19 15 and 7 respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

restricted trust and escrow accounts — the decrease in final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation funds from december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 is primarily due to the closure of certain trust and escrow accounts which were converted to other forms of financial assurance other restricted trust and escrow accounts at december 31 2014 included the funding of a legal settlement which was paid in full in the second quarter of 2015 

debt — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2015 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 were primarily attributable to i net debt repayments of 427 million and ii the impacts of other noncash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps foreign currency translation and discounts 

as of december 31 2015 we had 732 million of debt maturing within the next 12 months including i 500 million of 26 senior notes that mature in september 2016 ii 146 million of taxexempt bonds and iii 20 million of borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility in addition 316 million of taxexempt bonds have term interest rate periods subject to repricing within the next 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities we have classified the 20 million of borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility as longterm because we intend and have the ability to refinance or maintain these borrowings on a longterm basis based on our intent and ability to refinance other portions of our current obligations on a longterm basis as of december 31 2015 including through use of forecasted available capacity under our 225 billion revolving credit facility we have classified an additional 775 million of debt as longterm the remaining 253 million is classified as current obligations 

during 2015 we refinanced a significant portion of our highcoupon senior notes in order to reduce the weighted average interest rate and extend the weighted average duration of our debt balances we achieved this through a combination of a makewhole redemption of certain senior notes cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of 18 billion of new senior notes consisting of 

 

  

  

 the net proceeds from these debt issuances were 178 billion the company used the proceeds from the 2025 notes for general corporate purposes the proceeds from the 2035 notes and the 2045 notes were used to pay the purchase price and accrued interest for the notes redeemed through the tender offers discussed above and for general corporate purposes see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the debt transactions

 we paid 600 million for share repurchases during both 2015 and 2014 and 239 million for share repurchases during 2013 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

index to financial statements we announced in december 2015 that the board of directors refreshed its prior authorization of up to 1 billion in future share repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations 

 

 we paid an aggregate of 695 million in cash dividends during 2015 compared with 693 million in 2014 and 683 million in 2013 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 0365 in 2013 to 0375 in 2014 and to 0385 in 2015 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs 

in december 2015 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0385 to 041 per share for dividends declared in 2016 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board may deem relevant 

 

  

  

 for the year ended december 31 2015 noncash financing activities included 262 million of taxexempt bond refundings and reissuances for the year ended december 31 2013 noncash financing activities included proceeds from taxexempt borrowings net of principal payments made directly from trust funds of 99 million during 2014 we did not have any significant noncash financing activities

 summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

  

      

index to financial statements   liquidity impacts of income tax items 

cash taxes — our tax payments in 2015 net of excess tax benefits associated with equitybased transactions were 329 million lower than 2014 primarily due to i lower pretax earnings due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt and ii the tax implications and related impacts of divestitures and impairments 

bonus depreciation — the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 was signed into law on december 18 2015 and included an extension for five years of the bonus depreciation allowance as a result 50 of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before january 1 2016 were depreciated immediately the acceleration of deductions on 2015 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2015 although it will reduce our cash taxes by approximately 65 million this reduction will be offset by increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken overall the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs resulted in increased cash taxes of approximately 25 million in 2015 

uncertain tax positions — we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets because the company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we might make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity as of december 31 2015 we anticipate that approximately 36 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest and 5 million of related tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months the anticipated reversals primarily relate to the deductibility and exclusion from gross income of certain federal tax items and other miscellaneous state tax items each of which is individually insignificant the recognition of the unrecognized tax benefits is expected to result from the filing of our tax returns audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2015 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting standard pending adoption 

in may 2014 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition the amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 

 

index to financial statements customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts the amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the company on january 1 2018 the amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial application we are in the process of assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of diesel fuel have affected our income from operations margins in recent years we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2015 approximately 30 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount as of december 31 2015 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs which are discussed in the financial assurance and insurance obligations section of item 1 

as of december 31 2015 we had 90 billion of longterm debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives discounts and premiums approximately 911 million of our debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months our variablerate debt obligations are i 491 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process ii 316 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within 12 months which is prior to their scheduled maturities iii 84 million of outstanding borrowings under our canadian term loan and iv 20 million of borrowings outstanding under 225 billion revolving credit facility we currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2016 interest expense by approximately 8 million as of december 31 2014 the effective interest rates of approximately 14 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within 12 months 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our “fixedrate” tax exempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments if any can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive debt instruments this analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular 

 

index to financial statements hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately 600 million at december 31 2015 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate during the three years ended december 31 2015 we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives divested in conjunction with the sale of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 alternatively we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues also increase or decrease 

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as a cost center in india and investments in hong kong where significant we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income including operating revenue and operating costs however the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations during 2015 we did see a reduction in stockholders’ equity of 159 million due to the fluctuations in the canadian dollar within accumulated other comprehensive income loss we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk using currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company the foreign currency exposure associated with these investments has not been material refer to notes 8 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives and translation

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer recycling and resource recovery and disposal services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states in december 2014 we completed the sale of our subsidiary wheelabrator technologies inc our wheelabrator business provided wastetoenergy services and managed wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants during 2014 our largest customer represented less than 1 of annual revenues we employed approximately 39800 people as of december 31 2014 

we own or operate 252 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in our industry in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills is typically farther we manage 298 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic metal and electronics we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada as well as other services that supplement our traditional solid waste business 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are 

 

becoming more complex and our aim is to address and anticipate the current expanding and evolving needs of our customers accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive drawing on our resources and experience we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry the customers and communities we serve and the environment 

we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry to extract more value from the materials we manage and to innovate and optimize our business we plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from a “best cost” structure achieved through operational improvements and differentiation in our industry driven by capitalizing on our extensive wellplaced network of assets while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as recycling operations 

in pursuit of these longterm goals we recognize that we must grow the business and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible accordingly we are focusing on the following five key company priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and common stock repurchases in february 2015 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0375 to 0385 per share for dividends declared in 2015 which is a 27 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2014 this will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the 12 th consecutive year and is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors 

operations 

general 

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our local solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 areas see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments in december 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants we intend to reinvest the proceeds from the sale of our wheelabrator business to create longterm stockholder value our priority is to pursue acquisitions in our solid waste business and we will also evaluate repurchasing our common stock and making other investments in support of our strategic growth plans while continuing our focus on a strong balance sheet refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our 

 

divestiture we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other”

 the services we currently provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below prior to the sale of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 we provided wastetoenergy services and managed wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years presented 

 

 collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

  

 landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2014 we owned or operated 247 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and as a result thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer at december 31 2014 we owned or operated 298 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of 

 

the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

wheelabrator on december 19 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business to an affiliate of energy capital partners and received cash proceeds of 195 billion net of cash divested subject to certain postclosing adjustments we recognized a gain of 519 million on this sale which is included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” in the consolidated statement of operations in conjunction with the sale the company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain wheelabrator facilities these agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments with certain market price resets for up to seven years 

wheelabrator provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants wheelabrator owns or operates 16 wastetoenergy facilities and four independent power production plants prior to the sale our wheelabrator business constituted a reportable segment as discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements we concluded that the sale of our wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under current authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the longterm waste supply agreements referred to above and in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage in 2001 we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing we operate 126 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale 

plastics materials recycling — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

commodities recycling — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

 

recycling brokerage services — we also provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements we also provide electronics recycling we recycle discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials in recent years we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “takeback” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods market conditions and transportation costs but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers which are recorded as “operating expenses” within our consolidated statements of operations in recent years we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell 

other other services we provide include the following 

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts program which is managed by our strategic business solutions organization works with customers whose locations span the united states our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs 

our energy and environmental services organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i construction and remediation services ii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks iii inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services this service is managed through our energy and environmental services organization but reflected principally in our collection business and iv specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection business our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the epa endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2014 we had 134 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 123 of our solid waste landfills and four thirdparty landfills at 107 of these landfills the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 16 landfills the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at 

 

10 landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers at one landfill the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel 

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology we also offer portable selfstorage services through a joint venture fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ®  and street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

seasonal trends 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends through 2014 the operating results of our first quarter also often reflected higher repair and maintenance expenses because prior to the sale of our wheelabrator business we relied on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins 

 

employees 

at december 31 2014 we had approximately 39800 fulltime employees of which approximately 7000 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 8500 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity 

surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by i a diverse group of thirdparty surety and insurance companies ii an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or iii whollyowned insurance subsidiary national guaranty insurance company of vermont the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds andor insurance policies on our behalf letters of credit generally are supported by our 225 billion revolving credit facility and other credit facilities established for that purpose 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability business interruption and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2014 our commercial general liability insurance policy carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 25 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2014 our auto liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 5 million subject to additional deductibles of 48 million in the 5 million to 10 million layer we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2014 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage often referred to as “side b” the side a policy covers directors and officers directly for loss including defense costs when corporate indemnification is unavailable side aonly coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the company as the company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers 

regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us environmental protection agency “epa” environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of 

 

violations in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue 

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in united states federal regulations affecting our business 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 state provincial and local regulations 

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills the number of cities with food waste recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow while the logistics and economics of food waste recycling remain challenging 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in canada and the us epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the 

 

applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

foreign import regulation 

enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry particularly for single stream mrfs single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs despite these increased costs we believe we are well positioned among our potential competitors to respond to and comply with such regulations we are revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle properly 

hydraulic fracturing regulation 

our energy services line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations recently there has been increased attention from the public some states and the epa on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas as well as protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services on the other hand we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services 

emissions from natural gas fueling and infrastructure 

we currently operate the largest compressed natural gas “cng” fleet in the waste industry and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to cng we have constructed and operate 72 natural gas fueling stations 25 of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties in 28 states and three canadian provinces concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles we have partnered with the environmental organization environmental defense fund as well as other heavyduty equipment users and experts on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers we anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavyduty fleet may ultimately result in regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry additional regulation of or restrictions on cng fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our current plan to continue transitioning to cng vehicles 

 

federal state and local climate change initiatives 

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity 

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events 




 item 1a risk factors 

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements containing 

 

  

  

  

 you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2015 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that 

 

specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview for more information on our business strategy 

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

compliance with existing or future regulations andor enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility or epr are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in canada and the us epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry particularly for single stream mrfs single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of nonrecyclables which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs if operation green fence or other similar initiatives or new regulations increase our operating costs in the future and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities particularly demand from chinese paper mills can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively such as we experienced in 2014 2013 and 2012 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the decline in market prices in 2014 2013 and 2012 for commodities resulted in yearoveryear decreases in revenue of 53 million 79 million and 428 million respectively additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated 

fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business significant variations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations additionally we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our energy services business demand for these services may decrease if drilling activity slows due to changes in oil and gas prices such as the pronounced recent price decreases any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future

 

changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our energy services business 

energy services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control in addition to changes in oil and gas prices changes in laws or government regulations regarding ghg emissions from oil and gas operations andor hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers recently there has been increased attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies there is also heightened regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas as well as protective disposal of drilling residuals increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or wastetoenergy facility some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal our landfills currently provide and together with our divested wastetoenergy facilities have historically provided our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results may decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may 

 

negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

 we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

 

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years due in part to reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2014 we had 501 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and 638 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject 

 

or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns average diesel fuel prices decreased in both 2014 and 2013 but increased in 2012 we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally if fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally we recently settled litigation that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices and we may face similar claims in the future see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins 

we are expanding our compressed natural gas “cng” truck fleet which makes us increasingly dependent on the availability of cng and cng fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to cng prices 

we currently operate the largest cng fleet in the waste industry and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to cng however cng is not yet broadly available in north america as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties until the public and third parties in north america broadly adopt cng which may not be on the timetable we anticipate it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in cng fueling infrastructure in order to power our cng fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on cng fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of cng could substantially increase our operating expenses and a reduction in the existing cost differential between cng and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in cng vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for cng may not effectively be recovered by this program 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements the risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer plans in that i assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other participating employers ii if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and iii if we choose to stop participating in any of our multiemployer plans we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the plan 

in connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans further business events such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract the decertification of a union or relocation reduction or discontinuance of certain operations which result in the decline of company contributions to a multiemployer pension plan could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal in the event of a withdrawal we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan the ongoing solvency of participating employers the investment returns obtained on plan assets and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation depending on such factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of 

 

operations for a particular reporting period we reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet 

we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 4 million in 2014 5 million in 2013 and 10 million in 2012 we are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for certain withdrawals which could be higher than the charges we have recognized 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures mass instability or waste slides severe weather and natural disasters which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials and odors injury or death of employees and others or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken additionally we have built and are operating cng fueling stations to serve our growing fleet of cng trucks some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion all of these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages personal injury loss of life business interruption and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training and compliance programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to 

 

obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or fail to maintain our desired credit profile 

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile as well as a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by third party rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 14 billion of debt as of december 31 2014 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our canadian term loan if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow 

we may use our 225 billion revolving credit facility and our c150 million canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in july 2018 and november 2017 respectively as of december 31 2014 we had no outstanding borrowings and 785 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the 225 billion revolving credit facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1465 million and we had no borrowings under the canadian revolving credit facility in the event of a default under our credit facilities we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however if certain changes to these regulations were enacted such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs 

the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events and “onetime” special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends the operating results of our first quarter often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

our share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our board of directors in february 2014 the board of directors authorized up to 600 million in future share repurchases during the third quarter of 2014 we entered into accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 600 million of our common stock at the beginning of the asr repurchase periods we delivered the 600 million in cash and received 96 million shares which represented 70 of the shares expected to be repurchased based on thencurrent market prices these agreements were completed in february 2015 and we received approximately 28 million additional shares the final weighted average per share purchase price for the completed asr agreements was 4858 

we announced in february 2015 that the board of directors has authorized up to 1 billion in future share repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board in making dividend declarations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2014 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource increasingly customers want more of their waste materials recovered while waste streams are becoming more complex and our aim is to address and anticipate the current expanding and evolving needs of our customers accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  

we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future as the waste industry leader we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive drawing on our resources and experience we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry the customers and communities we serve and the environment 

we remain dedicated to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry to extract more value from the materials we manage and to innovate and optimize our business we plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from a “best cost” structure achieved through operational improvements and differentiation in our industry driven by capitalizing on our extensive wellplaced network of assets while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies such as recycling operations 

in pursuit of these longterm goals we recognize that we must grow the business and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible accordingly we are focusing on the following five key company priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry 

notable items of our 2014 financial results include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2014 results with 2013 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2014 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

 the following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2013 results with 2012 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2013 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

 our 2012 results were affected by the following 

 

  

 the recognition of a pretax charge of 10 million related to the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and a pretax charge of 6 million resulting from a labor union dispute these items had a negative impact of 002 on our diluted earnings per share and 

 

 we began the year with a focus on growing earnings and free cash flow increasing yield and exercising discipline around capital spending and costs and the company’s execution on these goals translated into strong overall operating results in 2014 additionally we increased the amount we returned to stockholders in 2014 compared to 2013 by increasing our dividend and share repurchases our fourth quarter results capitalized on the momentum we built throughout the year delivering growth in income from operations and income from operations margin in our solid waste business that we expect to continue into 2015 during the fourth quarter we also completed our previously announced divestiture of our wheelabrator business for cash proceeds of 195 billion net of cash divested subject to certain postclosing adjustments we intend to use these proceeds in support of our strategic growth plans to drive longterm stockholder value with our priority being on making accretive acquisitions in our solid waste business we also expect our focus on our five key priorities set forth above — customers traditional waste business growth yield management and costs – to translate into continued strong free cash flow to pay our dividends repurchase shares and make other growth investments while continuing our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet 

free cash flow 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity nevertheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 

 

 when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014 to the comparable period in 2013 the decrease of 124 million is primarily related to higher income tax payments of 247 million in the current year and a payment of 36 million made in the first quarter of 2014 to terminate our forward starting swaps these decreases were partially offset by higher cash earnings and favorable working capital changes 

when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013 to the comparable period in 2012 the increase of 160 million was primarily related to the impact of higher cash earnings favorable impacts of working capital changes and the payment of 59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in september 2012 the increase was partially offset by an increase in tax payments of 145 million and the favorable cash receipt of 72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in april 2012 

the decrease in capital expenditures when comparing the year ended december 31 2014 to the comparable period in 2013 and comparing the year ended december 31 2013 to the comparable period in 2012 can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management 

the increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets net of cash divested for the year ended december 31 2014 from the comparable period in 2013 is largely driven by i the sale of our wheelabrator business in the fourth quarter of 2014 for 195 billion ii the sale of our investment in shanghai environment group “seg” which was part of our wheelabrator business in the first quarter of 2014 for 155 million iii the sale of our puerto rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter of 2014 for proceeds of 80 million including 65 million in cash iv the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in the third quarter of 2014 for 39 million and v the sale of a vacant facility in the second quarter of 2014 for 19 million 

pending acquisition 

on september 17 2014 the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of deffenbaugh disposal inc one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest closing of the acquisition is expected to occur in early 2015 subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 

acquisitions 

greenstar llc — on january 31 2013 we paid 170 million inclusive of certain adjustments to acquire greenstar llc “greenstar” pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement up to an additional 40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018 of which 20 million is guaranteed the remaining 20 million of this consideration is contingent based on changes in certain recyclable commodity indexes and 

 

had an estimated fair value at closing of 16 million greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities this acquisition provides the company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers 

rci environnement inc — on july 5 2013 we paid c509 million or 481 million to acquire substantially all of the assets of rci environnement inc “rci” the largest waste management company in quebec and certain related entities total consideration inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital was c515 million or 487 million rci provides collection transfer recycling and disposal operations throughout the greater montreal area the acquired rci operations complement and expand the company’s existing assets and operations in quebec 

divestitures 

divestiture of wheelabrator business 

on december 19 2014 we sold our wheelabrator business to an affiliate of energy capital partners and received cash proceeds of 195 billion net of cash divested subject to certain postclosing adjustments we recognized a gain of 519 million on this sale which is included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” in the consolidated statement of operations in conjunction with the sale the company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain wheelabrator facilities these agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments with certain market price resets for up to seven years 

wheelabrator provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants wheelabrator owns or operates 16 wastetoenergy facilities and four independent power production plants prior to the sale our wheelabrator business constituted a reportable segment for the company as discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements we concluded that the sale of our wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under current authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the longterm waste supply agreements referred to above and in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

other divestitures 

in the second quarter of 2014 we sold our puerto rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets which were included in tier 3 and tier 1 respectively of our solid waste business we received proceeds from the sale of 80 million consisting of 65 million of cash and 15 million of preferred stock and recognized a loss on the sale of 25 million 

in the third quarter of 2014 we sold certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area which were included in tier 3 we received cash proceeds from the sale of 39 million and recognized a gain of 18 million 

the gain or loss on these divestitures is included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” in the consolidated statement of operations the remaining proceeds from divestitures in 2014 were comprised substantially of cash additional information on our reportable segments can be found in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

basis of presentation of consolidated financial information 

comprehensive income — in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income which requires companies to provide 

 

information about the amounts that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component additionally companies are required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income the amendment to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income was effective for the company on january 1 2013 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we have presented the information required by this amendment in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing — in july 2012 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing the amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is not required to take further action the amendments were effective for indefinitelived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 however early adoption was permitted the company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements additional information on impairment testing can be found in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final 

 

capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

  

 for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 23 landfill sites with expansions included at december 31 2014 five landfills required the 

 

chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace two of these landfills required approval by our chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining three landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one or fiveyear requirements 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

environmental remediation liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation 

 

considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

  

  

 asset impairments 

our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” line item in our consolidated statement of operations estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as described below 

landfills — the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions — expansion airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit 

 

at december 31 2014 one of our landfill sites for which we believe receipt of the expansion permit is probable is not currently accepting waste the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for this site was 247 million at december 31 2014 we performed a test of recoverability for this landfill and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying value of this site during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion andor development of such landfills these charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our eastern canada area which are no longer accepting waste we had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable however in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis which was influenced in part by our acquisition of rci we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations as a result of management’s decision we determined that the carrying values of landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets as such we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to landfill asset impairments recognized during the reported periods 

goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess our goodwill for impairment using level 3 inputs 

we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we will not perform a quantitative assessment 

if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit the first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units 

 

during our annual 2013 impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of our wheelabrator business had declined and the associated goodwill was impaired as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 483 million which had no related tax benefit we estimated the implied fair value of our wheelabrator reporting unit goodwill using a combination of income and market approaches because the annual impairment test indicated that wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value we performed the “step two” analysis in the “step two” analysis the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated including tangible assets power contracts customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment the factors contributing to the 483 million goodwill impairment charge principally related to the continued challenging business environment in areas of the country in which wheelabrator operated characterized by lower available disposal volumes which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue as well as the amount of electricity wheelabrator was able to generate lower electricity pricing due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as wheelabrator’s facilities aged these factors caused us to lower prior assumptions for electricity and disposal revenue and increase assumed operating costs additionally the discount factor previously utilized in the income approach in 2013 increased mainly due to increases in interest rates in 2013 we incurred an additional 10 million of charges to impair goodwill associated with our puerto rico operations and 4 million to impair goodwill associated with our recycling business in 2014 we recognized 10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — goodwill impairments and notes 6 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods 

indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 

when performing the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired if we believe an impairment has occurred we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value 

fair value is typically estimated using an income approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business 

fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

 

significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes to the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax such amounts have been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues set forth below have generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer recycling and resource recovery and wastetoenergy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or mrf and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel our recently divested wheelabrator business provided wastetoenergy services and managed wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste or wheelabrator businesses including strategic business solutions “wmsbs” energy and environmental services recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services landfill gastoenergy services and expanded service offerings and solutions we also offer portable selfstorage services through a joint venture fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program portable restroom servicing under the name portolet ® and street and parking lot sweeping services in addition we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties these operations are presented as “other” in the table below the following table summarizes revenues during each period in millions 

 

  

the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our revenues increased 13 million or 01 for the year ended december 31 2014 our revenue fluctuation in the current period has been driven by i revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations ii revenue from acquired operations particularly the rci operations acquired in july 2013 which contributed approximately 77 million to the revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2014 and iii fluctuations in electricity prices at wheelabrator’s merchant wastetoenergy facilities that favorably affected revenues offsetting these revenue increases were i revenue declines due to lower volumes ii divestitures primarily our puerto rico divestiture in the second quarter of 2014 certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in the third quarter of 2014 and our wheelabrator business in december 2014 iii foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our canadian operations and iv revenue declines resulting from lower recyclable commodity prices 

our revenues increased 334 million or 24 for the year ended december 31 2013 our revenue fluctuation in the prior period was driven by i revenue from acquired operations particularly greenstar acquired in january 2013 and rci which increased revenues by 138 million and 80 million respectively ii increased revenue growth from our collection and disposal average yield iii higher revenues provided by 

 

our fuel surcharge program and iv fluctuations in electricity prices at our merchant wastetoenergy facilities offsetting these revenue increases were i revenue declines resulting from lower recyclable commodity prices ii foreign currency translation which negatively affected revenues from our canadian operations and iii revenue declines due to lower volumes 

the following provides further details associated with our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer landfill and wastetoenergy disposal operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 262 million or 23 and 235 million or 21 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

we experienced growth in all three of our principal collection lines of business in both 2014 and 2013 the details are as follows dollars in millions 

 

 our yearoveryear yield growth in both 2014 and 2013 was driven largely by our pricing strategy that combines focused effort on price increases with lower rollbacks conversely our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy with more significant volume declines during 2014 however our pricing strategy and our focus on controlling variable costs have consistently provided margin improvements in our collection line of business although we have seen margin deterioration in our residential line of business throughout 2014 other drivers affecting the current period average yield include 

 

  

  

  

 recycling commodities — decreases in the prices of the recycling commodities we sell resulted in revenue declines of 53 million and 79 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively compared with the same prior year period 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program decreased 2 million and increased 32 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively these revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based we experienced a fuel price decline of approximately 24 in 2014 which caused a slight decrease in our fuel surcharge revenues these revenues increased in 2013 resulting from a revision of the surcharge calculation implemented to better capture price increases intended to be recovered by the surcharge the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to passthrough fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations 

volume — declines in our volume caused our revenue to decrease 188 million or 14 and 133 million or 10 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively as compared with prior year periods driven primarily by declines in our collection business our volume fluctuations are generally attributable to economic conditions pricing changes competition and diversion of waste by customers our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy we are experiencing volume declines due to the loss of low margin customers that we are not willing to keep at current rates additionally we are experiencing losses of certain municipal contracts that are up for bid as a result of both the very competitive environment and our focus on reasonable returns we continue to face challenges to keep existing contracts and to win new contracts finally we experienced revenue declines associated with the loss of certain large accounts in our wmsbs organization 

other drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions and divestitures — revenues increased 124 million and 292 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively due to acquisitions the revenue increase due to acquisitions in both 2014 and 2013 was principally associated with the rci operations acquired in july 2013 to a lesser extent 2013 revenues increased due to the acquisition of greenstar in january of that year which is reported in our “recycling” line of business 

these revenues were offset partially by revenue decreases of 90 million and 6 million due to divestitures for the years ended 2014 and 2013 respectively the revenue decrease in 2014 is primarily due to i our divestiture of our puerto rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter of 2014 ii the divestiture of certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in the third quarter of 2014 and iii the divestiture of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 

 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include auto liability workers’ compensation general liability and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include telecommunications equipment and facility rent property taxes utilities and supplies 

our operating expenses decreased 110 million or 12 when comparing 2014 with 2013 and increased 233 million or 26 when comparing 2013 with 2012 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 643 in 2014 652 in 2013 and 651 in 2012 

divestitures — during 2014 we divested our wheelabrator business in the fourth quarter our puerto rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in the third quarter as mentioned above we estimate that divestitures reduced our annual revenues by 90 million commensurately we estimate our operating expenses decreased by approximately 56 million due to divestitures when compared to the prior year period the decreases in costs were primarily in i labor and related benefits and ii maintenance and repairs 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions with significant changes in our operating expenses discussed below 

 

 labor and related benefits  — the following significant items affected the comparability of expenses for the periods presented 

 

the decrease in labor and related benefits in 2014 as compared with 2013 was due to 

 

  

  

  

 the increase in labor and related benefits in 2013 as compared with 2012 was due to 

 

  

  

  

  

 maintenance and repairs  — the increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by i the greenstar acquisition and ii higher internal shop labor costs due in part to higher incentive compensation and merit increases

subcontractor costs — the increase in 2014 was driven by i remediation services within our energy and environmental services business and ii the rci operations acquired in july 2013 offset in part by the volume decline related to the loss of certain large accounts in our wmsbs organization the decrease in 2013 was driven primarily by the volume decline associated with the loss of certain large accounts in our wmsbs organization these decreases were offset in part by higher costs associated with the acquired rci operations 

cost of goods sold — the decrease in cost of goods sold in 2014 is due to i increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers ii better alignment of rebate structures to commodity prices for new recycling contracts iii ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around inbound quality control and iv lower commodity prices these cost decreases were offset in part by our business in portable selfstorage services and remediation services the increase in cost of goods sold in 2013 is due in large part to higher customer rebates resulting from higher volumes in our recycling commodity business driven primarily by the acquired greenstar operations 

fuel — the decrease in fuel expense in both 2014 and 2013 when compared to the prior year periods was driven by i lower fuel purchases due to reduced collection volumes ii lower costs resulting from the conversion of our fleet to cng vehicles iii lower fuel prices and iv retroactive cng fuel excise credits 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes— the increase in costs in both 2014 and 2013 can be attributable to i higher disposal fees and taxes due to higher landfill volumes and ii higher municipal franchise fees relating to the collection line of business a disposal surcharge at one of our wastetoenergy facilities in 2013 affected the comparability in both periods 

landfill operating costs — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include i unfavorable adjustments in 2014 and 2012 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in us treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery rates and ii higher leachate costs for all comparable periods 

 

risk management — the decrease in costs in 2014 was primarily due to lower auto and general liability claims and to a lesser extent decreased workers’ compensation claims and lower truck insurance expenses the increase in costs in 2013 was driven principally by higher workers’ compensation claims 

other — the decrease in 2014 is primarily due to the gain on the sale of a vacant facility and lower rental costs the increased costs in 2013 when compared to 2012 were due in part to i higher telecommunications costs driven by our initiative to equip our fleet with onboard computers ii higher utilities iii higher property taxes and iv lower gains on the sale of assets these increases were offset in part by favorable adjustments to contingent consideration associated with acquisitions

selling general and administrative 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefit costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses increased by 13 million or 09 and decreased by 4 million or 03 when comparing 2014 with 2013 and 2013 with 2012 respectively our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 106 in 2014 105 in 2013 and 108 in 2012 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 labor and related benefits — factors affecting the yearoveryear changes in our labor and related benefits costs include 

 

  

  

  

 professional fees — our professional fees continued to decline during 2014 as a result of our concerted effort to reduce consulting fees our 2013 consulting fees were lower as we incurred significant fees during 2012 resulting from companywide initiatives the lower consulting fees were partially offset by higher legal fees in 2014 as compared to 2013 

 

provision for bad debts — our provision for bad debts decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily as a result of i the collection of certain fully reserved receivables related to our puerto rico operations and ii resolution of billing delay issues experienced during 2012 in our wmsbs organization 

other — in 2014 increased costs resulting principally from litigation settlements were partially offset by a decline in controllable costs associated with advertising and travel and entertainment costs in 2013 controllable costs associated with i building and equipment ii advertising iii computer and telecommunication iv travel and entertainment and v seminars and education declined primarily as a result of our july 2012 restructuring and focus on costcontrol initiatives 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life using either a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2014 is primarily attributable to favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates and fixed asset depreciation that was suspended when our wheelabrator business was classified as heldforsale in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequently sold in december 2014 the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2013 that continued in 2014 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of rci 

restructuring 

in august 2014 we announced a consolidation and realignment of several corporate functions to better support achievement of the company’s strategic goals including cost reduction voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations approximately 650 employees have separated from our corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring but we do not anticipate that all of these positions will be permanently eliminated 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized a total of 82 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized we do not expect to incur any material charges associated with our 2014 restructuring in future periods 

 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized a total of 18 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs including costs associated with our acquisitions of greenstar and rci and our 2012 restructurings the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

in july 2012 we announced a reorganization of operations designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure while not disrupting our frontline operations principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic groups each of which previously constituted a reportable segment and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic areas through which we evaluate and oversee our solid waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17 this reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the company including positions at both the management and support level voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized a total of 67 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 56 million were primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with these reorganizations the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

goodwill impairments 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized 10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 509 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to i 483 million associated with our wheelabrator business ii 10 million associated with our puerto rico operations and iii 9 million associated with a majorityowned waste diversion technology company during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 4 million related to certain of our nonsolid waste operations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical estimates and assumptions — asset impairments and notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments 

income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized net income of 170 million primarily related to the following 

 

  

  

  

 during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized net charges of 464 million primarily related to the following 

 

  

  

  

 during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized impairment charges of 79 million attributable to i 45 million of charges related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities ii 20 million of charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies and iii other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values all of which are individually immaterial 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions — asset impairments for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments 

in addition to the impairments discussed above we are continuing to evaluate opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives or are underperforming accordingly it is possible that additional charges may be recorded as assets are sold or become heldforsale 

 

income from operations 

the following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

  

 items affecting the comparability of our results of operations include i charges associated with our august 2014 and july 2012 restructurings ii subsequent benefits realized as a result of these restructurings and ongoing cost containment efforts iii increased labor costs due to merit increases effective in 2014 and 2013 and iv lower 2012 yearoveryear incentive compensation costs 

solid waste — the comparability of our income from operations for the periods presented is driven by 279 million of net charges primarily related to impairments recognized in 2013 the most significant impairment charges were in our eastern canada area which is included in tier 3 and were associated with the impairment of certain landfills as discussed above in income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items  other significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three years ended december 31 2014 are summarized below 

 

  

 in addition the following items affected comparability of 2014 to 2013 within specific segments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the following items affected comparability of 2013 to 2012 within specific segments 

 

  

  

  

 wheelabrator — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our wheelabrator business in 2014 and 2013 were i a 519 million gain on sale of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 and ii 627 million of pretax charges to impair goodwill and certain wastetoenergy facilities in 2013 as discussed above in goodwill impairments and income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items other items contributing to the variability included i higher yearoveryear electricity prices at our merchant wastetoenergy facilities and ii impairment charges at a wastetoenergy facility as a result of projected operating losses in 2013 

other — our “other” income from operations includes i those elements of our landfill gastoenergy operations and thirdparty subcontract and administration revenues managed by our energy and environmental services and renewable energy organizations that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments ii our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services and iii the results of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings such as portable selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling and in oil and gas producing properties in addition our “other” income from operations reflects the results of nonoperating entities that provide financial assurance and selfinsurance support for our solid waste 

significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

 corporate and other — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

 interest expense net 

our interest expense net was 466 million in 2014 477 million in 2013 and 484 million in 2012 during 2014 the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to i the impacts that lower market interest rates have had on certain of our taxexempt debt ii issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and iii reduced costs associated with our letter of credit facilities due to improvements in the company’s overall credit rating these decreases were partially offset by increases in expense associated with our terminated interest rate swaps due to the maturity of the underlying senior notes in december 2014 the company decided to redeem 947 million of senior notes due in 2015 2017 and 2019 with a weighted average coupon rate of 70 the company incurred a makewhole premium of 130 million to repay these notes with available cash in january 2015 we anticipate that a nearterm refinancing of these debt balances will reduce interest expense in future years 

during 2013 our debt balances increased by approximately 300 million which can generally be attributed to the debt financing of our acquisition of rci offset by debt repayments in spite of this increase in debt we reduced our interest costs by i reducing the interest rate periods of some of our taxexempt bonds allowing us to benefit from lower rates available for shorterterm remarketings ii issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and iii reducing the cost of our revolving credit facility by amending the credit agreement to provide for lower fees and rates 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

we recognized “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of 53 million 34 million and 46 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively these losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility as well as i noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and ii unconsolidated trusts for final capping closure postclosure or environmental obligations the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in lowincome housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in provision for income taxes refer to notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments the expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was impacted by charges of 11 million in 2014 primarily to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value the expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was impacted by a charge of 10 million in 2012 related to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an equity method investment in an unconsolidated entity that went into liquidation 

other net 

we recognized other net expense of 29 million 74 million and 18 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the expenses for 2014 2013 and 2012 were impacted by impairment charges of 22 million 71 million and 16 million respectively related to otherthantemporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies which were accounted for under the cost method we wrote down our investments to their fair value which was primarily determined using an income approach based on estimated 

 

future cash flow projections and to a lesser extent thirdparty investors’ recent transactions in these securities partially offsetting the 2013 charges was a 4 million gain on the sale of a similar investment the remaining expenses recognized during the reported periods are primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded provisions for income taxes of 413 million in 2014 364 million in 2013 and 443 million in 2012 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 236 738 and 340 for the years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes ii the tax implications of divestitures iii federal tax credits iv adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes v tax audit settlements vi the realization of federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards and vii the tax implications of impairments the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we expect our 2015 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 360 based on projected income before income taxes federal tax credits and other permanent items 

 

the tax increase prevention act of 2014 was signed into law on december 19 2014 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance as a result 50 of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before january 1 2015 were depreciated immediately the acceleration of deductions on 2014 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2014 although it will reduce our future cash taxes by approximately 60 million taking accelerated deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken 

noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 40 million in 2014 32 million in 2013 and 43 million in 2012 these amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies “llcs” that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator business in december 2014 we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the llcs from the third parties in anticipation of our sale of the wheelabrator business the llcs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment of our wheelabrator business refer to notes 19 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the sale of our wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities respectively 

the decrease in 2013 is primarily due to the net loss of 10 million attributable to noncontrolling interest holders associated with the 20 million impairment charge related to a majorityowned waste diversion technology company discussed above in income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items  

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2014 and 262 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 and 2013 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2014 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 46 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 23 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

 

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2014 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

  

  the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 in millions 

 

  

    

the tons received at our landfills in 2014 and 2013 are shown below tons in thousands 

 

  

  when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2014 our closed sites management group managed 210 closed landfills 

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2014 and 2013 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2014 in millions 

 

 as of december 31 2014 we estimate that we will spend approximately 400 million in 2015 and approximately 800 million in 2016 and 2017 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2014 and 2013 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2014 in millions 

 

 landfill costs and expenses — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 the comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds with a term approximating the weightedaverage period until settlement of the underlying obligations 

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

 amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis 

 

 different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 252 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v final capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and vii capital expenditures acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and we have also returned value to our shareholders through share repurchases 

 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2014 and 2013 in millions 

 

 cash and cash equivalents — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of shortterm interestbearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase the increase at december 31 2014 is primarily related to the december 2014 sale of our wheelabrator business 

restricted trust and escrow accounts — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations these balances are primarily included within “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets the “other” balance at december 31 2014 includes the 292 million funding of a legal settlement pending final court approval for disbursement 

debt — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2014 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2014 to december 31 2013 were primarily attributable to i the use of cash proceeds from the sale of our wheelabrator business to temporarily repay outstanding borrowings under our 225 billion revolving credit facility ii the use of cash generated from our canadian operations to reduce the balance of our canadian term loan and iii the impacts of other noncash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps foreign currency translation interest accretion and capital leases and other debt obligations 

our current debt balances as of december 31 2014 are primarily related to 947 million of senior notes that the company decided to redeem in advance of their scheduled maturity including 350 million of 6375 senior notes that were scheduled to mature in march 2015 147 million of 7125 senior notes that were scheduled to mature in december 2017 and 450 million of 7375 senior notes that were scheduled to mature in march 2019 we repaid these notes and the related makewhole premium and accrued interest with available cash in january 2015 we anticipate that a nearterm refinancing of these debt balances will reduce interest expense in future years 

 

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit in millions at december 31 categorized by type of facility 

 

  

   summary of cash flow activity 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities — the most significant items affecting the comparisons of our operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 are summarized below 

 

  

  

 after considering these items and certain other noncash items included in our comparative results our earnings drove an improvement in our cash flows from operating activities of approximately 100 million 

 

  

  

 the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2013 as compared with 2012 are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

 net cash provided by used in investing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 net cash used in financing activities — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

 during the third quarter of 2014 we entered into accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 600 million of our common stock at the beginning of the asr repurchase periods we delivered the 600 million in cash and received 96 million shares which represented 70 of the shares expected to be repurchased based on thencurrent market prices these agreements were completed in february 2015 and we received approximately 28 million additional shares the final weighted average per share purchase price for the completed asr agreements was 4858 

we paid 239 million to repurchase 54 million shares of our common stock in 2013 we did not repurchase any shares during 2012 

we announced in february 2015 that the board of directors has authorized up to 1 billion in future share repurchases this authorization is the only currently outstanding authorization for share 

 

repurchases any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations 

 

 we paid an aggregate of 693 million in cash dividends during 2014 compared with 683 million in 2013 and 658 million in 2012 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 0355 in 2012 to 0365 in 2013 and to 0375 in 2014 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding during 2013 and 2014 as a result of our share repurchase programs 

in february 2015 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0375 to 0385 per share for dividends declared in 2015 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 

 

  

  

 during 2014 and 2012 we did not have any significant noncash investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 noncash investing and financing activities included proceeds from taxexempt borrowings net of principal payments made directly from trust funds of 99 million 

 

  

 summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

  

       

liquidity impacts of income tax items 

bonus depreciation — the tax increase prevention act of 2014 was signed into law on december 19 2014 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance as a result 50 of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before january 1 2015 were depreciated immediately the acceleration of deductions on 2014 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2014 although it will reduce our cash taxes by approximately 60 million 

taking accelerated deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken overall the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs resulted in increased cash taxes of 30 million in 2014 separately our tax payments in 2014 were 247 million higher than the tax payments made in 2013 primarily due to i higher pretax earnings ii an anticipated overpayment of taxes and iii divestiture of our puerto rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets 

uncertain tax positions — we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets because the company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity we anticipate that approximately 12 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest and 3 million of related tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months the anticipated reversals primarily relate to state tax items none of which are material and are expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2014 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting standard pending adoption 

in may 2014 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition the amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts the amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the company on january 1 2017 the amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial application we are in the process of assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of diesel fuel have affected our income from operations margins in recent years we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not 

 

expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2014 approximately 30 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount as of december 31 2014 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs which are discussed in the financial assurance and insurance obligations section of item 1 

as of december 31 2014 we had 94 billion of longterm debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives discounts and premiums the effective interest rates of approximately 14 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2015 the most significant components of our variablerate debt obligations are i 501 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process ii 638 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within 12 months and iii 232 million of outstanding advances under our canadian credit facility we currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2015 interest expense by approximately 112 million as of december 31 2013 the effective interest rates of approximately 24 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within 12 months 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our “fixedrate” tax exempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments if any can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately 650 million at december 31 2014 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally 

 

correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate during the three years ended december 31 2014 we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives divested in conjunction with the sale of our wheelabrator business in december 2014 alternatively we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues also increase or decrease 

currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as a cost center in india and investments in hong kong from time to time we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company the foreign currency exposure associated with these investments has not been material refer to notes 8 and 14 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives

we are north america’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services we partner with our residential commercial industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal while recovering valuable resources and creating clean renewable energy our “solid waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection transfer recycling and resource recovery and disposal services through our subsidiaries we are also a leading developer operator and owner of wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states during 2013 our largest customer represented less than 2 of annual revenues we employed approximately 42700 people as of december 31 2013 

we own or operate 267 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in our industry in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities is typically farther we manage 300 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy one method involves recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity our subsidiary wheelabrator technologies inc also uses waste to create energy by operating highly efficient waste combustion plants that produce clean renewable energy we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic metal and electronics we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada in addition to traditional waste operations we are also expanding to increase the service offerings we provide for our customers 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry the waste industry continues to undergo significant changes our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource when compared to historical averages landfill volumes have declined in recent years as customers are increasingly using alternatives to 

  

index to financial statements traditional disposal such as recycling while also working to reduce the waste they generate accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  we believe that helping our customers achieve their environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth 

every day waste management is helping industries communities and individuals reduce reuse and remove waste better through sound sustainability strategies we have a precise daytoday focus on collecting and handling our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly meanwhile we are also developing and implementing new ways to handle and extract value from waste our employees are committed to delivering environmental performance — our mission is to maximize resource value while minimizing environmental impact so that both our economy and our environment can thrive drawing on our resources and experience we actively pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry the customers and communities we serve and the environment 

the company is also committed to providing longterm value to our stockholders by successfully executing on our strategic goals of optimizing our business knowing and servicing the customer better than anyone else and extracting more value from the materials we handle in pursuit of these longterm goals we have sharpened our focus on the following key priorities 

 

  

  

 we believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry as customers increasingly seek nontraditional waste management solutions in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and our board of directors has given management authority to make common stock repurchases in february 2014 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0365 to 0375 per share for dividends declared in 2014 which is a 27 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2013 this will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the 11 th consecutive year and is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors 

operations 

general 

we evaluate oversee and manage the financial performance of our local solid waste business subsidiaries through our 17 areas see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments our wheelabrator business provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste or wheelabrator businesses as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

we have expanded certain of our operations through acquisitions which are discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in january 2013 we acquired greenstar llc “greenstar” an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities this acquisition provides the company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions having supplemented the company’s extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers in july 2013 we acquired substantially all of the assets of rci environnement inc “rci” the largest waste management company in quebec and certain related entities rci provides collection transfer recycling and disposal operations throughout the greater montreal area the acquired rci operations complement and expand the company’s existing assets and operations in quebec 

  

index to financial statements the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by our solid waste and wheelabrator businesses in the threeyear period ended december 31 2013 more information about our results of operations is included in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

 the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer operation of wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years presented 

 

 collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

   

index to financial statements landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2013 we owned or operated 262 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and as a result thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer at december 31 2013 we owned or operated 300 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites at december 31 2013 our medical waste services business discussed below also had 15 smaller transfer operations separate from its 8 processing facilities but some of which are located at other existing company facilities that are permitted to consolidate regulated medical waste collections for disposal 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

  

index to financial statements wheelabrator as of december 31 2013 we owned or operated 16 wastetoenergy facilities and four independent power production plants “ipps” which are located in the northeast in the midatlantic and in florida california and washington 

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam as of december 31 2013 our wastetoenergy facilities were capable of processing up to approximately 23000 tons of solid waste each day in 2013 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 8 million tons of solid waste or approximately 21000 tons per day 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

we generate steam at our wastetoenergy and ipps facilities for the production of electricity we sell the electricity produced at our facilities into wholesale markets which include investorowned utilities power marketers and regional power pools some of our facilities also sell steam directly to end users fees charged for electricity and steam at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps have generally been subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market conditions such as inflation electricity prices and other general market factors in recent years several of our longterm energy contracts and shortterm pricing arrangements expired significantly increasing our wastetoenergy revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in market prices for electricity which generally correlate with fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets in which we operate our marketprice volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire we use shortterm “receive fixed pay variable” electricity commodity swaps to reduce the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity refer to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section of this report for additional information about the company’s current considerations related to the management of this market exposure 

in 2013 we continued to look at opportunities to expand our wastetoenergy business in recent years we have partnered with third parties to invest in the expansion of wastetoenergy assets and services in the united kingdom and china while there has not been any meaningful expansion of the network of wastetoenergy disposal facilities in the us during this time we have invested significant efforts in europe and china to further develop these assets we have made investments in partnerships and joint ventures in the united kingdom and china in order to use our expertise as an owner and operator of wastetoenergy facilities to participate in this growth opportunity the investments we have made are discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage in 2001 we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing we operate 120 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale we also operate five secondary processing facilities where recyclable materials can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods materials processing services include data destruction and automated color sorting 

  

index to financial statements plastics materials recycling — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

commodities recycling — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of recyclable commodities being processed the volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the processed goods to our customers to whom we sell such materials the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods and on market conditions but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled fiber can significantly affect our revenues the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our operating income from operations margins 

other other services we provide include the following 

we provide recycling brokerage services which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements we also provide electronics recycling we recycle discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials in recent years we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “takeback” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner 

our wm sustainability services organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our area and strategic accounts programs including i inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services ii specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations and iii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the epa endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2013 we had 137 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 124 of our solid waste landfills and four thirdparty landfills at 109 of these landfills the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 17 landfills the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at 10 landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers at one landfill the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel 

  

index to financial statements although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts program works with customers whose locations span the united states our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs in 2011 we acquired oakleaf global holdings and its primary operations “oakleaf” which provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of thirdparty haulers oakleaf has increased our strategic accounts customer base and enhanced our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions 

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology part of our expansion of services includes offering portable selfstorage services fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program and a sharps mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose of their used syringes and lancets using our medwaste tracker ® system in addition we have made investments that involve the acquisition and development of interests in oil and gas producing properties finally we rent portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  we service such facilities and we provide street and parking lot sweeping services 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

seasonal trends 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while 

  

index to financial statements weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins 

employees 

at december 31 2013 we had approximately 42700 fulltime employees of which approximately 7400 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 9200 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills 

we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2013 

 

  

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

 the assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the closure postclosure and remedial obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established other than these permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability business interruption and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2013 our commercial general liability insurance policy carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 25 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2013 our auto liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 5 million subject to additional deductibles of 48 million in the 5 million to 10 million layer we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2013 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage often referred to as “side b” the side a policy covers directors and officers directly for loss 

  

index to financial statements including defense costs when corporate indemnification is unavailable side aonly coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the company as the company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers 

regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us environmental protection agency “epa” environment canada and various other federal state provincial and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue 

because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local rules there are costs associated with siting design permitting operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a management or disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

 the epa has also issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years the epa has not initiated or announced a schedule for the required review of the standards for large wastetoenergy facilities so we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with possible regulatory revisions 

additionally standards have been imposed on manufacturers of transportation vehicles including waste collection vehicles the epa continues to evaluate and develop regulations to increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions such regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet but we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole 

 

   

index to financial statements  we are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in united states federal regulations affecting our business 

 

  

   

index to financial statements state provincial and local regulations 

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

our landfill and wastetoenergy operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility “epr” are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in canada and the us epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

foreign export regulation 

enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics the higher quality expectations 

  

index to financial statements resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry particularly for single stream mrfs single stream mrfs process a wide range of materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of the material being scrutinized by the chinese government which resulted in increased processing and residual disposal costs despite these increased costs we believe we are well positioned among our potential competitors to respond to and comply with such regulations we are revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle properly 

hydraulic fracturing regulation 

our energy service line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations recently there has been increased attention from the public some states and the epa on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services on the other hand we believe the size capital structure regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services 

emissions from natural gas fueling and infrastructure 

we currently operate the largest compressed natural gas “cng” fleet in the waste industry and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to cng we have constructed and operate 58 natural gas fueling stations 27 of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties in 24 states and two canadian provinces concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles we have partnered with the environmental organization environmental defense fund as well as other heavyduty equipment users and experts on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers we anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavyduty fleet may ultimately result in regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry additional regulation of or restrictions on cng fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our current plan to continue transitioning to cng vehicles 

federal state and local climate change initiatives 

in light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their ghg emissions as part of our ongoing marketing evaluations we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions such as waste reduction increased recycling and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel we use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider we are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints we understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices in addition we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable lowcarbon fuels and electricity 

we continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events we are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events 

  

index to financial statements tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of similar nature and generally include statements containing 

 

  

  

  

 you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2014 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview for more information on our business strategy 

  

index to financial statements there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

compliance with existing or future regulations andor enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount 

  

index to financial statements of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste certain types of flow control or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

additionally regulations establishing extended producer responsibility or epr are being considered or implemented in many places around the world including in canada and the us epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the postuse life cycle of the products they create along with the funding responsibility producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure there is no federal law establishing epr in the us or canada however state provincial and local governments could and in some cases have taken steps to implement epr regulations if wideranging epr regulations were adopted they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business including contract terms and pricing a significant reduction in the waste recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

index to financial statements enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products in 2013 the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and nonconforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “operation green fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry particularly for single stream mrfs single stream mrfs process a wide range of materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of the material being scrutinized by the chinese government which resulted in increased processing and residual disposal costs if operation green fence or other similar regulations increase our operating costs in the future and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our revenues earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities particularly demand from chinese paper mills can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively as we have experienced in 2012 and 2013 or positively as we experienced in 2011 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the decline in market prices in 2013 and 2012 for commodities resulted in yearoveryear decreases in revenue of 79 million and 428 million respectively in 2011 increases in the prices of recycling commodities resulted in a yearoveryear increase in revenue of 216 million overall commodity prices decreased yearoveryear 5 and 25 in 2013 and 2012 respectively and prices increased yearoveryear 18 in 2011 these prices may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated 

there are also significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations that can significantly impact our revenue from yield provided by such businesses in most of the markets in which we operate electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 56 56 and 54 respectively of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates our wastetoenergy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire we may not be able to enter into renewal contracts on comparable or favorable terms or at all if we are unable to successfully negotiate longterm contracts or if market prices are at lower levels for sustained periods our revenues earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or wastetoenergy facility some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as affecting the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services our landfills and our wastetoenergy facilities currently provide and have historically provided our highest income from operations margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings 

  

index to financial statements and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results will decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is reasonably possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or power production to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space and wastetoenergy facilities as a result our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be 

  

index to financial statements unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

 we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

further we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties due to the downturn in the economy reduced tax revenue andor high cost structures some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

  

index to financial statements in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2013 we had 577 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and 939 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns average diesel fuel prices decreased in 2013 but increased in both 2012 and 2011 we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally we are currently party to pending litigation that pertains to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices and generally alleges that such charges were not properly disclosed were unfair and were contrary to customer service contracts see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins 

we are expanding our compressed natural gas “cng” truck fleet which makes us increasingly dependent on the availability of cng and cng fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to cng prices 

we currently operate the largest cng fleet in the waste industry and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to cng however cng is not yet broadly available in north america as a result we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations some of which also serve the public or preapproved third parties until the public and third parties in north america broadly adopt cng which may not be on the timetable we anticipate it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in cng fueling infrastructure in order to power our cng fleet concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gasfueled vehicles new regulation of or restrictions on cng fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs 

  

index to financial statements additionally fluctuations in the price and supply of cng could substantially increase our operating expenses and a reduction in the existing cost differential between cng and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in cng vehicles further our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices and price fluctuations for cng may not effectively be recovered by this program 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we are a participating employer in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements the risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer plans in that i assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other participating employers ii if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan 

  

index to financial statements may be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and iii if we choose to stop participating in any of our multiemployer plans we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the plan 

in connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans further business events such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract the decertification of a union or relocation reduction or discontinuance of certain operations which result in the decline of company contributions to a multiemployer pension plan could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal in the event of a withdrawal we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan the ongoing solvency of participating employers the investment returns obtained on plan assets and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation depending on such factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular reporting period we reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet 

we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 5 million in 2013 and 10 million in 2012 we are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for certain withdrawals which could be higher than the charges we have recognized 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

providing environmental and waste management services including constructing and operating landfills involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures mass instability or waste slides severe weather and natural disasters which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials and odors injury or death of employees and others or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken additionally we have built and are operating cng fueling stations to serve our growing fleet of cng trucks some of which also serve the public or third parties operation of fueling stations landfill gas collection and control systems and waste to energy plants involves additional risks of fire and explosion all of these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages personal injury loss of life business interruption and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training and compliance programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

  

index to financial statements in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations our financial position which can be negatively affected by asset impairments our credit profile and general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

in accordance with gaap we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit additionally declining waste volumes and development of and customer preference for alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or fail to maintain our desired credit profile 

if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile as well as a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control including methodologies established and interpreted by third party rating agencies if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 24 billion of debt as of december 31 2013 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility and canadian credit facility and term loan if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow 

  

index to financial statements we may use our 225 billion revolving credit facility and our c150 million canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until maturity in july 2018 and november 2017 respectively as of december 31 2013 we had 420 million of outstanding borrowings and 872 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the 225 billion revolving credit facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 958 million and we had 9 million of borrowings under the canadian revolving credit facility in the event of a default under our credit facilities we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lowercarbon service options the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation 

on october 1 2013 the supreme court granted petitions for certiorari to consider whether the epa’s regulation of ghg emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the clean air act if the supreme court decides that permitting requirements were triggered for ghgs and if certain changes to these regulations are enacted such as the lowering of thresholds or inclusion of biogenic emissions such amendments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows that would not be mitigated by increased revenues associated with the services we offer customers to reduce their ghg footprints 

changes in oil and gas prices and drilling activity and changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our energy service business 

we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations demand for these services may be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control including changes in oil and gas prices additionally changes in laws or government regulations regarding ghg emissions from oil and gas operations andor hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers recently there has been increased attention from the public some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services 

  

index to financial statements the seasonal nature of our business severe weather events and “onetime” special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends the operating results of our first quarter often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

service disruptions caused by severe storms extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas on the other hand certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

the construction of new international wastetoenergy facilities is subject to many business risks and uncertainties that could cause such projects to fail to achieve the financial results anticipated 

our wheelabrator business has invested in growing its wastetoenergy business in china and europe through partnerships and joint ventures established to develop construct andor operate new facilities development and construction of a wastetoenergy facility is a complex capital intensive longterm process subject to risks of delays cost overruns failure to receive governmental or regulatory approvals and financing difficulty additionally technology incorporated in such facilities may not perform as anticipated any of these risks among others may cause such projects to fail to achieve the financial results anticipated which could have a negative impact on our operating results 

additionally the financing development construction and operation of projects outside the united states can entail significant political and financial risks which vary by country including

 the legal and financial environment in foreign countries could also make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights under agreements any or all of the risks identified above with respect to our international projects could adversely affect our revenue and cash generation 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

 we experienced notably stronger free cash flow in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to improvements in cash flow from operations primarily as a result of our pricing discipline in 2013 we delivered on our prior expectation related to pricing with internal revenue growth from yield at its highest level for the year in the fourth quarter and greater than 20 for the full year for the first time since 2010 our cash flow also benefitted from our increased focus on capital spending management and we continued to see the anticipated benefits from our cost savings programs including lower selling general and administrative costs when compared to 2012 further we increased the amount we returned to stockholders in 2013 compared to 2012 by increasing our dividend and repurchasing shares our fourth quarter and full year results for 2013 have laid a foundation that we expect will benefit us in 2014 allowing us to focus on generating solid earnings and cash flow driven by increased yield and cost controls we also expect to continue to use our free cash flow to pay our dividends repurchase shares reduce debt and make appropriate acquisitions and investments in our traditional solid waste business 

free cash flow 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity nevertheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 

 

   

index to financial statements  

 when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013 to the comparable period in 2012 the increase of 160 million was primarily related to the impact of higher cash earnings favorable impacts of working capital changes and the payment of 59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in september 2012 the increase was partially offset by an increase in tax payments of 145 million and the favorable cash receipt of 72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in april 2012 

when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 to the comparable period in 2011 the decrease of 174 million was primarily related to the impact of lower cash earnings an increase in tax payments of 63 million the payment of 59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in september 2012 and unfavorable impacts of working capital changes the decrease was partially offset by a favorable cash receipt of 72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in april 2012 

the decrease in capital expenditures when comparing the year ended december 31 2013 to the comparable period can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management the increase in capital expenditures when comparing the year ended december 31 2012 to the comparable period in 2011 is a result of our increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles related fueling infrastructure and growth initiatives and the impact of timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending we generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital spending in the fourth quarter of each year a more significant portion of our fourth quarter 2011 spending was paid in cash in 2012 than in the preceding year 

acquisitions 

greenstar llc — on january 31 2013 we paid 170 million inclusive of certain adjustments to acquire greenstar llc “greenstar” pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement up to an additional 40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018 of which 20 million is guaranteed the remaining 20 million of this consideration is contingent based on changes in certain recyclable commodity indexes and had a preliminary estimated fair value at closing of 16 million greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities this acquisition provides the company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers since the acquisition date the greenstar business has recognized revenues of 139 million and net losses of 17 million which are included in our consolidated statement of operations

index to financial statements basis of presentation of consolidated financial information 

comprehensive income — in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income which requires companies to provide information about the amounts that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component additionally companies are required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income the amendment to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income was effective for the company on january 1 2013 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we have presented the information required by this amendment in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income which requires companies to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income were effective for the company on january 1 2012 and have been applied retrospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing — in july 2012 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing the amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is not required to take further action the amendments were effective for indefinitelived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 however early adoption was permitted the company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements additional information on impairment testing can be found in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be 

  

index to financial statements amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 25 landfill sites with expansions included at december 31 2013 seven landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace three of these landfills required approval by our chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining four landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one or fiveyear requirements 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor “auf” is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent 

  

index to financial statements multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

  

  

 asset impairments 

our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment on a nonrecurring basis and test the recoverability of such assets using significant unobservable “level 3” inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 

  

index to financial statements carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “goodwill impairments” and “income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items” line items in our consolidated statement of operations estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as described below 

landfills — the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions — expansion airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit at december 31 2013 one of our landfill sites for which we believe receipt of the expansion permit is probable is not currently accepting waste the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for this site was 261 million at december 31 2013 we performed a test of recoverability for this landfill and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying value of this site during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion andor development of such landfills these charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our eastern canada area which are no longer accepting waste we had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable however in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis which was influenced in some cases by our acquisition of rci we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations as a result of management’s decision we determined that the carrying values of landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets as such we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to landfill asset impairments recognized during the reported periods 

  

index to financial statements goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted on a nonrecurring basis we assess our goodwill for impairment using level 3 inputs 

we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we will not perform a quantitative assessment 

if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit the first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units 

as a result of our annual fourth quarter impairment tests for our wheelabrator business during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in the second quarter of 2012 we believed an impairment indicator existed such that the fair value of our wheelabrator business could potentially be less than its carrying amount because of the negative effect on our revenues of the continued deterioration of electricity commodity prices coupled with our continued increased exposure to market prices as a result of the expiration of several longterm fixedrate electricity commodity contracts at our wastetoenergy and independent power facilities and the expiration of several longterm disposal contracts at abovemarket rates we performed the interim quantitative assessment using both an income and a market approach in the second quarter of 2012 which indicated that the estimated fair value of our wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2012 we again performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill balances which indicated that the estimated fair value of our wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 compared to an excess of 30 at our annual fourth quarter 2011 test this quantitative assessment was performed using both an income and market approach 

during 2013 we noted no indicators of impairment that required us to perform an interim impairment test however during our annual impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of our wheelabrator business had declined and the associated goodwill was impaired as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 483 million which had no related tax benefit we estimated the implied fair value of our wheelabrator reporting unit goodwill using a combination of income and market approaches because the annual impairment test indicated that wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value we performed the “step two” analysis in the “step two” analysis the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated including tangible assets power contracts customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the 

  

index to financial statements carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment the factors contributing to the 483 million goodwill impairment charge principally relate to the continued challenging business environment in areas of the country in which wheelabrator operates characterized by lower available disposal volumes which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue as well as the amount of electricity wheelabrator is able to generate lower electricity pricing due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as our facilities age these factors caused us relative to the 2012 impairment test to lower assumptions for electricity and disposal revenue and increase assumed operating costs additionally the discount factor utilized in the income approach increased relative to that utilized in 2012 mainly due to increases in interest rates if market prices for electricity are lower than our projections our disposal volumes or rates decline our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts or our costs of capital increase the estimated fair value of our wheelabrator business could further decrease and potentially result in an additional impairment charge in a future period we will continue to monitor our wheelabrator business and the recoverability of the remaining 305 million goodwill balance 

as a result of our annual fourth quarter impairment tests for our eastern canada area during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in 2013 and 2012 our annual goodwill impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair value of our eastern canada area exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15 and 5 respectively these quantitative assessments were performed using both an income and market approach if we do not achieve our anticipated disposal volumes our collection or disposal rates decline our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts costs of capital increase or we do not receive anticipated landfill expansions the estimated fair value of our eastern canada area could decrease and potentially result in an impairment charge in a future period we will continue to monitor our eastern canada area 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — goodwill impairments and notes 6 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods 

indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 

when performing the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired if we believe an impairment has occurred we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value 

fair value is typically estimated using an income approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business 

fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available 

  

index to financial statements evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer recycling and resource recovery and wastetoenergy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or mrf and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel our wastetoenergy revenues which are generated by our wheelabrator business are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam our “other” lines of business include wm sustainability business services our landfill gastoenergy operations portolet ® services portable selfstorage fluorescent lamp recycling and oil and gas producing properties intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements these operations are presented as “other” in the table below shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year by reportable segment 

 

   

index to financial statements the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

 our revenues increased 334 million or 24 and 271 million or 20 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the yearoveryear change in revenues for both periods has been driven by i acquisitions particularly the acquisitions of greenstar in january 2013 and rci in july 2013 which increased revenues by 138 million and 80 million respectively and the acquisition of oakleaf in july 2011 which increased revenues by 314 million for 2012 ii increased revenue growth from our collection and disposal average yield iii higher revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program iv market factors including fluctuations in electricity prices at our merchant wastetoenergy facilities that favorably affected our revenues in 2013 but negatively affected our revenues in 2012 recyclable commodity prices that negatively affected 

  

index to financial statements revenues in both 2013 and 2012 and foreign currency translation which negatively affected revenues from our canadian operations in both 2013 and 2012 and v lower volumes which drove revenue declines in 2013 while higher volumes drove revenue increases in 2012 

the following provides further details associated with our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer landfill and wastetoenergy disposal operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield during both years includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 235 million or 21 and 86 million or 08 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively this revenue growth from yield in 2013 was primarily driven by an aggressive pricing strategy which decreased the dollar impact of rollbacks associated with those price increases and improved pricing on our new business primarily in our collection operations with growth of 232 million for the year ended december 31 2013 we experienced growth in all three of our principal collection lines of business in both 2013 and 2012 as follows 

 

 while our collection line of business was the primary driver of the yearoveryear yield growth in both periods presented our 2013 growth was more significant than our growth during 2012 this was driven in part by our more aggressive pricing strategy implemented in 2013 conversely our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy with more significant volume declines during 2013 however our pricing actions and our focus on controlling variable costs have consistently provided margin improvements in our collection line of business 

part of the yearoveryear revenue growth from yield in 2013 is attributable to the new regulatory cost recovery fee that we instituted in april 2013 to help us recover a portion of the significant regulatory costs and fees such as host fees and disposal taxes which have not been recouped by our pricing programs this new fee contributed approximately 43 million to our revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2013 principally in our collection business with the most significant impact in our commercial collection line of business additionally revenue growth from yield in our industrial line of business was aided by our continued expansion in the energy service business which typically has higher average rates due to extended transportation distances special waste handling costs and higher disposal costs with respect to our residential line of business we are focused on bidding on contracts that improve our yield performance and increase our overall returns our effort to increase yield in our residential line of business is a challenge due principally to a very competitive environment a high percentage of our residential business is in municipal franchise markets and many municipalities are facing significant budget challenges which results in very competitive bid processes as we rebid contracts and try to win new contracts finally yield growth from our landfill and transfer station operations also increased for both 2013 and 2012 improving yield in our landfill business has proved to be a challenge due in part to excess disposal capacity that exists in many of the markets in which we own or operate landfills 

  

index to financial statements the expiration and renegotiation of two longterm wastetoenergy disposal contracts in south florida at lower rates negatively impacted our revenue growth from yield in our wastetoenergy line of business by 6 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the yearoveryear negative impact from the renegotiated contracts will continue through the first half of 2014 

revenues from our environmental fee which are included in average yield on collection and disposal totaled 344 million in both 2013 and 2012 and 303 million in 2011 revenue increase from environmental fees flattened as we did not implement fee increases in 2013 commensurate with the prior year additionally as mentioned above we instituted a new regulatory cost recovery fee in april 2013 that contributed approximately 43 million to revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2013 

recycling commodities — yearoveryear commodity price declines of approximately 5 and 25 resulted in decreased revenues of 79 million and 428 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the estimated negative impact on income from operations was approximately 20 million and 130 million for years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased by 32 million and 33 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively these revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based although we experienced lower yearoveryear average fuel prices in 2013 our fuel surcharge revenues increased as a result of a revision of the surcharge calculation implemented to better capture price increases intended to be recovered by the surcharge the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to passthrough fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations 

volume — changes in our volume caused our revenue to decrease 133 million or 10 for the year ended december 31 2013 this is a notable decrease when compared to our revenue increase on account of volume of 67 million or 05 for the year ended december 31 2012 our volume fluctuations are generally attributable to economic conditions pricing changes competition and diversion of waste by customers our collection business experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes in both periods presented collection business revenue declines due to lower volumes were 170 million for 2013 and 65 million in 2012 our more aggressive pricing strategy during 2013 was a significant contributor to the higher volume declines 

other drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions — revenues increased 292 million and 535 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively due to acquisitions in 2013 the revenue increase due to acquisition was principally associated with the acquisition of greenstar which is reported in our “recycling” line of business and the acquisition of rci which is reported primarily in our “collection” line of business in 2012 the significant revenue increase due to acquisitions was principally associated with oakleaf included in our “other” business 

  

index to financial statements which anniversaried in july 2012 additionally in 2012 acquisitions increased our revenues in our collection line of business due in part to our energy service and recycling lines of business these acquisitions demonstrate our focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new complementary lines of business 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees contingent landfill lease payments and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include auto liability workers’ compensation general liability and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include telecommunications equipment and facility rent property taxes utilities and supplies 

our operating expenses increased 233 million or 26 when comparing 2013 with 2012 and increased 338 million or 40 when comparing 2012 with 2011 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 652 in 2013 651 in 2012 and 638 in 2011 the increases in our operating expenses during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 can largely be attributed to the following 

acquisitions — during the three years ended december 31 2013 we made three acquisitions that were the most significant drivers of our operating expense increases in january 2013 we acquired greenstar an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities the acquisition primarily increased cost of goods sold and to a lesser extent labor and related benefits and other categories in july 2013 we acquired rci a waste management company comprised of collection transfer recycling and disposal operations the acquisition increased operating costs primarily in subcontractor costs and to a lesser extent cost of goods sold the oakleaf acquisition contributed to higher operating costs in 2012 when compared to the prior year period primarily impacting subcontractor costs the increase in operating expenses was incurred in connection with the related acquisition revenues discussed above in operating revenues

 selling general and administrative 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefit costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 4 million or 03 and decreased by 79 million or 51 when comparing 2013 with 2012 and 2012 with 2011 respectively our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 105 in 2013 108 in 2012 and 116 in 2011 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

   

index to financial statements labor and related benefits  — factors affecting the yearoveryear changes in our labor and related benefits costs include 

 

  

  

 professional fees — consulting fees declined year over year as companywide initiatives which began in 2011 were implemented partially offset by higher legal fees in 2012 as compared with 2013 and 2011 

provision for bad debts — our provision for bad debts decreased in 2013 as a result of the collection of certain fully reserved receivables related to our puerto rico operations additionally many of the billing delay issues we experienced throughout fiscal year 2012 with certain of our strategic account customers have been resolved favorably affecting our yearoveryear bad debt comparisons 

other — in 2013 controllable costs associated with i building and equipment ii advertising iii computer and telecommunication iv travel and entertainment and v seminars and education have declined primarily as a result of our july 2012 restructuring and continued focus on costcontrol initiatives in 2012 we experienced decreases in i litigation settlement costs and ii insurance and claims these decreases were partially offset by increases in i computer and telecommunications costs due in part to improvements we are making to our information technology systems and ii building and equipment costs which include rental and utilities 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life using either a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

   

index to financial statements the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2013 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of rci the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2012 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of oakleaf in 2011 and by our areas located in the northern us 

restructuring 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized a total of 18 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs including costs associated with our acquisitions of greenstar and rci and our 2012 restructurings the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized we do not expect to incur any material charges associated with our past restructuring efforts in future periods 

in july 2012 we announced a reorganization of operations designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure while not disrupting our frontline operations principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic groups each of which previously constituted a reportable segment and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic areas through which we evaluate and oversee our solid waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17 this reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the company including positions at both the management and support level voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized a total of 67 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 56 million were primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with our july 2012 restructuring the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

goodwill impairments 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 509 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to i 483 million associated with our wheelabrator business ii 10 million associated with our puerto rico operations and iii 9 million associated with a majorityowned waste diversion technology company during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 4 million and 1 million respectively related to certain of our nonsolid waste operations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical estimates and assumptions — asset impairments and notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

   

index to financial statements during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized net charges of 464 million primarily related to the following 

 

  

  

  

 during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized impairment charges aggregating 79 million attributable to i 45 million of charges related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities ii 20 million of charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies and iii other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values all of which are individually immaterial 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized impairment charges relating to two facilities in our medical waste services business in addition to the three facilities impaired in 2012 discussed above as a result of the closure of one site and continuing operating losses at the other site 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions — asset impairments for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments 

in addition to the impairments discussed above we are continuing to evaluate opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of underperforming assets or assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives accordingly it is possible that additional charges may be recorded as assets are sold or become heldforsale 

  

index to financial statements income from operations 

the following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

  

 items affecting the comparability of our results of operations during 2013 and 2012 include i restructuring charges recognized in 2012 associated with our july 2012 restructuring ii subsequent benefits realized as a result of our july 2012 restructuring and ongoing cost containment efforts iii increased labor costs due to merit increases effective in 2013 and 2011 and iv lower 2012 yearoveryear incentive compensation payouts also affecting comparability excluding wheelabrator was the reclassification of employees to solid waste from other and corporate and other  

solid waste — our solid waste business income from operations declined 191 million when comparing 2013 with 2012 principally as a result of 279 million of net charges primarily related to impairments recognized in 2013 the most significant impairment charges were in our eastern canada area which is included in tier 3 and were associated with the impairment of certain landfills as discussed above in income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items  other significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three years ended december 31 2013 are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements wheelabrator — the decrease in income from operations of our wheelabrator business for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 2012 was largely driven by i 627 million of pretax charges to impair goodwill and certain wastetoenergy facilities as discussed above in goodwill impairments and income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items iii higher labor costs and iv a disposal surcharge at one of our wastetoenergy facilities the impact of these unfavorable items was offset in part by improved energy pricing and metal sales 

the decrease in income from operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 was largely driven by i lower revenues due to the expiration of longterm contracts at certain of our wastetoenergy facilities ii lower energy pricing at our merchant facilities iii increased maintenance and repair costs primarily due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance activities and iv increased international development costs 

other — our “other” income from operations includes i those elements of our inplant services landfill gastoenergy operations and thirdparty subcontract and administration revenues managed by our sustainability services and renewable energy organizations that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments ii our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services and iii the results of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings such as portable selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling and in oil and gas producing properties in addition our “other” income from operations reflects the results of i nonoperating entities that provide financial assurance and selfinsurance support for our solid waste business and ii reclasses to include the costs of our former geographic group offices that prior to our 2012 restructuring were included in our operating segments

 corporate and other — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

 interest expense 

our interest expense was 481 million in 2013 488 million in 2012 and 481 million in 2011 during 2013 our debt balances increased by approximately 300 million which can generally be attributed to the debt financing of our acquisition of rci offset by debt repayments in spite of this increase in debt we reduced our interest costs by i reducing the interest rate periods of some of our taxexempt bonds allowing us to benefit 

  

index to financial statements from lower rates available for shorterterm remarketings ii issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and iii reducing the cost of our revolving credit facility by amending the credit agreement to provide for lower fees and rates the increase in interest expense from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher average debt balances which were incurred to support acquisitions and investments in our longterm growth and a decrease in the benefits provided by active and terminated interest rate swap agreements these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest due to i a decline in our weighted average borrowing rate achieved by refinancing matured debt with new borrowings at much lower fixed interest rates and ii the impacts that lower market interest rates had on the cost of certain of our taxexempt debt 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

we recognized “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of 34 million in 2013 46 million in 2012 and 31 million in 2011 these losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility as well as i noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and ii unconsolidated trusts for final capping closure postclosure or environmental obligations the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in lowincome housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in provision for income taxes refer to notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments the decrease in 2013 is primarily attributable to the recognition of a 10 million charge in 2012 related to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an unconsolidated entity that went into liquidation this investment was accounted for under the equity method 

other net 

we recognized other net expense of 74 million 18 million and 4 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the expense in 2013 was impacted by impairment charges of 71 million relating to otherthantemporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies accounted for under the cost method we wrote down the carrying value of our investments to their fair value which was primarily determined using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections obtained in the fourth quarter of 2013 and to a lesser extent thirdparty investors’ recent transactions in these securities partially offsetting these charges was a 4 million gain on the sale of a similar investment 

the expense in 2012 was impacted by an impairment charge of 16 million related to an otherthantemporary decline in the value of an investment in a waste diversion technology company accounted for under the cost method we wrote down the carrying value of our investment to its fair value based on other thirdparty investors’ recent transactions in these securities which are considered to be the best evidence of fair value currently available the remaining expenses recognized during the reported periods are primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded provisions for income taxes of 364 million in 2013 443 million in 2012 and 511 million in 2011 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 738 340 and 336 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes ii federal tax credits  iii tax audit settlements iv the realization of federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards and v the tax implications of impairments the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

 we expect our 2014 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 350 based on projected income levels federal tax credits and other permanent items 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2 2013 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance as a result 50 of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before january 1 2014 were depreciated immediately the acceleration of deductions on 2013 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2013 however the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our 2013 cash taxes by approximately 70 million taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken 

noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 32 million in 2013 43 million in 2012 and 48 million in 2011 these amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator business refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the consolidation of these variable interest entities the decrease in 2013 is primarily due to the net loss of 10 million attributable to noncontrolling interest holders associated with the 20 million impairment charge related to a majorityowned waste diversion technology company discussed above in income expense from divestitures asset impairments other than goodwill and unusual items  

  

index to financial statements landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 262 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2013 and 264 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 and 2012 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2013 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 46 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 25 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2013 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

  

    

index to financial statements the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 in millions 

 

  

  

  

 the tons received at our landfills in 2013 and 2012 are shown below tons in thousands 

 

  

   

index to financial statements  when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2013 our closed sites management group managed 212 closed landfills 

landfill assets — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2013 and 2012 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2013 in millions 

 

 as of december 31 2013 we estimate that we will spend approximately 400 million in 2014 and approximately 800 million in 2015 and 2016 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

  

index to financial statements the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2013 and 2012 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2013 in millions 

 

 landfill costs and expenses — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 the comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds with a term approximating the weightedaverage period until settlement of the underlying obligations 

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

 amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

  

index to financial statements the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis 

 

 different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 267 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v final capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and vii capital expenditures acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and we have also returned value to our shareholders through share repurchases

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2013 and 2012 in millions 

 

   

index to financial statements cash and cash equivalents — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less our cash and cash equivalents have decreased as a result of the execution of our strategic growth plans primarily due to acquisitions 

restricted trust and escrow accounts — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

debt — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2013 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2013 to december 31 2012 were primarily attributable to i net debt borrowings of 155 million and ii the impacts of accounting for other noncash changes in our debt balances due to taxexempt bond issuances hedge accounting for interest rate swaps foreign currency translation interest accretion and capital leases and other debt obligations 

as of december 31 2013 we had i 481 million of debt maturing within the next 12 months including 350 million of 50 senior notes that mature in march 2014 and 67 million of taxexempt bonds ii shortterm borrowings and advances outstanding under credit facilities with longterm maturities including 420 million of borrowings outstanding under the 225 billion revolving credit facility and 9 million of advances under our canadian credit facility and iii 939 million of taxexempt borrowings subject to repricing within the next 12 months based on our intent and ability to refinance a portion of this debt on a longterm basis as of december 31 2013 including through use of forecasted available capacity under our 225 billion revolving credit facility we have classified 11 billion of this debt as longterm and the remaining 726 million as current obligations

 we paid an aggregate of 683 million in cash dividends during 2013 compared with 658 million in 2012 and 637 million in 2011 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 034 in 2011 to 0355 in 2012 and to 0365 in 2013 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding during 2011 and 2013 as a result of our share repurchase programs 

we paid 239 million and 575 million for share repurchases in 2013 and 2011 respectively we repurchased approximately 5 million shares of our common stock in 2013 and approximately 17 million shares of our common stock in 2011 we did not repurchase any shares during 2012 

in february 2014 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0365 to 0375 per share for dividends declared in 2014 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant additionally in december 2012 the board of directors authorized up to 500 million in share repurchases and we repurchased 239 million of our common stock pursuant to that authorization in 2013 in february 2014 the board of directors authorized up to 600 million in future share repurchases this authorization both replaces and increases the amount that remained available for share repurchases under the prior authorization any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations

index to financial statements liquidity impacts of income tax items 

bonus depreciation — the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2 2013 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance as a result 50 of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before january 1 2014 were depreciated immediately the acceleration of deductions on 2013 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2013 although it reduced our cash taxes 

the acceleration of depreciation deductions related to qualifying capital expenditures in 2013 decreased our 2013 cash taxes by approximately 70 million however taking accelerated depreciation deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the depreciation deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken overall the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs results in increased cash taxes of 40 million in 2013 separately our tax payments in 2013 were 145 million higher than the tax payments made in 2012 

uncertain tax positions — we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets because the company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity we anticipate that approximately 9 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest and 3 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months the anticipated reversals are related to state tax items none of which are material and are expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2013 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of diesel fuel have affected our income from operations margins in recent years we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2013 approximately 30 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount as of december 31 2013 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 

interest rate exposure — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs which are discussed in the financial assurance and insurance obligations section of item 1 

  

index to financial statements as of december 31 2013 we had 102 billion of longterm debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives discounts and premiums the effective interest rates of approximately 24 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2014 the most significant components of our variablerate debt obligations are i 577 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process ii 939 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within 12 months iii 420 million of borrowings outstanding under our 225 billion revolving credit facility and iv 414 million of outstanding advances under our canadian credit facility we currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2014 interest expense by approximately 19 million as of december 31 2012 the effective interest rates of approximately 15 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within 12 months 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our “fixedrate” tax exempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months in addition at december 31 2013 we had forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 175 million the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately 600 million at december 31 2013 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives which are discussed below we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended december 31 2013 alternatively we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues also increase or decrease 

during 2013 approximately 56 of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates and we currently expect that nearly 62 of our electricity revenues at our wastetoenergy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2014 our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased over the last few years as longterm power purchase agreements have expired the energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that the current market structure does not support medium and longterm electricity contracts as we renegotiate our powerpurchase agreements we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our wastetoenergy facilities will be based on variable market rates accordingly in recent years we implemented a more actively managed energy program which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity refer to notes 8 and 14 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives 

  

index to financial statements currency rate exposure — we have operations in canada as well as a cost center in india and investments in china the united kingdom and hong kong from time to time we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company refer to notes 8 and 14 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives the foreign currency exposure associated with these investments has not been material

we own or operate 269 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in our industry in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities is typically farther we manage 297 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy one method involves recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity our subsidiary wheelabrator technologies inc also uses waste to create energy by operating 22 highly efficient waste combustion plants that produce clean renewable energy we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic metal and electronics we provide costefficient environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada in addition to traditional waste operations we are also expanding to increase the service offerings we provide for our customers 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry the waste industry continues to undergo significant changes our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource landfill volumes have declined in recent years as customers are increasingly using alternatives to traditional disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the waste they generate accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  we believe that helping our customers achieve their environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth 

  

our company is dedicated to three transformational goals that we believe will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency we intend to pursue achievement of our longterm goals in the shortterm through efforts to 

 

  

  

  

 these efforts will be supported by ongoing improvements in information technologies we believe that execution of our strategy will provide longterm value to our stockholders in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and our board of directors has given management authority to make common stock repurchases in december 2012 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0355 to 0365 per share for dividends declared in 2013 which is a 28 increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2012 this will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the tenth consecutive year and is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors 

operations 

general 

through the third quarter of 2012 the operations of our local subsidiaries were primarily organized under our eastern midwest southern western and wheelabrator operating groups in july 2012 we announced a reorganization of our operations designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure while not disrupting our frontline operations principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic groups each of which previously constituted a reportable segment and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic areas from 22 to 17 

following our reorganization our senior management now evaluates oversees and manages the financial performance of our local solid waste business subsidiaries through these 17 areas see notes 12 and 21 to the consolidated financials statements for additional information related to this reorganization and our reportable segments respectively our wheelabrator business manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste or wheelabrator businesses as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

  

the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by our solid waste and wheelabrator businesses in the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 more information about our results of operations is included in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

 the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer operation of wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and resource recovery and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

 

 collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

 landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2012 we owned or operated 264 solid waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of 

  

water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and as a result thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

we also operate five secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer at december 31 2012 we owned or operated 297 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites at december 31 2012 our medical waste services business discussed below also had 13 smaller transfer operations separate from its 10 processing facilities but some of which are located at other existing company facilities that are permitted to consolidate regulated medical waste collections for disposal 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

wheelabrator as of december 31 2012 we owned or operated 17 wastetoenergy facilities and five independent power production plants or ipps which are located in the northeast in the midatlantic and in florida california and washington 

  

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam as of december 31 2012 our wastetoenergy facilities were capable of processing up to 22300 tons of solid waste each day in 2012 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 8 million tons of solid waste or approximately 21700 tons per day 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

we generate steam at our wastetoenergy and ipps facilities for the production of electricity we sell the electricity produced at our facilities into wholesale markets which include investorowned utilities power marketers and regional power pools some of our facilities also sell steam directly to end users fees charged for electricity and steam at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps have generally been subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market conditions such as inflation electricity prices and other general market factors during 2012 and 2010 several of our longterm energy contracts and shortterm pricing arrangements expired significantly increasing our wastetoenergy revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in market prices for electricity which generally correlate with fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets in which we operate our marketprice volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire we use “receive fixed pay variable” electricity commodity swaps to mitigate the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity refer to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section of this report for additional information about the company’s current considerations related to the management of this market exposure 

we continue to look at opportunities to expand our wastetoenergy business in the first quarter of 2012 we formed a uk joint venture together with a commercial waste management company to develop construct operate and maintain a wastetoenergy and recycling facility in england in connection with this investment we are committed to provide funding up to £57 million or 93 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2012 to be used for the development and construction of the facility additional information related to this investment is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements additionally in the second quarter of 2012 we invested in another uk joint venture together with an electric utility company to develop a wastetoenergy and recycling facility in england in connection with this investment we are committed to provide funding up to £156 million or 253 million based upon the exchange rates at december 31 2012 to be used for the development and construction of the facility 

in 2010 we made two investments which increased the total assets of our wheelabrator business by 318 million in the first quarter of 2010 we paid 142 million to acquire a 40 equity investment in shanghai environment group “seg” a subsidiary of shanghai chengtou holding co ltd as a joint venture partner in seg we participate in the operation and management of wastetoenergy and other waste services in the chinese market seg is also focused on building new wastetoenergy facilities in china as of december 31 2012 seg owned and operated three wastetoenergy facilities and five transfer stations an additional five wastetoenergy facilities are under construction our share of seg’s earnings are included in “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” in our consolidated statement of operations in the second quarter of 2010 we paid 150 million for the acquisition of a wastetoenergy facility in portsmouth virginia wheelabrator is actively pursuing additional development projects with industry partners and other opportunities to provide wastetoenergy services in europe and asia 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage in 2001 we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for 

  

commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing  — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing we operate 114 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale we also operate 12 secondary processing facilities where recyclable materials can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods materials processing services include data destruction and automated color sorting 

plastics materials recycling  — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

commodities recycling  — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of recyclable commodities being processed the volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the processed goods to our customers to whom we sell such materials the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods and on market conditions but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled fiber can significantly affect our revenues the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our operating income and margins 

other other services we provide include the following 

we provide recycling brokerage services which involves managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with little to no capital requirements we also provide electronics recycling we recycle discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials in recent years we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “takeback” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner 

our wm sustainability services organization offers our customers in all areas a variety of services in collaboration with our areas and strategic accounts program including i inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services ii specialized disposal services for oilfield drilling and operations and iii services associated with the disposal of fly ash residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an 

  

alternative to fossil fuel the epa endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2012 landfill gas beneficial use projects were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 137 of our solid waste landfills at 109 of these landfills the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 17 landfills the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at 10 landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers at one landfill the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel 

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts program works with customers whose locations span the united states our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs in 2011 we acquired oakleaf global holdings and its primary operations “oakleaf” which provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of thirdparty haulers oakleaf has increased our strategic accounts customer base and enhanced our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions 

we also offer integrated medical waste services for healthcare facilities pharmacies and individuals we provide fullservice solutions to facilities to assist them in best practices identifying waste streams and proper disposal 

we continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology part of our expansion of services includes offering portable selfstorage services fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program and a sharps mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose of their used syringes and lancets using our medwaste tracker ® system in addition we have made investments that involve the acquisition and development of interests in oil and gas producing properties finally we rent portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  we service such facilities and we provide street and parking lot sweeping services 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our solid waste business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

  

seasonal trends 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions including severe winter storms may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

employees 

at december 31 2012 we had approximately 43500 fulltime employees of which approximately 7500 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 8900 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for i obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits ii supporting variablerate taxexempt debt and iii estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills 

  

we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2012 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the closure postclosure and remedial obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established other than these permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability business interruption and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the perincident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2012 our commercial general liability insurance policy carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 25 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2012 our auto liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 5 million subject to additional deductibles of 48 million in the 5 million to 10 million layer we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2012 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage often referred to as “side b” the side a policy covers directors and officers directly for loss including defense costs when corporate indemnification is unavailable side aonly coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the company as the company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers 

regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us epa environment canada and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue 

because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the 

  

issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

   

the epa has issued source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years 

 

 we are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in united states federal statutes affecting our business 

 

  

   

 there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

in addition our landfill and wastetoenergy operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of regulations on our current and future operations 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of similar nature and generally include statements containing 

 

  

  

  

 you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2013 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources we have adopted a business strategy built on three key initiatives know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency in the shortterm we intend to pursue these initiatives through efforts to 

 

   

  

  

 there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends further we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

  

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation existing or future regulations andor enforcement actions may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

  

  

 regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities particularly demand from chinese paper mills can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively as we have experienced in 2012 or positively as we experienced in 2011 and 2010 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the decline in market prices in 2012 for commodities resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in revenue of 428 million compared with 2011 increases in the prices of recycling commodities 

  

resulted in yearoveryear increases in revenue of 216 million and 423 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively overall commodity prices increased yearoveryear 18 and 57 in 2011 and 2010 respectively and decreased yearoveryear 25 in 2012 these prices may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated 

there are also significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations that can significantly impact our revenue from yield provided by such businesses in most of the markets in which we operate electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 56 54 and 47 respectively of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates our wastetoenergy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into renewal contracts on comparable or favorable terms or at all to mitigate a portion of the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity we use “receive fixed pay variable” electricity swaps additionally revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations if we are unable to successfully negotiate longterm contracts or if market prices are at lower levels for sustained periods our revenues could be adversely affected 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or wastetoenergy facility large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as affecting the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services our landfills and our wastetoenergy facilities currently provide and have historically provided our highest operating margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results will decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is reasonably possible that our revenues and our operating margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or power production to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space and wastetoenergy facilities as a result our revenues and operating margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

  

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

   

we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

further we often enter into contractual arrangements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these arrangements is inherently subject to subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our operating margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties due to the downturn in the us economy and reduced tax revenue some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2012 we had 587 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and 475 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new 

  

facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns on average diesel fuel prices increased 3 and 29 for 2012 and 2011 respectively we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally we are currently party to pending litigation that pertains to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices and generally alleges that such charges were not properly disclosed were unfair and were contrary to customer service contracts see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs the increased operating costs will decrease our operating margins 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the 

  

future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we have participated in and contributed to various multiemployer pension plans administered by employer and union trustees in renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that participate in these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in various plans when we withdraw from plans we can incur withdrawal liabilities for those plans that have underfunded pension liabilities various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan the ongoing solvency of participating employers the investment returns obtained on plan assets and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation depending on such factors future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular reporting period we reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet 

we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 10 million in 2012 and 26 million in 2010 we are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for certain withdrawals which could be higher than the charges we have recognized 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

providing environmental and waste management services involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures and natural disasters which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials injury or death of employees and others or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages personal injury loss of life business interruption and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training and compliance programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations 

  

general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

in accordance with gaap we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit if we determine a development or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if we determine that events such as those described cause impairments any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses cause us to change our growth and development plans or fail to maintain our desired credit profile 

recent economic conditions have reduced our cash flows from operations and could do so in the future if impacts on our cash flows from operations are significant we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy or dividend declarations and we may delay reinstituting share repurchases from when we otherwise would we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities and there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable or that we would maintain our targeted balance of debt to equity we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile as well as a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 15 billion of debt as of december 31 2012 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next twelve months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds our interest rate swap agreements and borrowings outstanding under our canadian credit facility if interest rates increase our interest expense would also increase lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow 

we may use our 20 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available until its maturity in may 2016 as of december 31 2012 we had 400 million of borrowings and 933 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 667 million in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

  

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

our landfill operations emit methane identified as ghg efforts to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change could advance on the federal regional or state level and should comprehensive climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule which expanded the epa’s federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required the current requirements of these rules have not significantly impacted our operations or cash flows due to the current tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation however if certain changes to these regulations are enacted such as the lowering of thresholds or inclusion of biogenic emissions such amendments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

the seasonal nature of our business and “onetime” special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern us can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins 

certain weather conditions including severe weather storms may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

the construction of new international wastetoenergy facilities is subject to many business risks and uncertainties that could cause such projects to fail to achieve the financial results anticipated 

our wheelabrator business in investing in growing its wastetoenergy business in china and europe through projects to develop construct andor operate new facilities development and construction of a wastetoenergy facility is a complex capital intensive longterm process subject to risks of delays cost overruns and 

  

financing difficulty additionally technology incorporated in such facilities may not perform as anticipated any of these risks among others may cause such projects to fail to achieve the financial results anticipated which could have a negative impact on our operating results 

additionally the financing development construction and operation of projects outside the united states can entail significant political and financial risks which vary by country including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the legal and financial environment in foreign countries could also make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights under agreements any or all of the risks identified above with respect to our international projects could adversely affect our revenue and cash generation 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

overview 

our company is dedicated to three transformational goals that we believe will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency our strategy supports diversion from landfills and converting waste into valuable products as customers seek more economically and environmentally sound alternatives we intend to pursue achievement of our longterm goals in the shortterm through efforts to 

 

  

  

  

 these efforts will be supported by ongoing improvements in information technologies we believe that execution of our strategy will provide longterm value to our stockholders 

highlights of our financial results for 2012 include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the following explanation of certain notable items that impacted the comparability of our 2012 results with 2011 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2012 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

  

 the following explanation of certain notable items that impacted the comparability of our 2011 results with 2010 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2011 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our 2010 results were affected by the following 

 

   

  

  

 during 2012 we continued to produce strong cash flows from operating activities and return cash to our shareholders through dividends despite very challenging commodity market conditions our fourth quarter 2012 results were in line with our expectations and our internal revenue growth from yield was at its highest level for the year positioning the company to focus on growing earnings in 2013 we expect to see increased internal revenue growth from yield and volume as well as continued benefit from our cost savings programs including our 2012 restructuring we will also continue to emphasize strong cash flow to support our dividend debt reduction share repurchases and appropriate acquisition and investment opportunities 

free cash flow 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity nonetheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below in millions and may not be calculated the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 

 

  

 when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 to the comparable period in 2011 the decrease was primarily related to the impact of lower cash earnings an increase in tax payments of 63 million yearoveryear the payment of 59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in september 2012 and unfavorable impacts of working capital changes the decrease was partially offset by a favorable cash receipt of 72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in april 2012 

  

when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 to the comparable period in 2010 the change is primarily attributable to decreases in our income tax payments which positively affected our cash flow from operations as well as a cash payment of 37 million made when our canadian hedges matured in december 2010 this increase was partially offset by a favorable cash benefit of 77 million resulting from a litigation settlement in april 2010 and a 65 million federal tax refund in the third quarter of 2010 related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009 

the increase in capital expenditures is a result of our increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles related fueling infrastructure and growth initiatives and the impact of timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending we generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital spending in the fourth quarter of each year a more significant portion of our fourth quarter 2011 and 2010 spending was paid in cash in 2012 and 2011 respectively than in the preceding year

on july 28 2011 we paid 432 million net of cash received of 4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments to acquire oakleaf oakleaf provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of thirdparty haulers the operations we acquired generated approximately 580 million in revenues in 2010 we acquired oakleaf to advance our growth and transformation strategies and increase our national accounts customer base while enhancing our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions for the year ended december 31 2011 we incurred 1 million of acquisitionrelated costs which were classified as “selling general and administrative” expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 subsequent to the acquisition date oakleaf recognized revenues of 265 million and net income of less than 1 million which are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 oakleaf recognized revenues of 617 million and net losses of 29 million which are included in the consolidated statement of operations 

the following table shows adjustments since september 30 2011 to the allocation of the purchase price of oakleaf to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value this allocation was finalized as of september 30 2012 in millions 

 

  

the following table presents the final allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets amounts in millions except for amortization periods 

 

   

goodwill of 328 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized goodwill is a result of expected synergies from combining the company’s operations with oakleaf’s national accounts customer base and vendor network the vendorhauler network expands our partnership with thirdparty service providers in many cases we can provide vendorhaulers with opportunities to maintain and increase their business by utilizing our extensive postcollection network we believe this will generate significant benefits for the company and for the vendorhaulers goodwill has been assigned to our areas as they are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes 

the following pro forma consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition of oakleaf occurred at january 1 2010 in millions except per share amounts 

 

 subsequent event 

in january 2013 we acquired greenstar llc an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities we paid cash consideration of 170 million subject to postclosing adjustments pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement up to an additional 40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018 should greenstar llc satisfy certain performance criteria over this period 

basis of presentation of consolidated financial information 

indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing  — in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended authoritative guidance associated with indefinitelived intangible assets testing the amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is not required to take further action the amendments are effective for indefinitelived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 however early adoption was permitted the company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements additional information on impairment testing can be found in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income  — in june 2011 the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income which requires companies to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity in december 2011 the fasb deferred the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income were effective for the company on january 1 2012 and have been applied retrospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

fair value measurement  — in may 2011 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements this amended guidance defines certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with gaap the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements were effective for the company on january 1 

  

2012 and have been applied prospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

goodwill impairment testing  — in september 2011 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with goodwill impairment testing the amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the twostep impairment test if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary the amendments are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however early adoption was permitted the company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2011 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements additional information on impairment testing can be found in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  — in october 2009 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement are required to be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements became effective for the company on january 1 2011 the new accounting standard has been applied prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation of variable interest entities  — in june 2009 the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities the new guidance primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and is therefore required to consolidate the entity this new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that has i the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could be significant from the perspective of the entity the new guidance also requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events 

as a result of our implementation of this guidance effective january 1 2010 we deconsolidated certain final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation trusts because we share power over significant activities of these trusts with others our financial interests in these entities are discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements the deconsolidation of these trusts has not materially affected our financial position results of operations or cash flows during the periods presented 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs  — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs  — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs  — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace  — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace  — we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 32 landfill sites with expansions included at december 31 2012 10 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace six of these landfills required approval by our chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining four landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one or fiveyear requirements 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor or auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multi level review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

  

environmental remediation liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

  

  

 asset impairments 

our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our consolidated statement of operations estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as described below 

landfills  — the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill 

  

to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded at december 31 2012 three of our landfill sites in two jurisdictions for which we believe receipt of expansion permits is probable are not currently accepting waste the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for these three sites was 493 million at december 31 2012 we performed tests of recoverability for these landfills and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of these three sites 

goodwill — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess our goodwill for impairment 

in july 2012 we announced organizational changes including removing the management layer of our four geographic groups and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic areas through which we evaluate and oversee our solid waste business from 22 to 17 with the elimination of the geographic groups we have determined that our areas constitute reporting units and we now assess whether a goodwill impairment exists at the area level goodwill previously assigned to the groups was allocated to the areas on a relative fair value basis this reorganization did not change our other reporting units including the wheelabrator business and our other less material reporting units including recycling brokerage and waste diversion technology businesses 

we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we will not perform a quantitative assessment 

if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit the first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of the reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows we then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units 

in the second quarter of 2012 we believed an impairment indicator existed such that the fair value of our wheelabrator business could potentially be less than its carrying amount because of the negative effect on our revenues of the continued deterioration of electricity commodity prices coupled with our continued increased exposure to market prices as a result of the expiration of several longterm fixedrate electricity commodity 

  

contracts at our wastetoenergy and independent power facilities and the expiration of several longterm disposal contracts at abovemarket rates as a result we performed an interim impairment analysis of wheelabrator’s goodwill balance of 788 million we performed the interim quantitative assessment using both an income and a market approach in the second quarter of 2012 which indicated that the estimated fair value of our wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill balances using a measurement date of october 1 2012 this impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 compared to an excess of 30 at our annual fourth quarter 2011 test this quantitative assessment was performed using both an income and market approach similar to our interim quantitative assessment if market prices for electricity worsen or do not recover as we have projected our disposal volumes or rates decline our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts or our costs of capital increase the estimated fair value of our wheelabrator business could decrease and potentially result in an impairment charge in a future period we will continue to monitor our wheelabrator business 

our annual goodwill impairment test also indicated that the estimated fair value of our eastern canada area exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 this quantitative assessment also was performed using both an income and market approach the eastern canada area goodwill balance was 295 million at october 1 2012 if we do not achieve our anticipated disposal volumes our collection or disposal rates decline our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts costs of capital increase or we do not receive anticipated landfill expansions the estimated fair value of our eastern canada area could decrease and potentially result in an impairment charge in a future period we will continue to monitor our eastern canada area 

refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment considerations made during the reported periods 

indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill  — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 

beginning in 2012 when performing the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired if we believe an impairment has occurred we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value 

fair value is typically estimated using an income approach the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business 

fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to indefinitelived intangible assets impairment considerations made during the reported periods 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available 

  

evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer recycling and resource recovery and wastetoenergy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or mrf and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for fuel our wastetoenergy revenues which are generated by our wheelabrator business are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam our “other” lines of business include oakleaf our landfill gastoenergy operations portolet ® services portable selfstorage fluorescent lamp recycling and oil and gas producing properties intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements these operations are presented as “other” in the table below shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year 

 

   

the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  our revenues increased 271 million or 20 and 863 million or 69 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the yearoveryear change in revenues for both periods has been driven by i revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations ii acquisitions particularly the acquisition of oakleaf which increased yearoveryear consolidated revenues by 314 million for 2012 and 251 million for 2011 and iii market factors including fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices that negatively affected revenues in 2012 and favorably affected our revenues in 2011 volatility in diesel prices that affects the revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program foreign currency translation which negatively affected our revenues from our canadian operations in 2012 but favorably impacted our revenues in 2011 and lower electricity prices which correlate with natural gas prices and cause fluctuations in the rates we receive for electricity under our power purchase contracts and merchant transactions further affecting revenue changes were revenue increases due to higher volumes in 2012 but revenues declines due to lower volumes in 2011 

  

the following provides further details associated with our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer landfill and wastetoenergy disposal operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield during both years includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

in 2012 revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 86 million or 08 as compared with the prior year this revenue increase from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations however we also experienced yield growth from our disposal operations our commercial and industrial lines of business continue to drive our yield growth in our collection operations our 08 increase for 2012 is less than the 18 increase for 2011 this is due in large part to reduced increases of certain service fees and continued pressure from competition in our commercial line of business additionally we have experienced downward pressure on our revenue growth from yield in our residential line of business due to competition it has become increasingly difficult to retain customers and to win new contracts at current average rates as a result in many instances the company has offered increased services without a commensurate increase in pricing when bidding on or renewing residential contracts and pursuing residential subscription business these increased services are principally recycling services which are typically priced lower than our average rates this combination of increased competition and bundling of complementary services such as recycling in the residential line of business has put added pressure on our revenue growth from yield though we did see a steadily improving trend throughout 2012 

in both 2012 and 2011 our total collection and disposal revenue growth from yield was negatively affected by the expiration and renegotiation of a longterm disposal contract in august 2011 at one of our wastetoenergy facilities in south florida the expiration and renegotiation of this contract decreased revenues both in our wastetoenergy disposal line of business by approximately 17 million and 5 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and in our collection line of business by approximately 7 million and 2 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively certain of the franchise agreements serviced by our collection operations in south florida contain specific language that ties a portion of their total rate to the disposal rate charged by this wastetoenergy facility to our collection operations the expiration of this longterm contract in south florida negatively impacted our total collection and disposal yield by approximately 24 million and 7 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively additionally for 2012 we experienced further downward pressure on our revenue growth from yield of approximately 7 million resulting from the expiration and renegotiation of a second similar longterm wastetoenergy disposal contract in south florida at the end of march 2012 we expect this negative trend to continue into 2013 although the factors discussed above negatively affected our revenue growth from yield in 2012 as compared with 2011 we did see a favorable rate of revenue growth from yield in our landfill line of business during 2012 overall we have found that increasing our revenue growth from yield is currently a challenge given the increased service offerings in many of our new contracts and the highly competitive environment despite these headwinds we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in order to improve yield on our base business 

revenues from our environmental fee which are included in average yield on collection and disposal increased by 41 million and 47 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively environmental fee revenues totaled 344 million in 2012 as compared with 303 million in 2011 and 256 million in 2010 revenue increase from environmental fees flattened as we did not implement fee increases in 2012 commensurate with the prior year during 2013 we are not expecting our environmental fee to contribute significantly to our revenue growth 

recycling commodities  — decreases in the prices of the recycling commodities we sold resulted in a decrease in revenues of 428 million with an estimated negative impact on income from operations of approximately 130 million for 2012 our yearoveryear commodity prices declined almost 25 in 2012 driven 

  

by the continued increase in supply and lower demand in 2011 higher recycling commodity prices were the principal driver of our revenue increase of 216 million as compared with 2010 with an estimated favorable impact on income from operations of approximately 60 million in 2013 we expect recycling commodity sales prices to average levels present at the end of 2012 and be slightly negative in the first half of the year compared to 2012 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased by 33 million and 169 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively these increases are attributable to the fluctuation in the national average prices for diesel fuel that we use for our fuel surcharge program the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the passthrough of fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations which increased 11 million and 6 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

volume  — changes in our volume caused our revenue to increase 67 million or 05 for the year ended december 31 2012 this is a notable improvement from the prior year when revenue decline due to volume was 187 million or 15 for the year ended december 31 2011 

in 2012 our total landfill revenue increased 49 million over the comparable prior year period due to higher thirdparty volumes primarily driven by higher special waste volumes in the eastern and midwestern parts of the country in addition revenues increased from yearoveryear volume growth in our recycling brokerage business and our material recovery facilities by 61 million for 2012 the additional recycling capacity that we added during 2011 and 2012 as well as our continued pursuit of municipal volumes contributed to this increase in revenues due to volume 

volume declines from our collection business accounted for a 65 million revenue decline for the year ended december 31 2012 the decline was primarily driven by our commercial and to a lesser extent our residential collection lines of business which we attribute to the effects of pricing competition and diversion of waste by customers as well as the overall continued weakness in the economy revenue declines due to lower volumes in these two collection lines of business were offset in part by revenue increases in our industrial collection line of business driven in large part by the growth of our oilfield services business furthermore revenue increased due to volume growth in our nontraditional collection businesses as well as in our ancillary services primarily driven by increases in our medical waste services our inplant services and our portable selfstorage services businesses finally our 2012 volume growth was favorably impacted by the hurricane sandy cleanup efforts in the fourth quarter by about 26 million 

in 2011 volume declines from our collection business accounted for 327 million of volumerelated revenue decline we experienced commercial and residential collection revenue declines due to lower volume that we attributed to the overall weakness in the economy as well as the effects of pricing competition and diversion of waste by consumers our industrial collection operations were negatively affected by the economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the united states lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines generally attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition furthermore the overall yearoveryear comparison of volumes in the collection line of business was unfavorably impacted by our yearoveryear volume change of 94 million from the oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast in 2010 additionally in 2011 we experienced revenue declines at our wastetoenergy facilities primarily driven by the expiration of a longterm electric power capacity agreement which was offset to some extent by increases in waste tons processed and electricity produced 

revenue declines due to volume detailed above were offset in part by revenue increases of 101 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily from yearoveryear volume improvements in our recycling brokerage business and in our material recovery facilities our continued pursuit of municipal volumes as well as the addition of new single stream recycling facilities during 2011 contributed to these revenue increases due to volume we also experienced volumerelated revenue increases of 37 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from our strategic growth businesses and our landfill gastoenergy operations additionally our total landfill revenues increased 41 million in 2011 due to higher thirdparty volumes as compared with the prior 

  

year primarily driven by higher special waste volumes in the eastern and midwestern parts of the country however our landfill municipal solid waste volumes declined in 2011 as compared with the prior year due to economic conditions increased pricing competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers 

acquisitions — revenues increased 535 million and 449 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively due to acquisitions both in 2012 and 2011 the significant revenue increase due to acquisitions was principally associated with oakleaf included in our “other” business with the anniversary of the oakleaf acquisition in july 2012 we will not continue to experience the same yearoveryear revenue growth from this acquisition additionally in 2012 acquisitions increased our revenues in our collection line of business due in part to our oilfield services and recycling lines of business these acquisitions demonstrate our focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new complementary lines of business 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include auto liability workers’ compensation general liability and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent property taxes utilities and supplies 

our operating expenses increased 338 million or 40 when comparing 2012 with 2011 and increased 717 million or 92 when comparing 2011 with 2010 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 651 in 2012 638 in 2011 and 625 in 2010 the increases in our operating expenses during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 can largely be attributed to the following 

acquisitions and growth initiatives  — in both 2012 and 2011 we experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and our various growth and business development initiatives we estimate that these cost increases which affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below accounted for 109 and 42 of our 338 million and 717 million increases in operating expenses during 2012 and 2011 respectively recent acquisitions include oakleaf and a number of collection operations including oilfield services and several recycling operations in particular the acquisition of oakleaf increased operating costs by 263 million and 213 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively primarily impacting subcontractor costs and to a lesser extent cost of goods sold repair and maintenance and other categories the increase in operating expenses resulting from acquired businesses was more than offset by increased revenues from acquired businesses 

market prices for recyclable commodities — in both 2012 and 2011 volatile market prices for recyclable commodities was the main driver of the changes in cost of goods sold as presented in the table below primarily due to customer recycling rebates overall market prices for recycling commodities decreased by approximately 25 in 2012 and increased 20 in 2011 

volume changes — during 2012 we experienced an increase in variable costs attributable to higher volumes in certain lines of business particularly our recycling industrial collection and nontraditional collection businesses in our nontraditional collection businesses we experienced volume increases primarily in our inplant services additionally increased volumes related to hurricane sandy contributed to 

  

higher volumes in the latter part of 2012 during 2011 we experienced volume declines as a result of the ongoing weakness of the overall economic environment pricing competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers we continue to manage our fixed costs and control our variable costs as we experience volume increases and decreases these cost fluctuations due to volume have impacted each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 in addition to the significant items noted above other factors contributing to the changes in our operating expenses are discussed below 

labor and related benefits — the comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for the periods presented has been affected by costs incurred primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans these costs increased 2012 expense by 10 million and 2010 expense by 26 million 

the other contributing factors that increased costs in 2012 and 2011 were i higher hourly and salaried wages due to merit increases effective april 2011 and 2010 and ii increases stipulated in labor union agreements these costs were offset by lower incentive compensation in 2012 

maintenance and repairs  — the increase was primarily due to i increased fleet maintenance costs which include services provided by thirdparties tires parts and internal shop labor costs and ii differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our wastetoenergy facilities 

subcontractor costs — as noted above the increases in 2012 and 2011 in subcontractor costs was primarily a result of acquisitions principally the oakleaf acquisition other contributing factors include i our various growth and business development initiatives primarily associated with servicing our inplant services and healthcare solutions customers ii higher fuel prices as discussed below which resulted in an increase in the fuel component of our subcontractor costs and iii increased volumes related to hurricane sandy during 2012 the comparability to prior years was also affected by 54 million in costs related to oil spill clean up activities in 2010 

fuel — on average diesel fuel prices increased 3 and 29 for 2012 and 2011 respectively higher fuel costs resulted in increases in both our direct fuel costs and in the fuel component of our subcontractor costs as compared with the prior periods increased revenues attributable to our fuel surcharge largely offset the higher fuel costs our fuel surcharges covered approximately 95 of recoverable fuel costs in both 2012 and 2011 

  

landfill operating costs — the yearoveryear decreases in 2012 and 2011 were primarily attributable to the following 

 

  

  

  

 other  — the comparability of our other costs for the periods presented has been affected by i 2012 costs associated with a labor union dispute in the seattle area ii increased oil and gas development expense in 2012 and iii oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast in 2010 

selling general and administrative 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefit costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 79 million or 51 and increased 90 million or 62 when comparing 2012 with 2011 and 2011 with 2010 respectively our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 108 in 2012 116 in 2011 and 117 in 2010 

the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative costs during the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

 in addition in july 2012 we announced a reorganization of our operations designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure while not disrupting our frontline operations we have implemented the reorganization and for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 we realized labor and related benefits cost savings of 20 million 

  

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 other significant changes in our selling general and administrative expenses are discussed below 

 

  

  

  

 depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life using either a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

   

the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2012 and 2011 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of oakleaf and by our areas located in the northern us 

restructuring 

2012 restructurings — in july 2012 we announced a reorganization of operations designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure while not disrupting our frontline operations principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic groups each of which previously constituted a reportable segment and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic areas through which we evaluate and oversee our solid waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17 this reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the company including positions at both the management and support level voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many in management 

additionally in 2012 we recognized employee severance and benefits restructuring charges associated with the reorganization of oakleaf discussed below that began in 2011 along with certain other actions taken by the company in early 2012 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized a total of 67 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 56 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with these reorganizations the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized we do not expect additional charges related to the 2012 restructurings to be material 

2011 restructurings — beginning in july 2011 we took steps to streamline our organization as part of our cost savings programs this reorganization eliminated over 700 employee positions throughout the company including approximately 300 open positions additionally subsequent to our acquisition of oakleaf we incurred charges in connection with restructuring that organization during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized a total of 19 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 18 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

through december 31 2012 we have paid approximately 46 million of the employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of the combined 2012 and 2011 restructuring efforts 

income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 asset impairments — during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized impairment charges aggregating 83 million attributable in large part to 45 million of charges related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities we wrote down the carrying values of the facilities’ operating permits and property plant and equipment to their estimated fair values our medical waste services business is included in our “other” operations in note 21 we also recognized i 20 million of charges related to investments we had made in prior years in waste diversion technologies ii 6 million for the impairment of an oil  gas well due to projected operating losses iii 5 million for the impairment of a facility not currently used in our operations and iv 4 million of charges to impair goodwill related to certain of our operations to determine the appropriate charge for each of these items we estimated the fair value of the facilities or investments using anticipated future cash flows these charges are included in our “other” operations in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized impairment charges relating to two facilities in our medical waste services business in addition to the three facilities impaired in 2012 and discussed above as a result of the closure of one site and as a result of continuing operating losses at the other site we wrote down the net book values of the sites to their estimated fair values 

additionally we are in the process of evaluating opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of underperforming assets or assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives accordingly it is possible that additional impairments may be recorded as assets are sold or become heldforsale 

other — we filed a lawsuit in march 2008 related to the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009 in april 2010 we settled the lawsuit and received a onetime cash payment the settlement increased our “income from operations” for the year ended december 31 2010 by 77 million 

income from operations 

the following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 solid waste — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three year period ended december 31 2012 are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

other items affecting the reported periods include 

 

  

  

  

 2011 

 

  

 2010 

 

  

 significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended 2012 2011 and 2010 are summarized below 

wheelabrator — the significant decrease in income from operations of our wheelabrator business for the period ended december 31 2012 as compared to 2011 was largely driven by i lower revenues duee to the expiration of longterm contracts at certain of our wastetoenergy facilities ii lower energy pricing at our merchant facilities iii increased maintenance and repair costs primarily due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance activities and iv increased international development costs 

the decrease in 2011 income from operations as compared with 2010 was driven largely by i lower revenues due to the expiration of a longterm electric power capacity agreement that expired december 31 2010 and the expiration of other longterm contracts at our wastetoenergy and independent power facilities and ii costs incurred to refurbish a facility acquired in 2010 the impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by efforts to control costs across each of our facilities 

other — our “other” income from operations include i the effects of those elements of our inplant services landfill gastoenergy operations and thirdparty subcontract and administration revenues managed by our sustainability services organics healthcare renewable energy and strategic accounts organizations including oakleaf respectively that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments ii our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services and iii the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings such as portable selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling and in oil and gas producing properties in addition our “other” income from operations reflects the impacts of i nonoperating entities that provide financial assurance and selfinsurance support for the solid waste business and ii reclasses to prior year to include the costs of our former geographic group offices that prior to our 2012 restructuring were included in our operating segments 

significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

   

corporate and other  — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 interest expense 

our interest expense was 488 million in 2012 481 million in 2011 and 473 million in 2010 during the reported periods our interest expense has increased only slightly in spite of an increase in our debt balances this is primarily attributable to i a decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate that has been achieved by refinancing debt at maturity with debt at much lower fixed interest rates ii the impacts that lower market interest rates have had on the cost of certain of our taxexempt debt and iii an increase in capitalized interest due primarily to higher capital spending these decreases in interest expense have been partially offset by a decrease in the benefits provided by active and terminated interest rate swap agreements 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

we recognized “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of 46 million in 2012 31 million in 2011 and 21 million in 2010 these losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties and a refined coal facility as well as i noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and ii unconsolidated trusts for final capping closure postclosure or environmental obligations the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in lowincome housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in provision for income taxes refer to notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments additionally in 2012 we recognized a charge of 10 million related to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an unconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method 

other net 

we recognized other net expense of 18 million and 4 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively and other net income of 5 million in 2010 the increase in expense during 2012 was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of 16 million relating to an otherthantemporary decline in the value of an investment accounted for under the cost method we wrote down the carrying value of our investment to its fair value based on other thirdparty investors’ recent transactions in these securities which are considered to be the best evidence of fair value currently available 

  

provision for income taxes 

we recorded provisions for income taxes of 443 million in 2012 511 million in 2011 and 629 million in 2010 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 340 336 and 385 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes ii the realization of federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards iii changes in effective state and canadian statutory tax rates iv tax audit settlements and v the impact of federal lowincome housing and refined coal tax credits the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 on july 28 2011 we acquired oakleaf and its primary operations as a result of the acquisition we received income tax attributes primarily federal and state net operating losses and allocated a portion of the purchase price to these acquired assets at the time of the acquisition we fully recognized all of the tax attributes identified by the seller and concluded the realization of these attributes would not affect our overall provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2012 as a result of new information we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 8 million related to additional oakleaf federal net operating losses received in the acquisition as this time we do not anticipate the remaining tax attributes when realized will affect our overall provision for income taxes while these attributes are not expected to affect our provision for income taxes they will have a favorable impact on our cash taxes although we do not anticipate the impact to be material to our overall cash flow from operations 

we expect our 2013 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 350 based on expected income levels projected federal tax credits and other permanent items 

  

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2 2013 and includes an extension for one year of the 50 bonus depreciation allowance the provision specifically applies to qualifying property placed in service before january 1 2014 the acceleration of deductions on 2012 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provision had no impact on our 2012 effective tax rate however the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our 2012 cash taxes by approximately 90 million taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken 

noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 43 million in 2012 48 million in 2011 and 49 million in 2010 these amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator business refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the consolidation of these variable interest entities 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 264 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2012 and 266 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 and 2011 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2012 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 43 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 32 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

  

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2012 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

  

  

 the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 in millions 

 

  

  

  

   

the tons received at our landfills in 2012 and 2011 are shown below tons in thousands 

 

  

  

 when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2012 our closed sites management group managed 211 closed landfills 

landfill assets  — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2012 and 2011 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2012 in millions 

 

 as of december 31 2012 we estimate that we will spend approximately 500 million in 2013 and approximately 900 million in 2014 and 2015 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

  

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities  — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2012 and 2011 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2012 in millions 

 

 landfill costs and expenses  — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 the comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds with a term approximating the weightedaverage period until settlement of the underlying obligations additionally in 2010 we increased our cost estimates associated with environmental remediation obligations primarily based on a review and evaluation of existing remediation projects as these remediation projects progressed more defined plans were developed resulting in a net increase in remediation expense to reflect the more likely remedies in both 2012 and 2011 we had favorable revisions to environmental remediation liabilities at closed sites based on the estimated cost of the remediation alternatives prescribed by regulators 

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

   

 amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis 

 

 different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 269 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear the comparability of our total company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 has also been affected by i increased landfill development and environmental costs and ii the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations landfill amortization expense was reduced by 3 million in 2012 11 million in 2011 and 13 million in 2010 for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities ii effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction or iii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v final capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and vii capital expenditures acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and we have also returned value to shareholders through share repurchases 

  

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2012 and 2011 in millions 

 

 cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less our cash and cash equivalents have decreased as a result of the execution of our strategic growth plans which has increased our level of capital spending acquisitions and investments 

restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

debt  — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2012 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 were primarily attributable to i net debt borrowings of 122 million and ii the impacts of accounting for other noncash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps foreign currency translation interest accretion and capital leases 

as of december 31 2012 we had i 688 million of debt maturing within twelve months including 400 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility us75 million of advances outstanding under our canadian credit facility 161 million of taxexempt bonds and ii 475 million of taxexempt borrowings subject to repricing within the next twelve months based on our intent and ability to refinance a portion of this debt on a longterm basis as of december 31 2012 we have classified 420 million of this debt as longterm and the remaining 743 million as current obligations 

  

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit in millions at december 31 categorized by type of facility

 net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

 we paid an aggregate of 658 million in cash dividends during 2012 compared with 637 million in 2011 and 604 million in 2010 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 0315 in 2010 to 034 in 2011 and to 0355 in 2012 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding during 2010 and 2011 as a result of our share repurchase programs 

we paid 575 million for share repurchases in 2011 compared with 501 million in 2010 we repurchased approximately 17 million and 15 million shares of our common stock in 2011 and 2010 respectively we did not repurchase any shares during 2012 

in december 2012 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from 0355 to 0365 per share for dividends declared in 2013 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant additionally the board of directors authorized up to 500 million in share repurchases in 

  

connection with the 2013 financial plan any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations 

 

  

  

  

 during 2012 we did not have any significant noncash activities for the year ended december 31 2011 noncash activities included proceeds from taxexempt borrowings net of principal payments made directly from trust funds of 100 million during the year ended december 31 2010 we did not have any taxexempt bond financings however we did have a 215 million noncash increase in our debt obligations as a result of the issuance of a note payable in return for a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties this investment is discussed in detail in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   

summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

liquidity impacts of income tax items 

recent legislation  — the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2 2013 and included an extension for one year of the 50 bonus depreciation allowance the provision specifically applies to qualifying property placed in service before january 1 2014 the acceleration of deductions on capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions has no impact on our effective tax rate but reduces our cash taxes in the periods in which the deductions are taken 

the acceleration of depreciation deductions related to qualifying property additions in 2012 decreased our full year 2012 cash taxes by approximately 90 million and based on our current forecast of 2013 capital expenditures we estimate an additional reduction in our full year 2013 cash taxes of approximately 90 million related to qualifying property additions in 2013 however taking accelerated deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken on a net basis after taking into account the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs the deductions taken in previous years from acceleration programs more than offset the benefits received in 2012 and expected to be received in 2013 our full year tax payments were approximately 60 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 

uncertain tax positions  — we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are primarily included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet because the company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity we anticipate that approximately 14 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and 3 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed within the next twelve months the anticipated reversals are related to state tax items none of which are material and are expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period in addition there are federal items related to the tax implications of the book impairments discussed in note 13 that also are anticipated to reverse within the next 12 months 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2012 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of diesel fuel have affected our operating margins in recent years we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2012 over 20 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount as of december 31 2012 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 

  

interest rate exposure  — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs which are discussed in the financial assurance and insurance obligations section of item 1 

as of december 31 2012 we had 99 billion of longterm debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives discounts and premiums the effective interest rates of approximately 15 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2013 the most significant components of our variablerate debt obligations are i 587 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process ii 475 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within twelve months iii 400 million of borrowings outstanding under our 20 billion revolving credit facility and iv us75 million of outstanding advances under our canadian credit facility we currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2013 interest expense by approximately 13 million as of december 31 2011 the effective interest rates of approximately 22 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within twelve months 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our “fixedrate” tax exempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months in addition at december 31 2012 we had forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 175 million the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately 800 million at december 31 2012 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

commodity price exposure  — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives which are discussed below we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended december 31 2012 alternatively we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues also increase or decrease 

during 2012 approximately 56 of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates and we currently expect that nearly 56 of our electricity revenues at our wastetoenergy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2013 our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased over the last few years as longterm power purchase agreements have expired the energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that the current market structure does not support medium and longterm electricity contracts as we renegotiate our powerpurchase agreements we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our wastetoenergy facilities will be based on variable market rates accordingly in 2010 we implemented a more actively managed energy program which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives 

  

currency rate exposure  — we have operations in canada and investments in china and the united kingdom from time to time we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives the foreign currency exposure associated with our investments in china and the united kingdom has not been material

we are the leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in north america our subsidiaries provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we are also a leading developer operator and owner of wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states our customers include residential commercial industrial and municipal customers throughout north america during 2011 our largest customer represented approximately 1 of annual revenues we employed approximately 44300 people as of december 31 2011 

through our core waste management services we own or operate 271 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in our industry in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities is typically farther we manage 287 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy one method we use involves recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills for use in the generation of electricity we also use waste to create energy through a highly efficient combustion process our wastetoenergy subsidiary wheelabrator technologies inc operates 22 plants that produce clean renewable energy we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic metal and electronics through our recycling operations we provide costefficient environmentally sound programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada in addition to traditional waste operations we are also expanding to increase the service offerings we provide for our customers 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry the waste industry continues to confront significant changes our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource landfill volumes have declined in recent years as customers are increasingly using alternatives to traditional disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the waste they generate accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  we believe that helping our customers achieve their environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth 

  

our company is dedicated to three transformational goals that we believe will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency we intend to pursue achievement of our longterm goals in the shortterm through efforts to

operations 

general 

we manage and evaluate our principal operations through five groups our four geographic operating groups comprised of our eastern midwest southern and western groups provide collection transfer disposal in both solid waste and hazardous waste landfills and recycling services our fifth group is the wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants or ipps we also provide additional services that are not managed through our five groups as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our groups or reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2011 more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

   

the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

 

 collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

 landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2011 we owned or operated 266 solid waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and as a result thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

  

we also operate five secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

transfer at december 31 2011 we owned or operated 287 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites at december 31 2011 our wm healthcare solutions subsidiary discussed below also had 21 smaller transfer operations separate from its ten processing facilities but some of which are located at other existing company facilities that are permitted to consolidate regulated medical waste collections for disposal 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

wheelabrator as of december 31 2011 we owned or operated 17 wastetoenergy facilities and five independent power production plants or ipps which are located in the northeast in the midatlantic and in florida california and washington 

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam as of december 31 2011 our wastetoenergy facilities were capable of processing up to 22300 tons of solid waste each day in 2011 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 8 million tons of solid waste or approximately 22000 tons per day 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

we generate steam at our wastetoenergy and ipps facilities for the production of electricity we sell the electricity produced at our facilities into wholesale markets which include investorowned utilities power marketers and regional power pools some of our facilities also sell steam directly to end users fees charged for electricity and steam at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps have generally been subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market 

  

conditions such as inflation electricity prices and other general market factors during 2010 and 2009 several of our longterm energy contracts and shortterm pricing arrangements expired significantly increasing our wastetoenergy revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in market prices for electricity which generally correlate with fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets in which we operate our marketprice volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire the next longterm contract will expire in march 2012 we use shortterm “receive fixed pay variable” electricity commodity swaps to mitigate the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity refer to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section of this report for additional information about the company’s current considerations related to the management of this market exposure 

we continue to look at opportunities to expand our wastetoenergy business in 2010 we made two investments which increased the total assets of our wheelabrator group by 318 million in the first quarter of 2010 we paid 142 million to acquire a 40 equity investment in shanghai environment group “seg” a subsidiary of shanghai chengtou holding co ltd as a joint venture partner in seg we will participate in the operation and management of wastetoenergy and other waste services in the chinese market seg will also focus on building new wastetoenergy facilities in china as of december 31 2011 seg owned and operated two wastetoenergy facilities five landfills and five transfer stations an additional five wastetoenergy facilities were under construction our share of seg’s earnings are included in “equity in net losses in unconsolidated entities” in our consolidated statement of operations in the second quarter of 2010 we paid 150 million for the acquisition of a wastetoenergy facility in portsmouth virginia additionally wheelabrator is actively pursuing development projects with industry partners and pursuing other opportunities to provide wastetoenergy services in the united kingdom 

recycling our recycling operations provide communities and industries with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage in 2001 we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

materials processing  — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing we operate 107 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale we also operate 13 secondary processing facilities where recyclable materials can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods materials processing services include data destruction and automated color sorting 

plastics materials recycling  — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

commodities recycling  — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of recyclable commodities being processed the volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the processed goods to our customers to whom we sell such materials the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of 

  

processed goods and on market conditions but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled fiber can significantly affect our revenues the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our operating income and margins 

other other services not managed within our groups include the following 

we provide recycling brokerage services which involves managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with little to no capital requirements we also provide electronics recycling we recycle discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials in recent years we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “takeback” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner 

wm sustainability services provides a variety of sustainability services to businesses and organizations this includes inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our wm renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the epa endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2011 landfill gas beneficial use projects were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 131 of our solid waste landfills at 102 of these landfills the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 18 landfills the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at ten landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers at one landfill the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel 

although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts program works with customers whose locations span the united states our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs on july 28 2011 we acquired oakleaf global holdings and its primary operations “oakleaf” which provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of thirdparty haulers oakleaf has increased our national accounts customer base and enhanced our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions 

our wm healthcare solutions subsidiary offers integrated medical waste services for healthcare facilities pharmacies and individuals we provide fullservice solutions to facilities to assist them in best practices identifying waste streams and proper disposal 

we also have begun investing in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology part of our expansion of services includes offering portable selfstorage services fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program and a sharps mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose of 

  

their used syringes and lancets using our medwaste tracker ® system in addition we have made investments that involve acquisition and development of interests in oil and gas producing properties finally we rent portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  we service such facilities and we provide street and parking lot sweeping services 

competition 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other byproducts we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on service offerings as companies individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste

our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the traditional seasonal increase in the volume of construction and demolition waste historically the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions in which we operate have tended to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 

additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our southern group can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions including severe winter storms may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we had approximately 44300 fulltime employees of which approximately 8300 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 9200 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

financial assurance 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits various forms of financial assurance are also required to support variablerate taxexempt debt and by regulatory agencies for estimated final capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills 

  

we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2011 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

insurance 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2011 our general liability insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 25 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2011 our auto liability insurance program included a per incident base deductible of 5 million subject to additional deductibles of 48 million in the 5 million to 10 million layer we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2011 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage often referred to as “side b” the side a policy covers directors and officers directly for loss including defense costs when corporate indemnification is unavailable side aonly coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the company as the company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers 

regulation 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us epa environment canada and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue 

because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

  

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

 the epa has issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years 

  

 we are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in united states federal statutes affecting our business 

 

  

 there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 

in addition our landfill and wastetoenergy operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at 

  

landfills or wastetoenergy facilities legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretation of flow control legislation or the supreme court decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of regulations on our current and future operations 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of similar nature and generally include statements containing 

 

  

  

  

 you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2012 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forwardlooking statements made by the company 

  

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by products we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities when this happens we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources we have adopted a business strategy built on three key initiatives know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency in the shortterm we intend to pursue these initiatives through efforts to 

 

  

  

  

 there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends further we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation existing or future regulations andor enforcement actions may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters in recent years we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry we expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue among other things governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

  

  

 regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

  

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretation of flow control legislation or the supreme court decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities particularly demand from chinese paper mills can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively as we experienced in 2009 or positively as we experienced in 2010 and 2011 as we have increased the size of our recycling operations we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the decline in market prices in 2009 for commodities resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in revenue of 447 million compared with 2008 increases in the prices of recycling commodities resulted in yearoveryear increases in revenue of 423 million and 216 million in 2010 and 2011 respectively market prices for recyclable commodities have increased significantly from the nearhistoric lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 overall commodity prices have increased yearoveryear approximately 57 and 18 in 2010 and 2011 respectively despite the recent positive trend in commodity prices these prices may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are eliminated 

there are also significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations that can significantly impact our revenue from yield provided by such businesses in most of the markets in which we operate electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 54 47 and 46 respectively of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates our wastetoenergy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into renewal contracts on comparable or favorable terms or at all to mitigate a portion of the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity we use “receive fixed pay variable” electricity swaps these swaps are generally shortterm in nature additionally revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations if we are unable to successfully negotiate longterm contracts or if market prices are at lower levels for sustained periods our revenues could be adversely affected 

increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or wastetoenergy facility large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as affecting the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal 

  

and wastetoenergy services our landfills and our wastetoenergy facilities currently provide and have historically provided our highest operating margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results will decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is reasonably possible that our revenues and our operating margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities and our profitability 

our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource research and development activities are ongoing to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable byproducts we and many other companies are investing in these technologies it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or power production to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space and wastetoenergy facilities as a result our revenues and operating margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives 

if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in develop or license and protect new technologies research and development of new technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of 

  

particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

 we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

further we often enter into contractual arrangements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these arrangements is inherently subject to subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our operating margins 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers and our ability to implement our pricing strategy economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index and our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties due to the downturn in the us economy and reduced tax revenue some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates 

many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties including bankruptcy in some cases purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates particularly large national accounts could negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2011 we had 611 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and 305 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

  

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites permits to build operate and expand solid waste management facilities including landfills and transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we have seen average quarterly fuel prices increase by as much as 33 on a yearoveryear basis and decrease by as much as 47 on a yearoveryear basis within the last three years we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally we are currently party to a pending litigation that pertains to our fuel and environmental charge and generally alleges that such charges were not properly disclosed were unfair and were contrary to contract see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs the increased operating costs will decrease our operating margins 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its 

  

information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

we have participated in and contributed to various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by employer and union trustees in renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that participate in these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in various plans when we withdraw from plans we can incur withdrawal liabilities for those plans that have underfunded pension liabilities various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan the ongoing solvency of participating employers the investment returns obtained on plan assets and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation we reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet 

we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 26 million in 2010 and 9 million in 2009 we are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for these previous withdrawals which could be materially higher than the charges we have recognized 

our business is subject to operational and safety risks including the risk of personal injury to employees and others 

provision of environmental and waste management services involves risks such as truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures and natural disasters which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials injury or death of employees and others or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages personal injury loss of life business interruption and property damage or destruction 

while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training and compliance programs as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit if we determine a development or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if we determine that events such as those described cause impairments any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses or cause us to change our growth and development plans or fail to maintain our desired credit profile 

recent economic conditions have reduced our cash flows from operations and could do so in the future if impacts on our cash flows from operations are significant we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth and acquisition activity implementation of our business strategy dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities and there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable or that we would maintain our targeted balance of debt to equity we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is 

  

contingent upon our credit profile as well as a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

additionally we have 22 billion of debt as of december 31 2011 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next twelve months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds our interest rate swap agreements and borrowings outstanding under our canadian credit facility therefore increases in interest rates can increase our interest expenses which also would lower our net income and decrease our cash flow 

we may use our fiveyear 20 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2011 we had 150 million of borrowings and 1012 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 838 million in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

efforts to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change continue to advance on the federal regional and state level our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg in the 111th congress the us house of representatives passed a bill that would regulate ghgs comprehensively while the centerpiece of that bill would be a ghg emission allowance capandtrade system neither landfills nor qualifying wastetoenergy plants would be compelled to hold allowances for their ghg emissions rather they would be subject to certain further emission controls to be determined through administrative rulemaking should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control ghg emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule “psd tailoring rule” the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required under the psd and title v programs the epa’s legal authority to “tailor” statutory thresholds in this rule has been challenged and the epa has delayed regulation of certain emissions pending further regulatory analysis we cannot predict the final requirements of stationary source rules that might apply to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities as a result of this rulemaking and accordingly further developments in this area could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

the seasonal nature of our business and “onetime” special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our southern group can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins during 2010 our financial results included revenue generated as a result of cleanup efforts in connection with the oil spill along the gulf coast and the substantial flooding in tennessee however these special projects have a limited time span 

certain weather conditions including severe weather storms may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

  

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results 

we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses or third parties with whom we have a relationship were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 

some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent it is our policy to comply with all applicable antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business additionally violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2011 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

our company is dedicated to three transformational goals that we believe will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency our strategy supports diversion from landfills and converting waste into valuable products as customers seek more economically and environmentally sound alternatives we intend to pursue achievement of our longterm goals in the shortterm through efforts to 

 

  

  

  

 these efforts will be supported by ongoing improvements in information technologies we believe that execution of our strategy will provide longterm value to our stockholders 

our 2011 results of operations reflect the impact of improved recyclable commodity prices and recycling volumes our discipline in pricing and our continued investment in our strategic initiatives including our july 28 2011 acquisition of the primary operations of oakleaf global holdings “oakleaf” highlights of our financial results for 2011 include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 the following explanation of certain notable items that impacted the comparability of our 2011 results with 2010 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance our 2011 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our 2010 results were affected by the following 

 

  

  

  

   

we finished 2011 on a positive note with strong fourth quarter results that we intend to build upon going into 2012 our employees are focused on continuing the progress that we have made on our strategic growth initiatives and cost savings programs in 2012 we expect to continue to accomplish our goals of growing our revenue expanding our operating margins increasing our return on invested capital and returning cash to our shareholders 

free cash flow  — as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable us gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors greater insight into how we view our liquidity nonetheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below in millions and may not be the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 

 

  

 

 when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 to the comparable period in 2010 the change is primarily attributable to decreases in our income tax payments which have positively affected our cash flow from operations this year as well as a cash payment of 37 million made when our canadian hedges matured in december 2010 this current year increase was partially offset by a favorable cash benefit of 77 million resulting from a litigation settlement in april 2010 and a 65 million federal tax refund in the third quarter of 2010 related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009 

the increase in capital expenditures is a result of our increased spending on natural gas vehicles and fueling infrastructure information technology infrastructure and growth initiatives as well as our taking advantage of bonus depreciation the yearoveryear increase in capital expenditures was also affected by timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending we generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital spending in the fourth quarter of each year a more significant portion of our fourth quarter 2010 spending was paid in cash in 2011 than in the preceding year 

our ability to generate 12 billion in free cash flow in 2011 enabled us to return 12 billion in cash to stockholders during the year through the payment of 637 million in dividends and the repurchase of 575 million of our common stock 

  

acquisition of oakleaf global holdings  — on july 28 2011 we paid 432 million net of cash received of 4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments to acquire oakleaf oakleaf provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of thirdparty haulers the operations we acquired generated approximately 580 million in revenues in 2010 we acquired oakleaf to advance our growth and transformation strategies and increase our national accounts customer base while enhancing our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions for the year ended december 31 2011 we incurred 1 million of acquisitionrelated costs which are classified as “selling general and administrative” expenses since the acquisition date oakleaf has recognized revenues of 265 million and net income of less than 1 million which are included in our consolidated statement of operations 

the following table shows adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price of oakleaf to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value from september 30 2011 to december 31 2011 in millions 

 

  

 

 the following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets amounts in millions except for amortization periods 

 

 goodwill of 327 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized goodwill is a result of expected synergies from combining the company’s operations with oakleaf’s national accounts customer base and vendor network the vendorhauler network expands our partnership with thirdparty service providers in many cases we can provide vendorhaulers with opportunities to maintain and increase their business by utilizing our extensive postcollection network we believe this will generate significant benefits for the company and for the vendorhaulers goodwill acquired has been allocated to our four geographic groups based on our preliminary valuations goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes 

  

the following pro forma consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition of oakleaf occurred at january 1 2010 in millions except per share amounts 

 

 basis of presentation of consolidated financial information 

goodwill impairment testing  — in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended authoritative guidance associated with goodwill impairment testing the amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the twostep impairment test if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary the amendments are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however early adoption was permitted the company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2011 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements additional information on impairment testing can be found in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  — in october 2009 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement are required to be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements became effective for the company on january 1 2011 the new accounting standard has been applied prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation of variable interest entities  — in june 2009 the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities the new guidance primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and is therefore required to consolidate the entity this new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that has i the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could be significant from the perspective of the entity the new guidance also requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events 

as a result of our implementation of this guidance effective january 1 2010 we deconsolidated certain final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation trusts because we share power over significant activities of these trusts with others our financial interests in these entities are discussed in note 20 the deconsolidation of these trusts has not materially affected our financial position results of operations or cash flows during the periods presented 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methods in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for 

  

landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

landfills 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

landfill costs  — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

final capping costs  — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific final capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs  — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

remaining permitted airspace  — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

expansion airspace  — we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of our principal financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 33 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2011 11 landfills required the principal financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace seven of these landfills required approval by our principal financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining four landfills required approval primarily due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one or fiveyear requirements 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor or auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multi level review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most 

  

significantly if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

environmental remediation liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

  

  

 asset impairments 

our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances including management decisions pertaining to such assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our consolidated statement of operations estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

  

there are other considerations for impairments of landfills goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as described below 

landfills  — the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved during the review of a landfill expansion application a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste prior to receipt of the expansion permit however such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because after consideration of all facts such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit as a result our tests of recoverability which generally make use of a probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded at december 31 2011 three of our landfill sites in two jurisdictions in the company’s midwest group for which we believe receipt of expansion permits is probable had ceased accepting waste the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for these three sites was 469 million at december 31 2011 we performed tests of recoverability for these landfills and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probabilityweighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of these three sites 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  — at least annually and more frequently if warranted we assess our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we will not perform a quantitative assessment 

if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit the first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment fair value is typically estimated using an income approach or a combination of the income approach and market approach when applicable the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of our reporting units we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon our reporting units’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows we then apply that multiple to our reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 

fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units 

we assess whether other indefinitelived intangible asset impairments exist by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value fair value is typically estimated using an income approach for the respective asset as described above if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value an impairment would be recognized in the amount of the excess 

  

refer to note 6 to the consolidating financial statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment considerations made during the reported periods 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 

insured and selfinsured claims 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

results of operations 

operating revenues 

we currently manage and evaluate our principal operations through five groups our four geographic groups which are comprised of our eastern midwest southern and western groups provide collection transfer disposal in both solid waste and hazardous waste landfills and recycling services our fifth group is the wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants these five groups are our reportable segments 

we also provide additional services that are not managed through our five groups including the oakleaf operations we acquired on july 28 2011 recycling brokerage services electronic recycling services inplant services landfill gastoenergy services integrated medical waste services and the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings and solutions part of our expansion of services includes offering portable selfstorage services and fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program in addition we have made investments that involve the acquisition and development of interests in oil and gas producing properties these operations are presented as “other” in the table below shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our five groups and our other services 

 

   

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer recycling and wastetoenergy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility or mrf and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for fuel our wastetoenergy revenues which are generated by our wheelabrator group are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam our “other” lines of business includes oakleaf our landfill gastoenergy operations portolet ® services portable selfstorage fluorescent lamp recycling and oil and gas producing properties intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

  

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our revenues increased 863 million or 69 and 724 million or 61 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the yearoveryear change in revenues for both periods has been driven by i market factors including higher recyclable commodity prices higher diesel fuel prices which increase revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program and foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our canadian operations ii acquisitions particularly the acquisition of oakleaf which increased consolidated revenues by 251 million for 2011 and iii revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations offsetting these revenue increases were revenue declines due to lower volumes 

the following provides further details associated with our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

average yield 

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer landfill and wastetoenergy disposal operations exclusive of volume 

  

changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield during both years includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

in both 2011 and 2010 our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield demonstrates our commitment to our pricing strategies this increase in revenue from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations which experienced yield growth in all lines of business and in every geographic group as discussed below increased collection revenues due to average yield have been more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes however revenue growth from yield on base business and our efforts toward controlling variable costs continue to favorably influence margin changes in our collection line of business 

in 2011 revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was 193 million or 18 as compared with the prior year this revenue increase from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations however we also experienced yield growth from our disposal operations our 18 increase for 2011 is less than the 23 increase for 2010 this is due in large part to our residential line of business in which we have experienced downward pressure on our revenue growth from yield across most of our geographic groups most notably in our eastern and southern groups due to competition it has become increasingly difficult to retain customers and to win new contracts at current average rates as a result in many instances the company has offered increased services principally recycling services when bidding on or renewing residential contracts and pursuing residential subscription business additional recycling services are typically at lower ratesthis combination of increased competition and bundling of complementary services such as recycling in the residential line of business has put added pressure on our revenue growth from yield 

our total collection and disposal revenue growth from yield has also been negatively affected during 2011 by factors including the changes in the mix of our temporary and permanent customers in our industrial business particularly in north and south florida additionally we saw a 5 million yield decline in our wastetoenergy facilities primarily driven by the expiration of a longterm contract at one of our wastetoenergy operations in south florida in august 2011 we expect this negative trend to continue into 2012 due to the expiration of a similar longterm contract that will occur at the end of march 2012 although these factors discussed above negatively affected our revenue growth from yield in 2011 as compared with 2010 we did see a favorable rate of revenue growth from yield in our commercial line of business during 2011 as compared with the prior year this favorable impact was driven by both price increases and additional service fees overall we have found that increasing our revenue growth from yield in today’s market is a challenge given the reduced volume levels resulting from the economic slowdown the increased service offerings in many of our new contracts and the highly competitive environment despite these headwinds we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in order to improve yield on our base business 

revenues from our environmental fee which are included in average yield on collection and disposal increased by 37 million and 33 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively environmental fee revenues totaled 288 million in 2011 as compared with 251 million in 2010 and 218 million in 2009 

recycling commodities  — increases in the prices of the recycling commodities we sold resulted in an increase in revenues of 216 million in 2011 as compared with 2010 for the first nine months of 2011 our overall commodity prices increased approximately 26 as compared with the first nine months of the prior year however during the fourth quarter of 2011 we saw a decline of approximately 8 in commodity prices due to increased supply and lower demand 

in 2010 higher recycling commodity prices were the principal driver of our revenue increase of 423 million as compared with 2009 market prices for recyclable commodities increased significantly from the nearhistoric lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 for the twelve months of 2010 overall commodity prices increased approximately 57 as compared with 2009 

  

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — these revenues which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased by 169 million and 69 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively this increase is directly attributable to higher national average prices for diesel fuel that we use for our fuel surcharge program the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the passthrough of fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above 

volume  — our revenue decline due to volume was 187 million or 15 for the year ended december 31 2011 this is a notable improvement in the rate of revenue decline from the prior year when revenue decline due to volume was 304 million or 26 volume declines are generally attributable to economic conditions increased pricing competition and increasing focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers additionally the oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast in 2010 unfavorably impacted our yearoveryear volume change by 94 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

in 2011 volume declines from our collection business accounted for 327 million of volumerelated revenue decline we experienced commercial and residential collection revenue declines due to lower volume that we attribute to the overall weakness in the economy as well as the effects of pricing competition and diversion of waste by consumers our industrial collection operations continued to be negatively affected by the current economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the united states lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines in the current year and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition furthermore as noted above the overall yearoveryear comparison of volumes in the collection line of business was unfavorably impacted by volume we received from the oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast in 2010 additionally in 2011 we experienced revenue declines at our wastetoenergy facilities primarily driven by the expiration of a longterm electric power capacity agreement which was offset to some extent by increases in waste tons processed and electricity produced 

revenue declines due to volume detailed above were offset in part by revenue increases of 101 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily from yearoveryear volume improvements in our recycling brokerage business and in our material recovery facilities our continued pursuit of municipal volumes as well as the addition of new single stream recycling facilities during 2011 contributed to these revenue increases due to volume we also experienced volumerelated revenue increases of 37 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from our strategic growth businesses and our landfill gastoenergy operations additionally our total landfill revenues increased 41 million in 2011 due to higher thirdparty volumes as compared with the prior year primarily driven by higher special waste volumes in our eastern and midwest geographic groups however our landfill municipal solid waste volumes continued to decline in 2011 as compared with the prior year due to economic conditions increased pricing competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers 

in 2010 our collection business accounted for 254 million of the total volumerelated revenue decline we experienced commercial and residential collection volume declines that we attributed to the overall weakness in the economy as well as the effects of pricing competition and diversion of waste by consumers our industrial collection operations were negatively affected by the economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the united states the overall volume decline in the collection line of business was offset in part by an increase in volumes of 99 million associated with oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines in 2010 and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition however in 2010 our landfill revenues increased due to higher thirdparty volumes this increase was principally due to higher special waste volumes in our midwest and southern groups driven in part by our focus on our customers and better meeting their needs 

acquisitions and divestitures  — revenues increased 449 million and 240 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively due to acquisitions the significant revenue increase due to acquisitions in 2011 was principally associated with oakleaf included in our “other” business demonstrating our current focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new complementary lines of business additionally revenue increased due to acquisitions in our collection recycling and wastetoenergy lines of business in both periods divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of 2 million in each of the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include auto liability workers’ compensation general liability and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent property taxes utilities and supplies 

our operating expenses increased 717 million or 92 when comparing 2011 with 2010 and increased 583 million or 81 when comparing 2010 with 2009 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 638 in 2011 625 in 2010 and 614 in 2009 the increases in our operating expenses during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 can largely be attributed to the following 

higher market prices for recyclable commodities — in both 2011 and 2010 increased market prices for recyclable commodities was the main driver of the increase in cost of goods sold as presented in the table below primarily due to customer recycling rebates which also resulted in increased revenues and earnings for the first nine months of 2011 our overall commodity prices increased approximately 26 as compared with the first nine months of the prior year however during the fourth quarter of 2011 we saw a decline of approximately 8 in commodity prices due to higher supply and lower demand during 2010 market prices for recyclable commodities increased significantly from the nearhistoric lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 reflecting a 57 increase in 2010 as compared with 2009 increases in cost of goods sold accounted for 41 and 49 of the yearoveryear increases in total operating expenses during 2011 and 2010 respectively 

fuel cost increases  — higher market prices for fuel caused increases in both our direct fuel costs and our subcontractor costs in both 2011 and 2010 on average diesel fuel prices increased 29 in 2011 and 21 in 2010 as compared with the respective prior years diesel fuel prices averaged 385 299 and 246 per gallon for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we believe the total impact of fuel cost increases when considering both the impact to our direct fuel costs and an estimate of the impact to our subcontractor costs accounted for approximately 23 and 17 of the total yearoveryear increase in operating expenses during 2011 and 2010 respectively increased revenues attributable to our fuel surcharge offset the unfavorable impact of higher fuel costs in 2011 and partially offset the unfavorable impact of higher fuel costs in 2010 

acquisitions and growth initiatives  — in both 2011 and 2010 we experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and our various growth and business development initiatives we estimate that these cost increases which affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below accounted for approximately 42 and 17 of our 717 million and 583 million increases in operating expenses during 2011 and 2010 respectively recent acquisitions included the purchase of oakleaf and a number of collection and recycling operations in particular the acquisition of oakleaf increased operating costs by 213 million in the current year primarily impacting subcontractor costs and to a lesser extent the cost of goods sold and other categories the increase in operating expenses resulting from acquired businesses was more than offset by increased revenues from acquired businesses 

  

canadian exchange rates  — when comparing the average exchange rates for 2011 and 2010 to the prior year the canadian exchange rate strengthened by 4 and 10 respectively which increased our expenses in all operating cost categories the strengthening of the canadian dollar increased our total operating expenses by 20 million for 2011 as compared with 2010 and 52 million for 2010 as compared with 2009 

volume declines  — during 2011 and 2010 we continued to experience volume declines as a result of the ongoing weakness of the overall economic environment pricing competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers we continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines and have achieved cost savings as a result these cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below except for the cost of goods sold category which increased as a result of additional customer rebates due to a 13 increase in recyclable material tons sold in 2011 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 the significant periodtoperiod changes in our operating expenses by category are discussed below 

labor and related benefits — the increases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher hourly and salaried wages due to merit increases and additional expenses incurred from acquisitions and growth opportunities offset in part by cost savings that have been achieved as volumes have declined 

the comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for the periods presented has also been affected by costs incurred primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans these costs increased 2010 expense by 26 million and 2009 expense by 9 million 

maintenance and repairs — comparing 2011 with 2010 the increase was due to higher costs in our geographic groups largely attributable to increased fleet maintenance costs which include services provided by thirdparties tires parts and internal shop labor costs the increase in expense for tires and parts reflects the worldwide increase in commodity prices 

subcontractor costs — the current year increase in subcontractor costs was primarily a result of the oakleaf acquisition increased diesel fuel prices other recent acquisitions our various growth and business development initiatives and additional costs associated with servicing our inplant services customers oakleaf utilizes a nationwide network of thirdparty haulers to service its customers which increased our subcontractor costs by 153 million during the second half of 2011 after completing the acquisition on july 28 2011 these increases were partially offset by the impact of an additional 54 million in prior year costs attributable to oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast during 2010 the 2010 increase in subcontractor costs was largely the result of these oil spill cleanup activities as well as higher diesel fuel prices when compared with 2009 

  

cost of goods sold — the cost increases during 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to increases in the recycling commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result of higher market prices for recyclable commodities the increase in costs in 2011 was also driven by i increases in the volume of materials processed at our existing recycling facilities and ii increases resulting from the oakleaf acquisition and other recently acquired businesses 

fuel — the costs increases for 2011 and 2010 were a result of higher market prices for diesel fuel 

landfill operating costs — the changes in these costs during 2011 and 2010 were due largely to the recognition of additional estimated expense associated with environmental remediation liabilities of 50 million at four closed sites during 2010 during 2011 the company recognized a 9 million favorable revision to an environmental liability at one of these sites based on the estimated cost of the remediation alternative selected by the epa 

the changes in this category for the years presented were also significantly impacted by the changes in us treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets as a result of changes in us treasury rates we recognized 17 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2011 2 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2010 and 35 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 during 2011 the discount rate we use decreased from 350 to 200 over the course of 2010 the discount rate decreased slightly from 375 to 350 and during 2009 the rate increased from 225 to 375 

risk management — the increase in risk management costs during 2011 was primarily a result of increased costs associated with auto and general liability claims in the current year and the prior year recognition of favorable adjustments associated with prior period claims that were higher than similar favorable adjustments recognized during 2011 

other — the 2011 increase was attributable in part to our various growth and business development initiatives and recently acquired businesses including oakleaf these increases were partially offset by prior year costs related to the oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast in 2010 the 2010 increase was attributable in part to our various growth and business development initiatives oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast and recently acquired businesses these cost increases in 2010 were partially offset by an increase in gains recognized from the sale of surplus real estate assets 

selling general and administrative 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefit costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses increased by 90 million or 62 and 97 million or 71 when comparing 2011 with 2010 and 2010 with 2009 respectively the increases in both years are largely due to i increased costs of approximately 53 million and 52 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively incurred to support our strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings including our acquisition of oakleaf in 2011 and ii increased costs of 9 million and 23 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively resulting from improvements we are making to our information technology systems additionally during 2011 we experienced increased consulting costs of 37 million incurred in connection with the startup phase of new cost savings programs focusing on procurement and operational and backoffice efficiency our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 116 in 2011 117 in 2010 and 116 in 2009 

  

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 labor and related benefits  — in 2011 our labor and related benefits costs increased primarily due to i higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by our strategic growth plans optimization initiatives cost savings programs and acquisition of oakleaf ii higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases and iii higher noncash compensation costs incurred for our performance share units and our stock option equity awards granted under our longterm incentive plan or ltip offset partially by lower costs associated with our executive salary deferral plan the costs of which are directly affected by equitymarket conditions the stock option equity awards that the company granted in 2011 and 2010 provide that such options will continue to vest on the schedule provided in the award agreement following an employee’s retirement because retirementeligible employees are not required to provide any future service to vest in these awards we immediately recognized all of the compensation expense associated with stock option awards granted to retirement eligible employees in 2011 the composition of our annual ltip award grant was modified to use stock options to a greater extent and to reduce the number of performance share units awarded accordingly costs increased in 2011 due to the significant increase in the number of stock option awards granted in 2011 over those granted in 2010 and an increase in the number of retirementeligible employees receiving those awards 

in 2010 our labor and related benefits costs increased primarily due to i higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases ii higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by our strategic growth plans iii additional bonus expense in 2010 because our performance against targets established by our annual incentive plans was stronger in 2010 compared with 2009 iv increased contract labor costs as a result of our current focus on optimizing our information technology systems v increased severance costs and vi higher noncash compensation costs incurred for equity awards granted under our ltip during the second quarter of 2009 we reversed all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units based on a determination that it was no longer probable that the targets established for that award would be met additionally during the first quarter of 2010 we immediately recognized all of the compensation expense associated with stock option awards granted to retirementeligible employees we did not incur similar charges in 2009 because this retirement provision was not included in any of the equity awards that were granted during 2009 

professional fees — during 2011 our professional fees increased due to consulting fees primarily associated with the startup phase of new cost savings programs although these fees declined significantly during the second half of the year we have begun to see the associated benefits of these programs and expect the benefits to increase throughout 2012 this increase was offset to a certain extent by lower legal fees in 2011 as compared with 2010 this reduction in legal fees in 2011 was primarily the result of the settlement in 2010 of a lawsuit related to the abandonment of revenue management software 

in 2010 our professional fees increased due to consulting fees driven primarily by improvements we are made to our information technology systems and investments we made to support our strategic growth plans this increase was partially offset by a reduction in legal fees in 2010 as compared with 2009 

provision for bad debts — our provision for bad debts was slightly higher in 2011 as compared with 2010 but both 2011 and 2010 were notably lower than 2009 our provision was higher in 2009 as a result of the company’s assessment of the weak economic environment in the beginning of 2009 and the resulting impacts on our collection risk however due in part to management’s continued focus on the collection of our receivables our collection risk has moderated since 2009 thus resulting in a lower provision in both 2010 and 2011 

  

other — during 2011 and 2010 we experienced increases in our computer costs due in part to improvements we are making to our information technology systems and litigation loss and settlement costs also driving the increase during 2010 was increased marketing and advertising costs driven in part by our strategic growth plans 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 the increases in amortization expense of intangible assets in 2011 and 2010 are due to our focus on the growth and development of our business through acquisitions and other investments the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2011 is primarily related to the amortization of customer lists which were acquired i through our acquisition of oakleaf ii by our southern group and iii by our recycling and electronic brokerage services business the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2010 is primarily related to the amortization of definitelived operating permits acquired by our healthcare solutions operations customer lists acquired by our southern and midwest groups and gas rights acquired by our renewable energy operations 

restructuring 

beginning in july 2011 we took steps to streamline our organization as part of our cost savings programs this reorganization eliminated over 700 employee positions throughout the company including approximately 300 open positions additionally subsequent to our acquisition of oakleaf we incurred charges in connection with restructuring that organization during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized a total of 19 million of pretax restructuring charges of which 18 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with this reorganization 

in january 2009 we streamlined our organization by i consolidating our market areas from 45 market areas to 25 market areas ii integrating the management of our recycling operations with our solid waste businesses in our four geographic groups and iii realigning our corporate organization with this new structure in order to provide support functions more efficiently this restructuring eliminated over 1500 employee positions throughout the company during 2009 we recognized 50 million of pretax charges associated with this restructuring of which 41 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized in 2010 we recognized 2 million of income related to the reversal of pretax restructuring charges recorded in 2009 

  

income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 asset impairments  — during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized impairment charges relating primarily to two facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of the closure of one site and of continuing operating losses at the other site we wrote down the net book values of the sites to their estimated fair values 

through december 31 2008 we capitalized 70 million of accumulated costs associated with the development of a new waste and recycling revenue management system a significant portion of these costs was specifically associated with the purchase of a license for waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use after a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of our smallest market areas the development efforts associated with the revenue management system were suspended in 2007 during 2009 we determined to enhance and improve our existing revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated with the development and implementation of the licensed software accordingly in 2009 we recognized a noncash charge of 51 million for the abandonment of the licensed software 

we recognized an additional 32 million of impairment charges during 2009 27 million of which was recognized by our western group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair a landfill in california as a result of a change in our expectations for the future operations of the landfill the remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a charge required to write down certain of our investments in portable selfstorage operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those operations 

other  — we filed a lawsuit in march 2008 related to the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009 in april 2010 we settled the lawsuit and received a onetime cash payment the settlement increased our “income from operations” for the year ended december 31 2010 by 77 million 

income from operations by reportable segment 

the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

   

reportable segments — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic groups during the threeyear period ended december 31 2011 are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 other significant items affecting the comparability of our groups’ results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 are summarized below 

eastern  — during 2009 the group recognized i an 18 million increase in revenues and income from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of our landfills and ii a 9 million charge related to bargaining unit employees in new jersey agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension fund 

midwest  — the income from operations of our midwest group in 2010 was significantly affected by the recognition of charges of 26 million as a result of employees of five bargaining units in michigan and ohio agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan 

additionally when comparing the average exchange rate in 2010 with 2009 the canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10 which increased the group’s income from operations the effects of foreign currency translation were the most significant to this group because substantially all of our canadian operations are managed by our midwest group 

southern  — the decrease in income from operations of our southern group for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared with 2010 was driven largely by the volume decline previously discussed which includes the unfavorable yearoveryear impact of 2010 project volumes resulting from oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast additionally the group recognized a charge of 11 million in 2011 related to litigation reserves this charge was initially recognized in “other” during the fourth quarter of 2010 

western  — the group’s income from operations included additional “selling general and administrative” expense of 24 million recognized in 2011 as a result of a litigation loss and 12 million recognized in 2010 in connection with a litigation settlement the group’s 2009 income from operations included the recognition of an impairment charge of 27 million as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of an inactive landfill in california 

further affecting the comparison of results was the recognition of 7 million of favorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense during 2010 associated with our obligations for landfill final capping closure and postclosure and net expenses of 5 million recognized for adjustments related to these obligations during 2009 the unfavorable adjustments during 2009 primarily related to a closed landfill in los angeles california for which the group recognized additional amortization expense 

wheelabrator — the decrease in income from operations of our wheelabrator group for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared with 2010 was driven largely by i lower revenues due to the expiration of a longterm electric power capacity agreement that expired december 31 2010 and the expiration of other longterm contracts at our wastetoenergy and independent power facilities ii an increase in yeartodate costs at our facility in portsmouth virginia that we acquired in april 2010 as we 

  

continue to refurbish the facility and iii additional expenses recognized during 2011 for litigation reserves and associated compliance costs a portion of the expenses for litigation reserves and associated costs were initially recognized in “other” during the fourth quarter of 2010 the impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by the efforts to control costs across each of our facilities 

the decrease in the group’s 2010 income from operations as compared with 2009 was driven by an increase in maintenancerelated outages as compared with the prior year which resulted in decreased electricity generation and increased plant maintenance costs these increases were attributable to the acceleration of repair and maintenance expenses at our facility in portsmouth virginia that we acquired in april 2010 and expenses at certain of our other facilities the group also experienced an increase in litigation settlement costs as compared with 2009 these unfavorable items were partially offset by the benefit of increased revenues from the sale of metals 

significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 are summarized below 

other  — our “other” income from operations include i the effects of those elements of our inplant services landfill gastoenergy operations and thirdparty subcontract and administration revenues managed by our sustainability services renewable energy and strategic accounts organizations including oakleaf respectively that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments ii our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services and iii the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings such as portable selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling and in oil and gas producing properties in addition our “other” income from operations reflects the impacts of i nonoperating entities that provide financial assurance and selfinsurance support for the groups or financing for our canadian operations and ii certain yearend adjustments recorded in consolidation related to the reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment profit or loss used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed 

significant items affecting the comparability of income from operations for the periods presented include i the reversal in 2011 of adjustments initially recorded in consolidation in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to our reportable segments which are now included in the measure of segment income from operations in 2011 and ii losses from our growth initiatives the adjustments recorded in consolidation were primarily related to 15 million of additional expense for litigation reserves and associated costs in our southern and wheelabrator groups the losses from our growth initiatives are expected to drive yearoveryear improvements in future periods 

corporate and other  — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 renewable energy operations 

we have extracted value from the waste streams we manage for years and we are focusing on increasing our ability to do so particularly in the field of clean and renewable energy most significantly our current operations produce renewable energy through the wastetoenergy facilities that are managed by our wheelabrator group and our landfill gastoenergy operations we are actively seeking opportunities to enhance our existing renewable energy service offerings to ensure that we can respond to the shifting demands of consumers and to ensure that we are acting as a leader in environmental stewardship 

we are disclosing the following supplemental information related to the operating results of our renewable energy operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 in millions because we believe that it provides information related to the significance of our current renewable energy operations the profitability of these operations and the costs we are incurring to develop these operations 

 

  

  

 interest expense 

our interest expense was 481 million in 2011 473 million in 2010 and 426 million in 2009 when comparing 2011 with 2010 our interest expense increased only slightly in spite of a more significant increase in our debt balances over the course of the year of about 850 million this was primarily attributable to i a decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate that has been achieved by refinancing debt with scheduled maturities in 2011 with debt at much lower fixed interest rates ii the impacts that lower market interest rates had on the cost of certain of our taxexempt debt and iii a 5 million increase in capitalized interest due primarily to higher capital spending in 2011 in 2011 these decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in the benefits provided by active and terminated interest rate swap agreements due to the maturity of the underlying senior notes 

  

when comparing 2010 with 2009 the significant increase in our interest expense was primarily due to i the issuance of an additional 600 million of senior notes in november 2009 to support acquisitions and investments made throughout 2010 ii significantly higher costs related to our revolving credit facility and iii decreased benefits to interest expense provided by active interest rate swaps as a result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps outstanding these increases in interest expense were offset in part by a decline in market interest rates which reduced the interest costs of our taxexempt borrowings and our canadian credit facility 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

beginning in april 2010 our “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” has been primarily related to our noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties as well as i noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and ii unconsolidated trusts for final capping closure postclosure or environmental obligations in january 2011 we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in lowincome housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in provision for income taxes refer to notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded provisions for income taxes of 511 million in 2011 629 million in 2010 and 413 million in 2009 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 336 385 and 281 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes ii the utilization of a capital loss carryback iii the realization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards iv changes in effective state and canadian statutory tax rates v tax audit settlements and vi the impact of federal lowincome housing and refined coal tax credits the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 our acquisition of oakleaf did not materially impact our provision for income taxes or the effective income tax rate for the period ended december 31 2011 we did receive as part of the acquisition income tax attributes primarily federal and state net operating losses while these tax attributes when realized will not affect our overall provision for income taxes they will have a favorable impact on our cash taxes although we do not anticipate the impact to be material to our overall cash flow from operations 

we expect our 2012 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 355 based on expected income levels projected federal tax credits and other permanent items 

the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act signed into law on december 17 2010 included an extension of the bonus depreciation allowance through the end of 2012 and increased the amount of qualifying capital expenditures that can be depreciated immediately from 50 to 100 the 100 depreciation deduction applies to qualifying property placed in service from september 8 2010 through december 31 2011 the acceleration of deductions on 2011 capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provision had no impact on our 2011 effective tax rate however the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our 2011 cash taxes by approximately 190 million taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in future periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken 

noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 48 million in 2011 49 million in 2010 and 66 million in 2009 these amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator group the comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has been affected by i our january 2010 acquisition of a controlling financial interest in a portable selfstorage business and ii the deconsolidation of certain final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation trusts as a result of our implementation of authoritative accounting guidance effective january 1 2010 associated with variable interest entities refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the consolidation of these variable interest entities 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

we owned or operated 266 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2011 and 2010 at december 31 2011 and 2010 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2011 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 42 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 33 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 48 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

  

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2011 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

  

  

 the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 in millions 

 

  

  

  

   

 the tons received at our landfills in 2011 and 2010 are shown below tons in thousands 

 

  

  

 when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2011 our closed sites management group managed 207 closed landfills 

landfill assets  — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2011 and 2010 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2011 in millions 

 

   

as of december 31 2011 we estimate that we will spend approximately 400 million in 2012 and approximately 1 billion in 2013 and 2014 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities  — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2011 and 2010 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2011 in millions 

 

 landfill costs and expenses  — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 the comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds with a term approximating the weightedaverage period until settlement of the underlying obligations additionally in 2010 we increased our cost estimates associated with environmental remediation obligations primarily based on a review and evaluation of existing remediation projects as these remediation projects progressed more defined plans were developed resulting in a net increase in remediation expense to reflect the more likely remedies in 2011 we had a favorable revision to an environmental remediation liability at a closed site based on the estimated cost of the remediation alternative selected by the epa 

  

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

 amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

the following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis 

 

 different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 271 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear the comparability of our total company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations landfill amortization expense was reduced by 11 million in 2011 13 million in 2010 and 14 million in 2009 for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities ii effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction or iii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v final capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and vii capital expenditures acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments and share repurchases 

  

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2011 and 2010 in millions 

 

 cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less our cash and cash equivalents have decreased as a result of the execution of our strategic growth plans which has increased our level of capital spending acquisitions and investments 

restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of i funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations and ii funds received from the issuance of taxexempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or facilities these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

debt  — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2011 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 were primarily due to i net debt borrowings of 698 million ii 100 million in noncash proceeds from taxexempt borrowings and ii the impacts of accounting for other noncash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps foreign currency translation interest accretion and capital leases 

as of december 31 2011 we had i 925 million of debt maturing within twelve months including 150 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility us137 million of advances outstanding under our canadian credit facility 400 million of 6375 senior notes that mature in november 2012 and 168 million of taxexempt bonds and ii 305 million of fixedrate taxexempt borrowings subject to repricing within the next twelve months under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states this debt must be classified as current unless we have the intent and ability to refinance it on a longterm basis we have the intent and ability to refinance 599 million of this debt on a longterm basis and have classified the remaining 631 million as current obligations as of december 31 2011 in january 2012 we borrowed an additional 50 million under our revolving credit facility increasing the total loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility to 200 million 

  

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit in millions at december 31 categorized by type of facility 

 

  

  

  

 summary of cash flow activity 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2011 as compared with 2010 are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

   

 the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below 

 

 the comparison of our 2010 and 2009 income from operations was also affected by a 91 million increase in noncash charges attributable to i equitybased compensation expense ii interest accretion on landfill liabilities iii interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets iv depreciation and amortization and v the impact of the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multiemployer pension plans while these increases in noncash charges unfavorably affected our earnings comparison there was no impact on net cash provided by operating activities 

 

  

  

  

  

 net cash used in investing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

   

  

  

 we made 173 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2010 these cash investments were primarily related to a 142 million payment made to acquire a 40 equity investment in shanghai environment group a subsidiary of shanghai chengtou holding co ltd as a joint venture partner in seg we participate in the operation and management of wastetoenergy and other waste services in the chinese market seg’s focus also includes building new wastetoenergy facilities in china 

 

 net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

 we paid 575 million for share repurchases in 2011 compared with 501 million in 2010 and 226 million in 2009 we repurchased approximately 17 million 15 million and 7 million shares of our common stock in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we did not repurchase shares during the first half of 2009 given the state of the economy and the financial markets in the second half of 2009 we resumed repurchases of our common stock following improvements in the economy and capital markets 

we paid an aggregate of 637 million in cash dividends during 2011 compared with 604 million in 2010 and 569 million in 2009 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 029 in 2009 to 0315 in 2010 and to 034 in 2011 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs 

in december 2011 we announced that our board of directors expects to increase the per share quarterly dividend from 034 to 0355 for dividends declared in 2012 however all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future business plans and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in december 2011 the board of directors approved up to 500 million in share repurchases for 2012 however future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the board of directors in making dividend declarations 

  

  

  

  

 this summary excludes the impacts of noncash borrowings and debt repayments for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2009 these noncash financing activities were primarily associated with our taxexempt bond financings proceeds from taxexempt bond issuances net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds were 100 million and 105 million respectively during the year ended december 31 2010 we did not have any taxexempt bond financings however we did have a 215 million noncash increase in our debt obligations as a result of the issuance of a note payable in return for a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties this investment is discussed in detail in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   

summary of contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

liquidity impacts of uncertain tax positions 

as discussed in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are primarily included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet because the company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2011 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

inflation 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of diesel fuel have affected our operating margins in recent years we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2011 over 17 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

new accounting pronouncements 

fair value measurements  — in may 2011 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements this amended guidance defines certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements were effective for the company on january 1 2012 and are to be applied prospectively we do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount as of december 31 2011 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 

interest rate exposure  — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs which are discussed in the financial assurance and insurance obligations section of item 1 

as of december 31 2011 we had 97 billion of longterm debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives discounts and premiums the effective interest rates of approximately 22 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2012 the most significant components of our variablerate debt obligations are i 1 billion of “receive fixed pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixedrate senior notes ii 611 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process iii 305 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within twelve months iv 150 million of borrowings outstanding under our 20 billion revolving credit facility and 

  

v us137 million of outstanding advances under our canadian credit facility we currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2012 interest expense by approximately 18 million as of december 31 2010 the effective interest rates of approximately 18 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within twelve months 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our “fixedrate” tax exempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months in addition at december 31 2011 we had forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 375 million the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately 805 million at december 31 2011 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

commodity price exposure  — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including old corrugated cardboard old newsprint and plastics and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives which are discussed below we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended december 31 2011 alternatively we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues also increase or decrease 

during 2011 approximately 54 of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates and we currently expect that nearly 56 of our electricity revenues at our wastetoenergy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2012 our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased over the last few years as longterm power purchase agreements have expired the energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that the current market structure does not support medium and longterm electricity contracts as we renegotiate our powerpurchase agreements we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our wastetoenergy facilities will be based on variable market rates accordingly in 2010 we implemented a more actively managed energy program which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives 

currency rate exposure  — we have operations in canada and investments in china and the united kingdom from time to time we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives the foreign currency exposure associated with our investments in china and the united kingdom has not been material

we are the leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in north america our subsidiaries provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we are also a leading developer operator and owner of wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy facilities in the united states our customers include residential commercial industrial and municipal customers throughout north america during 2010 our largest customer represented approximately 2 of annual revenues we employed approximately 42800 people as of december 31 2010 

 

through our core waste management services we own or operate 271 landfill sites which is the largest network of landfills in our industry in order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets where the distance to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities is typically farther we manage 294 transfer stations that consolidate compact and transport waste efficiently and economically we also use waste to create energy one method we use involves recovering the naturally occurring gas in landfills for use in the generation of electricity we also use waste to create energy through a highly efficient combustion process our wastetoenergy subsidiary wheelabrator technologies inc operates 22 plants that produce clean renewable energy we are a leading recycler in north america handling materials that include paper cardboard glass plastic metal and electronics through our recycling operations we provide costefficient environmentally sound programs for municipalities businesses and households across the us and canada in addition to traditional waste operations we are also expanding to increase the service offerings we provide for our customers 

 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry the waste industry continues to confront significant changes in recent years landfill volumes have declined and customers are increasingly using alternatives to traditional disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the waste they generate accomplishment of our goals will grow our company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  we believe that helping our customers achieve their environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth 

 

our strategic focus is centered on three longterm goals know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we 

manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency we intend to pursue achievement of our longterm goals in the shortterm through efforts to 

 

  

we believe that execution of our strategy including making the investments required by our strategy will provide longterm value to our stockholders in addition we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividend payments in december 2010 we announced that our board of directors expects that quarterly dividend payments will be increased to 034 per share in 2011 which is an 8 increase from the quarterly dividend we paid in 2010 this will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the eighth consecutive year and is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows all quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors 

 

operations 

 

general 

 

we manage and evaluate our principal operations through five groups our four geographic operating groups comprised of our eastern midwest southern and western groups provide collection transfer disposal in both solid waste and hazardous waste landfills and recycling services our fifth group is the wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants or ipps we also provide additional services that are not managed through our five groups as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

 

the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our groups or reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

 

the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

 

 

 

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2010 we owned or operated 266 solid waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation a landfill must meet federal state or provincial and local regulations during its design construction operation and closure the operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing the cap of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace 

 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill the significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and as a result thirdparty haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

we also operate five secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

 

transfer at december 31 2010 we owned or operated 294 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

 

wheelabrator as of december 31 2010 we owned or operated 17 wastetoenergy facilities and five independent power production plants which are located in the northeast in the midatlantic and in florida california and washington 

 

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam as of december 31 2010 our wastetoenergy facilities were capable of processing up to 22300 tons of solid waste each day in 2010 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 75 million tons of solid waste or approximately 20700 tons per day 

 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

 

we generate steam at our wastetoenergy and ipp facilities for the production of electricity we sell the electricity produced at our facilities into wholesale markets which include investorowned utilities power marketers and regional power pools some of our facilities also sell steam directly to end users fees charged for electricity and steam at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps have generally been subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market conditions such as inflation electricity prices and other general market factors during 2010 and 2009 several of our longterm energy contracts and shortterm pricing arrangements expired significantly increasing our wastetoenergy revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in market prices for electricity which generally correlate with fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets in which we operate our marketprice 

volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire we use shortterm “receive fixed pay variable” electricity commodity swaps to mitigate the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity refer to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section of this report for additional information about the company’s current considerations related to the management of this market exposure 

 

we continue to look at opportunities to expand our wastetoenergy business in 2010 we made two investments which increased the total assets of our wheelabrator group by 318 million for the year ended december 31 2010 in the first quarter of 2010 we paid 142 million to acquire a 40 equity investment in shanghai environment group “seg” a subsidiary of shanghai chengtou holding co ltd as a joint venture partner in seg we will participate in the operation and management of wastetoenergy and other waste services in the chinese market seg will also focus on building new wastetoenergy facilities in china as of december 31 2010 seg owned and operated two wastetoenergy facilities five landfills and five transfer stations an additional five wastetoenergy facilities were under construction our share of seg’s earnings are included in “equity in net losses in unconsolidated entities” in our consolidated statement of operations in the second quarter of 2010 we paid 150 million for the acquisition of a wastetoenergy facility in portsmouth virginia additionally wheelabrator is actively pursuing development projects with industry partners and pursuing other opportunities to provide wastetoenergy services in the united kingdom 

 

recycling our recycling operations focus on improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs within communities and industries in 2001 we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

 

materials processing  — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing we operate 98 mrfs where paper cardboard metals plastics glass construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale we also operate nine secondary processing facilities where recyclable materials can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods materials processing services include data destruction and automated color sorting 

 

plastics materials recycling  — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

 

commodities recycling  — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

 

fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of recyclable commodities being processed the volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

 

some of the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the processed goods to our customers to whom we sell such materials the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods and on market conditions but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum perton rates as a result changes in commodity prices for recycled fiber can significantly affect our revenues the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our operating income and margins 

other other services not managed within our groups include the following 

 

we provide recycling brokerage services which includes managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with little to no capital requirements we also provide electronics recycling we recycle discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials in recent years we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “takeback” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner 

 

we provide sustainability services to businesses through our upstream ® and green squad ® organizations this includes inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing waste they generate identifying recycling opportunities and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal 

 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the epa endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2010 landfill gas beneficial use projects were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 127 of our solid waste landfills at 97 of these landfills the processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 21 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at nine landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

 

our wm healthcare solutions subsidiary offers integrated medical waste services for healthcare facilities pharmacies and individuals we provide fullservice solutions to facilities to assist them in best practices identifying waste streams and proper disposal our healthcare services also include a sharps mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose of their used syringes and lancets using our medwaste tracker system 

 

although by their very nature many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our strategic accounts program works with customers whose locations span the united states our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs 

 

we also have begun investing in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the collection of project waste including construction debris and household or yard waste through our bagster ® program the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology part of our expansion of services includes offering portable selfstorage services and fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program in addition at a time when oil prices were low we decided to pursue investment opportunities that involved acquisition and development of nonworking interests in oil and gas producing properties 

 

finally we rent portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  we service such facilities and we provide street and parking lot sweeping services 

competition 

 

the waste industry is very competitive in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including smaller companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 

 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on service offerings as companies individuals and communities begin to look for ways to be more sustainable we are ensuring our customers know about our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste 

 

seasonal trends 

 

our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the traditional seasonal increase in the volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends although we saw a significantly weaker seasonal volume increase during 2009 than we generally experience 

 

additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our southern group can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions including severe winter storms may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2010 we had approximately 42800 fulltime employees of which approximately 7600 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 9300 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

 

financial assurance 

 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits various forms of financial assurance also are required to support variablerate taxexempt debt and by regulatory agencies for estimated capping closure postclosure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills 

 

we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table 

summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

 9 

 

  

virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in 2010 we experienced an increase in costs associated with letters of credit as a result of the june 2010 refinancing of our revolving credit facility we actively monitor our financial assurance needs and optimize the utilization of lowercost instruments when possible to minimize our costs 

 

insurance 

 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2010 our general liability insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 25 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried selfinsurance exposures of up to 5 million per incident as of december 31 2010 our auto liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 5 million subject to additional deductibles of 48 million in the 5 million to 10 million layer we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2010 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability often referred to as “broad form side a” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage often referred to as “side b” the side a policy covers directors and officers directly for loss including defense costs when corporate indemnification is unavailable side aonly coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the company as the company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers 

 

regulation 

 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us epa and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

 

because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

 11 

  

the epa has issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years 

 

  

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not otherwise preempted by federal law additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling 

 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretation of flow control legislation or the supreme court decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness 

to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of regulations on our current and future operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “forecast” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of similar nature and generally include statements containing 

 

  

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2011 and beyond 

 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our operating margins 

 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers and our ability to implement our pricing strategy in addition to disruption in the credit markets recent and continuing economic conditions have negatively affected business and consumer spending generally if our commercial customers do not have access to capital both our volumes and our ability to increase new business will be negatively impacted 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources including smaller companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition competitors may reduce 

their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitivelybid contracts when this happens we may be unable to execute our pricing strategy resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

 

if we fail to implement our business strategy our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully we have adopted a business strategy built on three key initiatives know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage and continuously improve our operational efficiency in the shortterm we intend to pursue these initiatives through efforts to 

 

  

there are risks involved in pursuing our strategy including the following 

 

  

in addition to the risks set forth above implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as increased competition legal developments government regulation general economic conditions increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends further we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully our longterm growth and profitability may be adversely affected even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate or at all 

 

the seasonal nature of our business and “onetime” special projects cause our results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we 

operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes that most often impact our southern group can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected while weatherrelated and other “onetime” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work as a result of significant startup costs and other factors such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins during 2010 our financial results included revenue generated as a result of cleanup efforts in connection with the oil spill along the gulf coast and the substantial flooding in tennessee however these special projects have a limited time span 

 

certain weather conditions including severe weather storms may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period 

 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities 

 

there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of waste materials under applicable environmental laws and regulations we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy partially though acquisitions because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations further the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us additionally we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past we are currently and we may in the future become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

 

further we often enter into contractual arrangements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements compliance with these arrangements is inherently subject to subjective determinations and may result in disputes including litigation costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business and compliance with such regulations is costly a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

 

we also have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills we establish accruals for these estimated costs but we could underestimate such accruals environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping closure postclosure and remediation costs requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals 

 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state additionally several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretation of flow control legislation or the supreme court decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

 

efforts to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change continue to advance on the federal regional and state level our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg in the 111th congress the us house of representatives passed a bill that would regulate ghgs comprehensively while the centerpiece of that bill would be a ghg emission allowance capandtrade system neither landfills nor qualifying wastetoenergy plants would be compelled to hold allowances for their ghg emissions rather they would be subject to certain further emission controls to be determined through administrative rulemaking should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control ghg emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority in 2010 the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule “psd tailoring rule” the rule sets new 

thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required under the psd and title v programs the epa’s legal authority to “tailor” statutory thresholds in this rule has been challenged and the epa intends to delay regulation of certain emissions pending further regulatory analysis we cannot predict the final requirements of stationary source rules that might apply to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities as a result of this rulemaking and accordingly further developments in this area could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

 

our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand 

 

we believe we have developed a reputation for highquality service reliability and social and environmental responsibility and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes the waste management brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

 

significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

 

the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we have seen average quarterly fuel prices increase by as much as 30 on a yearoveryear basis and decrease by as much as 47 on a yearoveryear basis within the last two years we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs additionally we are currently party to a pending suit that pertains to our fuel and environmental charge and generally alleges that such charges were not properly disclosed were unfair and were contrary to contract see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs the increased operating costs will decrease our operating margins 

 

some of our customers including governmental entities have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties due to the downturn in the us economy and reduced tax revenue some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates many nongovernmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties and the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates could negatively affect our operating results 

 

in addition the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates as of december 31 2010 we had 611 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and 405 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our taxexempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variablerate taxexempt debt capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit if we determine a development or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may be required to incur charges against earnings if we determine that events such as those described cause impairments any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard known as occ and old newsprint or onp the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively as we experienced in 2008 or positively as we experienced in 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2008 the monthly market prices for occ and onp fell by 79 and 72 respectively from their high points within the year additionally the decline in market prices for commodities resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in revenue of 447 million in 2009 increases in the prices of recycling commodities in 2010 resulted in an increase in revenues of 423 million as compared with 2009 market prices for recyclable commodities have increased significantly from the nearhistoric lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 for the twelve months of 2010 overall commodity 

prices have increased approximately 57 as compared with 2009 despite the recent positive trend in commodity prices these prices may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase in other circumstances the rebates may be subject to a floor such that as market prices decrease any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are eliminated 

 

there are also significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations that can significantly impact our revenue from yield provided by such businesses in most of the markets in which we operate electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices for the year ended december 31 2009 we experienced declines in revenue from yield at our wastetoenergy facilities of 76 million due to the expiration of certain abovemarket contracts resulting in greater exposure to market pricing during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 47 46 and 24 respectively of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates our wastetoenergy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire we enter into “receive fixed pay variable” electricity swaps to mitigate the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity these swaps are generally shortterm in nature additionally revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations if we are unable to successfully negotiate longterm contracts or if market prices are at lower levels for sustained periods our revenues could be adversely affected 

 

the development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

 

our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate in addition several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard and food waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or wastetoenergy facility large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills zerowaste goals sending no waste to the landfill have been set by many of north america’s largest companies although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as affecting the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services our landfills and our wastetoenergy facilities currently provide and have historically provided our highest operating margins if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely then our revenues and operating results will decline additionally despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business it is reasonably possible that our revenues and our operating margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

 

labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 

 

we have participated in and contributed to various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by employer and union trustees in renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that participate in these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in various plans when we withdraw from plans we can incur withdrawal liabilities for those plans that have underfunded pension liabilities various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan the ongoing solvency of participating employers the investment returns obtained on plan assets and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation we reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet 

 

we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans and we recognized related expenses of 26 million in 2010 9 million in 2009 and 39 million in 2008 we are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for these previous withdrawals which could be materially higher than the charges we have recognized 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

 

we may experience problems with either the operation of our current information technology systems or the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

if we are not able to develop and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology our financial results may suffer 

 

our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we develop or license and protect new technologies we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market further protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources additionally a competitor may develop or obtain exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors our financial results may suffer 

 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods 

our capital requirements could increase our expenses or cause us to change our growth and development plans 

 

recent economic conditions have reduced our cash flows from operations and could do so in the future if impacts on our cash flows from operations are significant we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures growth activity dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities and there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income further our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected 

 

additionally we have 18 billion of debt as of december 31 2010 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next twelve months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds our interest rate swap agreements and borrowings outstanding under our canadian credit facility therefore increases in interest rates can increase our interest expenses which also would lower our net income and decrease our cash flow 

 

we may use our threeyear 20 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2010 we had 1138 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 862 million in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2010 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

our 2010 results of operations reflect our discipline in pricing our ability to control costs in our collection and disposal operations and our continued investment in our strategic initiatives which will enable us to grow into new markets provide expanded service offerings and improve our information technology systems our results also reflect an improvement in the general economic environment highlights of our financial results for 2010 include 

 

  

  

  

the comparability of our 2010 results with 2009 has been affected by certain items management believes are not representative or indicative of our performance our 2010 results were affected by the following 

 

 26 

 

  

our 2009 results were affected by the following 

 

  

we are pleased about the lower rate of decline in internal revenue growth from volumes that we experienced during 2010 on the pricing front our fourth quarter 2010 results were the strongest of the year for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010 we outpaced our longterm pricing objective of achieving price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above the consumer price index or cpi in 2011 we will remain committed to our pricing discipline based on an anticipated cpi runrate of 10 we expect our overall revenue growth from yield to be approximately 20 additionally we expect our revenue growth from volumes to be flat to slightly positive however we are mindful of trends toward waste reduction at the source diversion from landfills and customers seeking alternative methods of disposal we will continue to implement measures that we believe will grow our business improve our current operations performance and enhance and expand our services 

 

free cash flow 

 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable us gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity nonetheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

 

our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below in millions and may not be the same as similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

 

our free cash flow was consistent in both years however our cash provided by operating activities decreased 87 million and our capital expenditures decreased 75 million the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net unfavorable changes in working capital increased interest payments and higher income tax payments these decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by a cash benefit of 77 million resulting from a litigation settlement that occurred in april 2010 payments made in 2009 related to severance and benefits costs associated with our 2009 restructuring also affected the comparability of our operating cash flow for the periods presented 

 

the decrease in capital expenditures in 2010 compared with 2009 can generally be attributed to timing of cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital expenditures we generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of each year a less significant portion of our fourth quarter 2009 capital expenditures were paid for in cash in 2010 as compared with the portion of our fourth quarter 2008 capital expenditures that were paid for in cash in 2009 

 

our ability to generate over 12 billion in free cash flow in 2010 enabled us to return 11 billion in cash to stockholders during the year through the payment of 604 million in dividends and the repurchase of 501 million of our common stock 

 

basis of presentation of consolidated financial information 

 

consolidation of variable interest entities  — in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities the new guidance primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and is therefore required to consolidate the entity this new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that has i the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could be significant from the perspective of the entity the new guidance also requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events 

 

as a result of our implementation of this guidance effective january 1 2010 we deconsolidated certain capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation trusts because we share power over significant activities of these trusts with others our financial interests in these entities are discussed in note 20 of our consolidated financial statements the deconsolidation of these trusts has not materially affected our financial position results of operations or cash flows during the periods presented 

 

business combinations  — in december 2007 the fasb issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated with business combinations this guidance clarified and revised the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree this guidance also addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements related to business combinations effective january 1 2009 we adopted the fasb’s revised guidance associated with business combinations the portions of this guidance that relate to business combinations completed before january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements further business combinations completed subsequent to january 1 2009 which are discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements have not been material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows however to the extent that future business combinations are material our adoption of the fasb’s revised authoritative guidance associated with business combinations may significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions principally as a result of i expanded requirements to value acquired assets liabilities and contingencies at their fair values when such amounts can be determined and ii the requirement that acquisitionrelated transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition 

 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  — in december 2007 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary the guidance also established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated 

financial statements we adopted this guidance on january 1 2009 the presentation and disclosure requirements of this guidance which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented resulted in reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial information and the remeasurement of our 2008 effective tax rate which is discussed in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements 

 

fair value measurements  — in september 2006 the fasb issued authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements this guidance defined fair value established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb delayed the effective date of the guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis accordingly we adopted this guidance for assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis effective january 1 2008 and adopted the guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis effective january 1 2009 the application of the fair value framework did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

refer to note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position 

 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methods in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and selfinsured claims each of these items is discussed in additional detail below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

landfills 

 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each capping event 

 

landfill costs  — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

 

capping costs  — we estimate the cost for each capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate landfill capping costs to specific capping events the landfill capacity associated with each capping event is then quantified and the capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately 

through expense when the change in estimate relates to a capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

closure and postclosure costs  — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

remaining permitted airspace  — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

 

expansion airspace  — we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 33 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2010 14 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace eight of these landfills required approval by our chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining six landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one or fiveyear requirements 

 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor or auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multi level review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

 

environmental remediation liabilities 

 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on

asset impairments 

 

our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we monitor the carrying value of our longlived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable these events or changes in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market for similar assets if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our consolidated statement of operations estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 

 

there are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below 

 

landfills  — certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry 

 

goodwill  — at least annually we assess our goodwill for impairment we assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value including goodwill we use a combination of two valuation methods a market approach and an income approach to estimate the fair value of our operating segments fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our operating segments 

 

the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics of our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows we then apply that multiple to our operating segments’ cash flows to estimate their fair values we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our operating segments 

 

the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of our operating segments we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business 

 

additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that more likely than not the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment considerations made during the reported periods 

deferred income taxes 

 

deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 

 

insured and selfinsured claims 

 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

 

results of operations 

 

operating revenues 

 

we manage and evaluate our principal operations through five groups our four geographic groups comprised of our eastern midwest southern and western groups provide collection transfer disposal in both solid waste and hazardous waste landfills and recycling services our fifth group is the wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services and manages wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants these five groups are our reportable segments we also provide additional services that are not managed through our five groups including recycling brokerage services electronic recycling services inplant services landfill gastoenergy services and the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings such as portable selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling these operations are presented as “other” in the table below shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our five groups and our other waste services 

 

 

 

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer recycling and wastetoenergy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the mrf or disposal facility and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services 

generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for fuel our wastetoenergy revenues which are generated by our wheelabrator group are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam our “other” revenues include our landfill gastoenergy operations portolet ® services portable selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements the mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 

 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

our revenues increased 724 million or 61 and decreased 1597 million or 119 for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the yearoveryear change in revenues for both periods has been driven by i market factors including fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices that favorably impacted revenue growth in 2010 and negatively affected revenue growth in 2009 volatility in diesel prices that affects the revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program which favorably contributed to our revenues in 2010 and negatively affected our revenues in 2009 and foreign currency translation which favorably affected revenues from our canadian operations in 2010 but negatively impacted our revenues in 2009 ii revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations in both periods and iii acquisitions further affecting revenue changes were revenue declines due to lower volumes that generally resulted from the continued weakness of the overall economic environment increased pricing competition and recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers 

 

the following provides further details associated with our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

 

average yield 

 

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer landfill and wastetoenergy disposal operations exclusive of volume changes 

revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

 

in both 2010 and 2009 our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield demonstrates our commitment to our pricing strategies despite the current economic environment this increase in revenue from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations which experienced yield growth in all lines of business and in every geographic operating group we have found that increasing our yield in today’s market is a challenge given the reduced volume levels resulting from the economic slowdown however revenue growth from yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs have provided margin improvements in our collection line of business additionally a significant portion of our collection revenues is generated under longterm agreements with municipalities or similar local or regional authorities these agreements generally tie pricing adjustments to inflation indices which have been low in 2010 as compared with 2009 and 2008 despite this headwind we continue to meet our pricing objective of achieving price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above cpi we are committed to maintaining pricing discipline in order to improve yield on our base business 

 

revenues from our environmental fee which are included in average yield on collection and disposal increased by 33 million and 37 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively environmental fee revenues totaled 251 million in 2010 as compared with 218 million in 2009 and 181 million in 2008 

 

recycling commodities  — increases in the prices of the recycling commodities we process resulted in an increase in revenues of 423 million in 2010 as compared with 2009 market prices for recyclable commodities have increased significantly from the nearhistoric lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 for the twelve months of 2010 overall commodity prices have increased approximately 57 as compared with 2009 

 

in 2009 lower recycling commodity prices were the principal driver of our revenue decline of 447 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 we saw a rapid decline in commodity prices from the recordhigh prices we had been experiencing prior to the decline due to a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and internationally commodity demand and prices in the first nine months of 2009 remained well below the demand and prices in the comparable prioryear period 

 

electricity  — the changes in revenue from yield provided by our wastetoenergy business are largely due to fluctuations in rates we can receive for electricity under our power purchase contracts and in merchant transactions in most of the markets in which we operate electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices we experienced declines in revenue from yield at our wastetoenergy facilities of 7 million and 76 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively these declines are due to the expiration of certain abovemarket contracts resulting in greater exposure to market pricing in 2010 approximately 47 of the wastetoenergy generation portfolio was subject to market price movements compared with 46 in 2009 and 24 in 2008 our wastetoenergy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will continue to increase as additional longterm contracts expire however we are beginning to see an improvement in market pricing in addition we have increased our hedging activities to better manage this risk 

 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — revenue predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased by 69 million and decreased by 328 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the fluctuation is directly attributed to the fluctuation in the national average prices of diesel fuel that we use for our fuel surcharge program the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the passthrough to customers of fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above 

 

volume  — our revenue decline due to volume was 304 million or 26 for the year ended december 31 2010 this is a notable improvement in the rate of revenue decline from the prioryear period when revenue decline due to volume was 1078 million or 81 volume declines are generally attributable to economic conditions increased pricing competition and recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers 

in 2010 our collection business accounted for 254 million of the total volumerelated revenue decline we have experienced commercial and residential collection volume declines that we attribute to the overall weakness in the economy as well as the effects of pricing competition and diversion of waste by consumers our industrial collection operations continued to be affected by the current economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the united states the overall volume decline in the collection line of business was offset in part by an increase in volumes of 99 million associated with oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines in the currentyear period and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition however in 2010 our landfill revenues increased due to higher thirdparty volumes this increase was principally due to higher special waste volumes in our midwest and southern geographic groups which were driven in part by our continued focus on our customers and better meeting their needs 

 

we are pleased with the lessening rate of revenue decline due to lower volumes however i the continued weakness of the overall economic environment ii recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers and iii pricing and competition are presenting challenges to maintaining and growing volumes 

 

in 2009 our collection business accounted for 622 million of the total volume decline our industrial collection operations experienced the most significant revenue declines due to lower volumes primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in both residential and commercial construction activities across the united states we also experienced volume declines in our commercial and residential collection lines of businesses in 2009 we attributed these volume declines to the economy although at a lesser rate than our industrial line of business since they are somewhat recession resistant as well as to pricing and competition 

 

in 2009 we also experienced a 16 decline in thirdparty revenue due to volume at our landfills this decrease was most significant in our more economically sensitive special waste and construction and demolition waste streams although municipal solid waste streams at our landfills also decreased lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition lower volumes in our recycling operations caused declines in revenues of 74 million in 2009 these decreases were attributable to the drastic decline in the domestic and international demand for recyclables in late 2008 

 

acquisitions and divestitures  — revenues increased 240 million and 97 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively due to acquisitions principally in i the collection and recycling lines of business in both periods as well as our wastetoenergy line of business in 2010 and ii our “other” businesses demonstrating our current focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new complementary lines of business divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of 2 million and 37 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

operating expenses 

 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent and property taxes 

our operating expenses increased 583 million or 81 when comparing 2010 with 2009 and decreased by 1225 million or 145 when comparing 2009 with 2008 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 625 in 2010 614 in 2009 and 632 in 2008 the changes in our operating expenses during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 can largely be attributed to the following 

 

changes in market prices for recyclable commodities  — overall market prices for recyclable commodities were approximately 57 higher on average during 2010 than in 2009 the yearoveryear increase is the result of the recovery in recyclable commodity prices from the nearhistoric lows reached in late 2008 and early 2009 this increase in market prices was the driver of the current year increase in cost of goods sold primarily customer rebates and has also resulted in increased revenues and earnings this year when comparing 2009 with 2008 market prices for recyclable commodities had the opposite effect on our results as they declined approximately 39 

 

acquisitions and growth initiatives  — in both 2010 and 2009 we experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and our various growth and business development initiatives these cost increases have affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below 

 

fuel price changes  — higher market prices for fuel caused increases in both our direct fuel costs and our subcontractor costs for the year ended december 31 2010 while lower market prices caused decreases in these costs for the year ended december 31 2009 on average diesel fuel prices increased 21 to 299 per gallon for 2010 from 246 per gallon for 2009 while they decreased in 2009 by 35 from 381 per gallon in 2008 

 

canadian exchange rates  — when comparing the average exchange rate for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 the canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10 which increased our expenses in all operating cost categories the strengthening of the canadian dollar increased our total operating expenses by 52 million for 2010 as compared with 2009 when comparing 2009 with 2008 the canadian exchange rate weakened by 7 and decreased our total operating expenses by 40 million 

 

volume declines and divestitures  — throughout 2010 and 2009 we experienced volume declines as a result of the continued weakness of the overall economic environment pricing competition and recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers note that the revenue decline due to lower volume moderated in 2010 as compared with the volume decline in 2009 particularly in the second half of the year during 2009 we also experienced volume declines as a result of divestitures we continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines and have achieved significant cost savings as a result these cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

the periodtoperiod changes for each category of operating expenses are discussed below 

 

labor and related benefits  — our 2010 expenses increased as a result of i higher salaries and wages due to merit increases that were effective in july 2009 for hourly employees and in april 2010 for both salaried and hourly employees ii additional expenses incurred for acquisitions and growth opportunities and iii the strengthening of the canadian dollar these cost increases were offset in part by cost savings that have been achieved as volumes declined 

 

when comparing 2009 with 2008 the cost declines were generally a result of i headcount and overtime reductions related to volume declines ii effects of foreign currency translation iii a benefit from the restructuring we initiated in january of 2009 although most of these savings were reflected in our selling general and administrative expenses and iv cost savings provided by our operational improvement initiatives these cost savings were offset in part by higher hourly wages due to merit increases and increased bonus expense as our performance against targets established by our incentive plans was stronger than it had been in 2008 

 

the comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for the periods presented has also been affected by costs incurred primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans these costs increased 2010 expense by 26 million 2009 expense by 9 million and 2008 expense by 42 million 

 

transfer and disposal costs — during 2009 the cost decreases as compared with 2008 were a result of volume declines and our continued focus on reducing disposal costs associated with our thirdparty disposal volumes by improving internalization this decrease was also partially due to foreign currency translation 

 

maintenance and repairs — comparing 2009 with 2008 these costs declined as a result of volume declines and various fleet initiatives that favorably affected our maintenance parts and supplies costs these decreases were offset partially by cost increases due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy facilities 

 

subcontractor costs  — the 2010 increase in subcontractor costs is largely the result of oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast and is also attributable to higher diesel fuel prices we incurred 54 million in subcontractor costs related to oil spill cleanup activities this year when comparing 2009 with 2008 the cost decreases are a result of volume declines a significant decrease in diesel fuel prices and the effects of foreign currency translation 

 

cost of goods sold — the cost changes during the years presented are principally due to changes in the recycling commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result of changes in market prices for recyclable commodities 

 

fuel — the cost changes for 2010 and 2009 are a result of changes in market prices for diesel fuel and volume declines 

 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — these cost decreases in 2009 as compared with 2008 are principally a result of volume declines 

 

landfill operating costs  — increases in these costs in the current year were due in part to the recognition of additional estimated expense associated with environmental remediation liabilities of 50 million at four closed sites during 2010 

 

the changes in this category for the years presented were also significantly impacted by the changes in us treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets as a result of changes in us treasury rates we recognized 2 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2010 compared with 35 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 and 33 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2008 over the course of 2010 the discount rate we use decreased slightly from 375 to 350 although it reached as low as 250 in september during 2009 the rate increased from 225 to 375 and during 2008 the rate declined from 400 to 225 

risk management — the slight yearoveryear decrease in 2010 and the consistent cost levels in 2009 and 2008 reflect the success we have had over the last several years in managing these costs which can be credited primarily to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates 

 

other — the comparison of these costs has been significantly affected by the following 

 

  

selling general and administrative 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor and related benefit costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other selling general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses increased by 97 million or 71 when comparing 2010 with 2009 and decreased 113 million or 77 when comparing 2009 with 2008 the current year increase is largely due to i increased costs of 52 million during 2010 incurred to support our strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings and ii increased costs of 23 million during 2010 resulting from improvements we are making to our information technology systems when comparing 2009 with 2008 the decrease was due in part to i the realization of benefits associated with our january 2009 restructuring and ii increased efforts to reduce controllable spending our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 117 in 2010 116 in 2009 and 110 in 2008 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

labor and related benefits  — in 2010 our labor and related benefits costs increased due primarily to i higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases ii higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by our growth initiatives iii additional bonus expense in 2010 because our performance against targets established by our annual incentive plans was stronger in 2010 compared with 2009 iv increased contract labor costs as a result of our current focus on optimizing our information technology systems v increased severance costs and vi higher noncash compensation costs incurred for equity awards granted under our longterm incentive plans during the second quarter of 2009 we reversed all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units based on a determination that it was no longer probable that the targets established for that award would be met additionally stock option equity awards granted during the first quarter of 2010 provide for continued vesting for three years following an employee’s retirement and because retirementeligible employees are not required to provide any future service to vest in these awards we recognized all of the compensation expense associated with their awards immediately we did not incur similar charges in prior years because this retirement provision was not included in any of the equity awards that were granted in 2009 or in 2008 

in 2009 our labor and related benefits costs decreased from 2008 because we realized benefits associated with our january 2009 restructuring our labor and related benefits expenses in 2009 were also affected by a significant decrease in noncash compensation costs associated with the equitybased compensation provided for by our longterm incentive plans as a result of i a decline in the grantdate fair value of our equity awards ii lower performance against established targets for certain awards than in the prior year and iii the reversal of all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units this decrease in noncash compensation costs was offset in part by higher costs associated with our salary deferral plan the costs of which are directly affected by equitymarket conditions additionally contract labor costs incurred for various corporate support functions were lower during 2009 than in 2008 

 

professional fees  — in 2010 our professional fees increased due to consulting fees driven primarily by improvements we are making to our information technology systems and our continued strategic focus to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings this increase was partially offset by a reduction in legal fees in 2010 

 

provision for bad debts  — our provision for bad debts was higher in 2009 and in 2008 as compared with 2010 as a result of the company’s assessment of the weak economic environment in those years and the resulting impacts on our collection risk however in the latter part of 2009 and during 2010 our collection risk moderated thus resulting in a lower provision in 2010 

 

other  — during 2010 we experienced increases in our i litigation reserves ii marketing and advertising costs due in part to our strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings and iii computer costs due in part to improvements we are making to our information technology systems 

 

in 2009 our focus on reducing controllable spending resulted in decreases in our advertising meetings seminars and travel and entertainment costs these lower costs were partially due to the january 2009 restructuring this decline was offset partially by unfavorable litigation settlements in 2009 

 

depreciation and amortization 

 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our companyspecific criteria for amortization purposes iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

the increase in amortization expense of landfill airspace in 2010 is largely due to adjustments to the amortization rates at various landfill sites these adjustments were principally attributable to increases in cost estimates the decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in 2009 is largely due to volume declines as a 

result of i the slowdown in the economy ii our pricing strategy and competition both of which significantly reduced our collection volumes and iii the redirection of waste to thirdparty disposal facilities in certain regions due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current capacity constraints of landfills where we are seeking an expansion permit the comparability of our amortization of landfill airspace for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 has also been affected by adjustments recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our capping closure and postclosure obligations during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 landfill amortization expense was reduced by 13 million 14 million and 3 million respectively for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with capping changes that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for capping activities ii effectively managing the cost of capping material and construction or iii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred capping costs 

 

the increase in amortization expense of intangible assets in 2010 is due to our focus on the growth and development of our business through acquisitions and other investments the current year increases are primarily related to the amortization of definitelived operating permits acquired by our healthcare solutions operations customer lists acquired by our southern and midwest groups and gas rights acquired by our renewable energy operations 

 

restructuring 

 

in january 2009 we took steps to further streamline our organization by i consolidating our market areas ii integrating the management of our recycling operations with our other solid waste business and iii realigning our corporate organization with this new structure in order to provide support functions more efficiently 

 

our principal operations are managed through our groups each of our four geographic groups had been further divided into 45 market areas as a result of our restructuring the market areas were consolidated into 25 areas we found that our larger market areas generally were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of scale that were not present in our smaller market areas and this reorganization has allowed us to lower costs and to continue to standardize processes and improve productivity in addition during the first quarter of 2009 responsibility for the oversight of daytoday recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities was transferred from our waste management recycle america or wmra organization to our four geographic groups by integrating the management of our recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste business we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers in addition as a result of this realignment we have significantly reduced the overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our business and have increased the geographic groups’ focus on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated basis 

 

this restructuring eliminated over 1500 employee positions throughout the company during 2009 we recognized 50 million of pretax charges associated with this restructuring of which 41 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized 

 

in 2010 we recognized 2 million of income related to the reversal of pretax restructuring charges 

income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 

 

income from divestitures  — the net gain from divestitures during 2008 was a result of our focus on selling underperforming businesses and primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our southern group 

 

asset impairments  — through december 31 2008 we capitalized 70 million of accumulated costs associated with the development of a new waste and recycling revenue management system a significant portion of these costs was specifically associated with the purchase of a license for waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use after a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of our smallest market areas the development efforts associated with the revenue management system were suspended in 2007 during 2009 we determined to enhance and improve our existing revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated with the development and implementation of the licensed software accordingly in 2009 we recognized a noncash charge of 51 million 49 million of which was recognized during the first quarter of 2009 and 2 million of which was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2009 for the abandonment of the licensed software 

 

we recognized an additional 32 million of impairment charges during 2009 27 million of which was recognized by our western group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair a landfill in california as a result of a change in our expectations for the future operations of the landfill the remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a charge required to write down certain of our investments in portable selfstorage operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those operations 

 

during 2008 we recognized a 4 million impairment charge primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our southern group 

 

other  — we filed a lawsuit in march 2008 related to the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009 in april 2010 we settled the lawsuit and received a onetime cash payment the settlement resulted in an increase in income from operations for the year ended december 31 2010 of 77 million 

income from operations by reportable segment 

 

the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

reportable segments — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic groups during the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 are summarized below 

 

  

the comparability of each of our geographic groups’ operating results for the periods was also affected by the restructuring charges recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 

 

other significant items affecting the comparability of our groups’ results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are summarized below 

 

eastern  — during 2009 the group recognized i an 18 million increase in revenues and income from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of our landfills and ii a 9 million charge related to bargaining unit employees in new jersey agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension fund 

 

during 2008 the group’s operating income was negatively affected by a 14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans 

 

midwest  — the income from operations of our midwest group for 2010 was significantly affected by the recognition of charges of 26 million as a result of employees of five bargaining units in michigan and ohio agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan 

the group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by 44 million of additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of a labor dispute in milwaukee wisconsin included in the labor dispute expenses were 32 million in charges related to the withdrawal of certain of the group’s bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans 

 

additionally when comparing the average exchange rate for 2010 with 2009 the canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10 which increased the group’s income from operations when comparing the average exchange rate for 2009 with 2008 the canadian exchange rate weakened by 7 which decreased the group’s income from operations the effects of foreign currency translation were the most significant to this group because substantially all of our canadian operations are managed by our midwest group 

 

southern  — additional volumes from oil spill cleanup activities along the gulf coast and lower repair and maintenance costs favorably impacted the group’s 2010 income from operations 

 

during 2008 the group’s operating income was favorably affected by 29 million of divestiture gains offset in part by a 3 million landfill impairment charge also favorably affecting the comparison of the group’s results in 2009 as compared with 2008 was the recognition of 9 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 resulting from changes in estimates associated with our obligations for landfill capping closure and postclosure similar favorable adjustments impacted the group’s results during 2010 

 

western  — the group’s 2010 income from operations includes 12 million of additional “selling general and administrative” expense recognized as a result of a litigation settlement 

 

the group’s 2009 income from operations includes the recognition of an impairment charge of 27 million as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of an inactive landfill in california 

 

further affecting the comparison of 2010 results with 2009 was the recognition of 7 million of favorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense during 2010 associated with our obligations for landfill capping closure and postclosure and a net 5 million of expense recognized for adjustments related to these obligations during 2009 the unfavorable adjustments during 2009 primarily related to a closed landfill in los angeles california for which the group recognized additional amortization expense the additional expense in 2009 did not affect the comparison to 2008 because during 2008 we recognized an unfavorable adjustment at the same landfill which was of a similar magnitude 

 

wheelabrator  — the decrease in the income from operations of our wheelabrator group for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 was driven by an increase in maintenancerelated outages as compared with the prior year which resulted in decreased electricity generation and increased plant maintenance costs these increases are attributable to the acceleration of repair and maintenance expenses at our facility in portsmouth virginia that we acquired in april 2010 and expenses at certain of our other facilities the group also experienced an increase in litigation settlement costs as compared with 2009 these unfavorable items were partially offset by the benefit of increased revenues from the sale of metals 

 

the comparability of the group’s 2009 income from operations with 2008 was significantly affected by i a decline in market prices for electricity which had a significant impact on the group’s results in 2009 due to the expiration of several longterm energy contracts and shortterm pricing arrangements ii an increase in costs for international and domestic business development activities and iii an increase in “operating” expenses of 11 million as a result of a significant increase in the property taxes assessed for one of our wastetoenergy facilities exposure to current electricity market prices increased from 24 of total electricity production in 2008 to 46 in 2009 

 

significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are summarized below 

 

other  — our “other” income from operations includes i the effects of those elements of our inplant services landfill gastoenergy operations and thirdparty subcontract and administration revenues managed by our upstream ®  renewable energy and strategic accounts organizations respectively that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments ii our recycling and electronic recycling brokerage services and iii the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings such as portable 

selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling in addition our “other” income from operations reflects the impacts of nonoperating entities that provide financial assurance and selfinsurance support for the groups or financing for our canadian operations and also includes certain yearend adjustments recorded in consolidation related to the reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment profit or loss used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed 

 

the slight improvement in operating results for our “other” businesses during 2010 as compared with 2009 is due to improvements in our recycling brokerage business as a result of higher recycling commodity prices this year largely offset by the unfavorable effects of i additional costs in the current year to support the company’s strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings and ii certain yearend adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed for 2010 the adjustments were primarily related to 15 million of additional expense recognized for litigation reserves and associated costs in the southern and wheelabrator groups 

 

the unfavorable change in 2009 operating results compared with 2008 is largely due to i the effect that the previously discussed lower recycling commodity prices had on our recycling brokerage activities ii an increase in costs incurred to support the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business iii the unfavorable impact lower energy prices during 2009 had on our landfillgastoenergy operations and iv certain yearend adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed 

 

corporate and other  — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

renewable energy operations 

 

we have extracted value from the waste streams we manage for years and we are focusing on increasing our ability to do so particularly in the field of clean and renewable energy most significantly our current operations produce renewable energy through the wastetoenergy facilities that are managed by our wheelabrator group and our landfill gastoenergy operations we are actively seeking opportunities to enhance our existing renewable 

energy service offerings to ensure that we can respond to the shifting demands of consumers and to ensure that we are acting as a leader in environmental stewardship 

 

we are disclosing the following supplemental information related to the operating results of our renewable energy operations for 2010 in millions because we believe that it provides information related to the significance of our current renewable energy operations the profitability of these operations and the costs we are incurring to develop these operations 

 

 

 

 

  

interest expense 

 

our interest expense was 473 million in 2010 426 million in 2009 and 455 million in 2008 when comparing 2010 with 2009 the significant increase in our interest expense is primarily due to i the issuance of an additional 600 million of senior notes in november 2009 to support acquisitions and investments made throughout 2010 ii significantly higher costs related to the execution and maintenance of our revolving credit facility which was refinanced in june 2010 and iii a decrease in benefits to interest expense provided by active interest rate swaps as a result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps outstanding these increases in interest expense were offset in part by a decline in market interest rates which has reduced the interest costs of our taxexempt borrowings and our canadian credit facility 

 

when comparing 2009 with 2008 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to declines in market interest rates which increased the benefits to interest expense provided by our active interest rate swap agreements and reduced the interest expense associated with our taxexempt bonds and our canadian credit facility 

 

interest income 

 

interest income was 4 million in 2010 13 million in 2009 and 19 million in 2008 the decreases in interest income are primarily related to a decline in market interest rates although our average cash and cash equivalents balances increased each year nearhistoric low shortterm interest rates have resulted in insignificant interest income being generated on current balances 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

 

during 2010 our “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties the equity losses generated by the limited liability company were more than offset by tax benefits realized as a result of this investment as discussed below in provision for income taxes refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our federal lowincome housing investment 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

we recorded provisions for income taxes of 629 million in 2010 413 million in 2009 and 669 million in 2008 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 385 281 and 372 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before income taxes ii the utilization of a capital loss carryback iii the realization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards iv changes in effective state and canadian statutory tax rates v tax audit settlements and vi the impact of federal lowincome housing tax credits the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

  

during 2010 our current state tax rate increased from 625 to 675 resulting in an increase to our provision for income taxes of 5 million in addition our state deferred income taxes increased 37 million to reflect the impact of changes in the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences will be realized during 2009 our current state tax rate increased from 60 to 625 and our deferred state tax rate increased from 55 to 575 resulting in an increase to our income taxes of 3 million and 6 million respectively during 2008 our current state tax rate increased from 55 to 60 resulting in an increase to our income taxes of 5 million the increases in these rates are primarily due to changes in state law the comparison of our effective state tax rate during the reported periods has also been affected by returntoaccrual adjustments which increased our “provision for income taxes” in 2010 and reduced our “provision for income taxes” in 2009 and 2008 

 

  

we expect our 2011 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 357 based on expected income levels and additional section 45 tax credits resulting from our investment in a refined coal facility specifically in january 2011 we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility the facility’s refinement processes qualify for federal tax credits which we expect to realize through 2019 in accordance with section 45 of the internal revenue code 

 

the small business jobs act signed into law in september 2010 contains a tax incentive package that includes a oneyear extension through 2010 of the 50 percent bonus or accelerated depreciation provision first enacted in 2008 and subsequently renewed in 2009 the provision had expired at the end of 2009 under the bonus depreciation provision 50 percent of the basis of qualified capital expenditures may be deducted in the year the 

property is placed in service and the remaining 50 percent deducted under normal depreciation rules the acceleration of deductions on 2010 capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provision had no impact on our effective tax rate however the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions did decrease our 2010 cash taxes by 60 million taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in future periods when the accelerated deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken 

 

in addition new tax law signed on december 17 2010 includes an extension of the bonus depreciation allowance through the end of 2011 and increases the amount of qualifying capital expenditures that can be depreciated immediately from 50 percent to 100 percent the 100 percent depreciation deduction applies to qualifying property placed in service between september 8 2010 and december 31 2011 the passage of the extension of bonus depreciation is estimated to decrease our 2011 cash taxes by approximately 190 million the cash tax benefit realized in 2011 will result in increased cash taxes in future periods when the deduction for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been realized 

 

noncontrolling interests 

 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 49 million in 2010 66 million in 2009 and 41 million in 2008 in each period these amounts have been principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator group however the comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has been affected by i our january 2010 acquisition of a controlling financial interest in a portable selfstorage business and ii the deconsolidation of certain capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation trusts as a result of our implementation of authoritative accounting guidance effective january 1 2010 associated with variable interest entities 

 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

 

we owned or operated 266 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2010 and we owned or operated 268 solid waste and five hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 and 2009 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 

 

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2010 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 40 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 33 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2010 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 50 

  

the tons received at our landfills in 2010 and 2009 are shown below tons in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2010 our closed sites management group managed 202 closed landfills 

 

landfill assets  — we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2010 and 2009 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2010 in millions 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2010 we estimate that we will spend approximately 400 million in 2011 and approximately 1 billion in 2012 and 2013 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to 

change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities  — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

 

the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2010 and 2009 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2010 in millions 

 

 

 

landfill costs and expenses  — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 

 

the comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds with a term approximating the weightedaverage period until settlement of the underlying obligations additionally in 2010 we increased our cost estimates associated with environmental remediation obligations primarily based on a review and evaluation of existing remediation projects as these remediation projects progressed more defined reclamation plans were developed resulting in an increase in remediation expense to reflect the more likely remedies 

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific capping event and are therefore amortized on a perton basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple perton amortization rates 

 

the following table calculates our landfill airspace amortization expense on a perton basis 

 

 

 

different perton amortization rates are applied at each of our 271 landfills and perton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a perton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear the comparability of our total company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our capping closure and postclosure obligations landfill amortization expense was reduced by 13 million in 2010 14 million in 2009 and 3 million in 2008 for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of capping events that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for capping activities ii effectively managing the cost of capping material and construction or iii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred capping costs 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and vii investments and acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments and share repurchases 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less the yearoveryear decrease in our cash balances is largely attributable to our november 2009 senior note issuance we used a significant portion of the proceeds of this debt issuance to fund investments and acquisitions during the first half of 2010 including i our acquisition of a wastetoenergy facility in portsmouth virginia for 150 million and ii our purchase of a 40 equity investment in seg a subsidiary of shanghai chengtou holding co ltd for 142 million pending application of the offering proceeds as described we temporarily invested the proceeds in money market funds which were reflected as cash equivalents in our december 31 2009 consolidated balance sheet 

 

restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of i funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations and ii funds received from the issuance of taxexempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or facilities these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

the decrease in capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation funds from december 31 2009 is due to our implementation of revised accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities effective january 1 2010 we were required to deconsolidate trusts for which power over significant activities is shared which reduced our restricted trust and escrow accounts by 109 million beginning in 2010 our interests in these variable interest entities were accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and receivables these amounts are recorded in “other receivables” and as longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheet 

 

the decrease in taxexempt bond funds is attributable to reimbursements distributed to us by the trust funds for approved construction and equipment expenditures and to a decrease in new taxexempt borrowings 

 

debt  — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2010 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 can primarily be attributed to i 908 million of cash borrowings including 592 million in net proceeds from the june 2010 issuance of 600 million of senior notes ii the cash repayment of 1112 million of outstanding borrowings at 

their scheduled maturities including the repayment of 600 million of senior notes in august 2010 and iii our investment in an entity that invests in and manages federal lowincome housing projects which increased our debt obligation by 215 million 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had i 502 million of debt maturing within twelve months including us212 million under our canadian credit facility and 147 million of 765 senior notes that mature in march 2011 and ii 405 million of fixedrate taxexempt borrowings subject to repricing within the next twelve months the amount reported as the current portion of longterm debt as of december 31 2010 excludes 674 million of these amounts because we have the intent and ability to refinance portions of our current maturities on a longterm basis 

 

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit in millions at december 31 categorized by type of facility 

 

 

 

 

  

the decrease in the utilization of the revolving credit facility and the increase in the utilization of our letter of credit and other facilities is due to the significantly higher costs associated with the 20 billion revolving credit facility that was executed in june 2010 

 

summary of cash flow activity 

 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below 

 

 55 

 

the comparison of our 2010 and 2009 income from operations was also affected by a 91 million increase in noncash charges attributable to i equitybased compensation expense ii interest accretion on landfill liabilities iii interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets iv depreciation and amortization and v the impact of the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multiemployer pension plans while the increase in noncash charges unfavorably affected our earnings comparison there is no impact on net cash provided by operating activities 

 

  

  

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below 

 

  

further approximately 55 million of the yearoveryear decrease in earnings is related to the impact of divestiture gains and gains on sale of assets for which the cash flow impacts are reflected in investing activities in the caption “proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets” 

 

the comparison of our 2009 and 2008 income from operations was also affected by an 86 million decrease in noncash charges attributable to i interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets ii equitybased compensation expense and iii interest accretion on landfill liabilities while the decrease in noncash charges favorably affected our earnings comparison there is no impact on net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 56 

  

  

net cash used in investing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

 57 

 

net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

  

we paid 501 million for share repurchases in 2010 compared with 226 million in 2009 and 410 million in 2008 we repurchased approximately 15 million 7 million and 12 million shares of our common stock in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decline in share repurchases during 2009 is largely attributable to the suspension of our share repurchases in july 2008 in connection with a proposed acquisition and to the state of the financial markets and the economy given the stabilization of the capital markets and economic conditions we elected to resume our share repurchases during the third quarter of 2009 

 

we paid an aggregate of 604 million in cash dividends during 2010 compared with 569 million in 2009 and 531 million in 2008 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 027 in 2008 to 029 in 2009 and to 0315 in 2010 and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs 

 

in december 2010 the board of directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be 034 per share for dividends declared in 2011 all 2011 share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management up to 575 million as approved by the board of directors in december 2010 and all actual future dividends must first be declared by the board of directors at its discretion with all decisions dependent on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future acquisitions and investments and other factors deemed relevant 

 

  

 

 

this summary excludes the impacts of noncash borrowings and debt repayments during the year ended december 31 2010 we had a 215 million noncash increase in our debt obligations as a result of the 

issuance of a note payable in return for a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage lowincome housing properties this investment is discussed in detail in note 9 for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 these noncash financing activities were primarily associated with our taxexempt bond financings proceeds from taxexempt bond issuances net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds were 105 million in 2009 and 169 million in 2008 

 

  

summary of contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

 

 

 

 59 

 

  

liquidity impacts of uncertain tax positions 

 

as discussed in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are primarily included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet because the company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2010 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

 

inflation 

 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of diesel fuel have affected our operating margins in recent years we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2010 over 35 of our collection revenues are generated under longterm agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  — in october 2009 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements became effective for the company on january 1 2011 the new accounting standard may be applied either retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption we do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

however our adoption of this guidance may significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future revenue arrangements to the extent they are material

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount as of december 31 2010 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 

interest rate exposure  — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs which are discussed in the financial assurance and insurance obligations section of item 1 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had 88 billion of longterm debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives discounts and premiums the effective interest rates of approximately 18 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2011 the most significant components of our variablerate debt obligations are i 500 million of “receive fixed pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixedrate senior notes ii 611 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process iii 405 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within twelve months and iv 215 million of outstanding advances under our canadian credit facility as of december 31 2009 the effective interest rates of approximately 30 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within twelve months 

 

the decrease in outstanding debt obligations exposed to variable interest rates in 2010 is generally a result of a 600 million decrease in the notional amount of active interest rate swaps and decreases in our variablerate taxexempt bonds the decline in our variablerate debt obligations has reduced the potential volatility to our operating results and cash flows that results from fluctuations in market interest rates we currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2011 interest expense by approximately 13 million 

 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our “fixedrate” tax exempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months in addition as of december 31 2010 we have forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 525 million the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately 658 million at december 31 2010 

 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

 

commodity price exposure  — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including aluminum old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets where we operate with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives which are discussed below we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended december 31 2010 alternatively we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues also increase or decrease 

 

during 2010 approximately 47 of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates and we currently expect that nearly 54 of our electricity revenues at our wastetoenergy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2011 our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased because several longterm power purchase agreements have expired the energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that medium and longterm electricity contracts are less favorable in the current environment as we renegotiate our powerpurchase agreements we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our wastetoenergy facilities and landfill gastoenergy plants will be based on current market rates accordingly in 2010 we implemented a more 

actively managed energy program which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives 

 

currency rate exposure  — from time to time we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives

we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america using our vast network of assets and employees we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services through our subsidiaries we provide collection transfer recycling disposal and wastetoenergy services in providing these services we actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment including recovering and processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities during 2009 our largest customer represented approximately 1 of annual revenues we employed approximately 43400 people as of december 31 2009 

 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our stockholders 

 

our primary strategy continues to be to improve our organization and maximize returns to shareholders by focusing on operational excellence pricing excellence and the profitable growth of our business we believe that creating more efficient operations and attracting and retaining customers while ensuring appropriate pricing are the steps that provide the foundation for growth we are continuing to focus on pricing and working to lower operating and selling general and administrative expenses through process standardization and productivity improvements we also are continuing programs designed to ensure we make the best use of our assets and capital to realize returns in addition to increasing our operating margins 

 

we intend to continue to focus on meeting the needs of a changing environment as the largest waste services provider in north america we believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  we believe that helping our customers achieve their environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth 

 

our focus on operational excellence has provided us a strong foundation on which to build we intend to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise and continue to seek profitable growth through targeted sales efforts and acquisitions we also continue to seek to grow our business in different areas that fit into our current operations we believe that making such investments will provide longterm value to our stockholders in addition we intend to continue to return value to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividend 

payments we recently announced that our board of directors expects that future quarterly dividend payments will be increased to 0315 per share in 2010 which is an 86 increase from the quarterly dividend we paid in 2009 this will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the seventh straight year which is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows all future dividend declarations will be made at the discretion of our board of directors 

 

operations 

 

general 

 

we manage and evaluate our principal operations through five groups our four geographic groups which include our eastern midwest southern and western groups provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services our fifth group is the wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services we also provide additional services that are not managed through our five groups as described below these operations are presented in this report as “other” 

 

the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our groups or reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2009 more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

 

 

the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wheelabrator wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

 

 

 

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station 

material recovery facility “mrf” or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2009 we owned or operated 268 solid waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are built and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are operated under prescribed procedures a landfill must be maintained to meet federal state or provincial and local regulations the operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes 

 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill we believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

 

we also operate five secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under federal environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

 

transfer at december 31 2009 we owned or operated 345 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

 

access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station 

 

wheelabrator as of december 31 2009 we owned or operated 16 wastetoenergy facilities and five independent power production plants or ipps which are located in the northeast and in florida california and washington 

 

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam as of december 31 2009 our wastetoenergy facilities were capable of processing up to 21100 tons of solid waste each day in 2009 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 70 million tons of solid waste or approximately 19200 tons per day 

 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

 

we generate steam at our wastetoenergy and ipp facilities for the production of electricity we sell the electricity produced at our facilities into wholesale markets which include investorowned utilities power marketers and regional power pools some of our facilities also sell steam directly to end users fees charged for electricity and steam at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps have generally been subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market conditions such as inflation electricity and other general market factors in 2009 several of our longterm energy contracts and shortterm pricing arrangements expired significantly increasing our wastetoenergy revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in market prices for electricity which generally correlate with fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets where we operate refer to the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report for additional information about the company’s current considerations related to the management of this market exposure 

 

recycling our recycling operations focus on improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs within communities and industries during the first quarter of 2009 we transferred responsibility for the oversight of daytoday recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our geographic groups before that all of our recycling operations other than certain services that were embedded within the geographic groups’ other operations had comprised and been reported as a separate segment the financial results of our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities are now included as a component of their respective geographic group and the financial results of our recycling brokerage business and electronics recycling services are included as part of our “other” operations we believe that integrating the management of our recycling facilities with the remainder of our solid waste business ensures that we are focusing on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of all aspects of our business and efficiently providing comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers 

 

in 2001 we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential singlestream recycling which allows customers to mix recyclable paper plastic and glass in one bin residential singlestream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates singlestream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies we have also been advancing the singlestream recycling programs for 

commercial applications recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

 

materials processing  — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our mrfs for processing we operate 90 mrfs where paper metals plastics glass and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale we also operate eight secondary processing facilities where recyclable materials can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods specifically material processing services include data destruction automated color sorting and construction and demolition processing 

 

plastics materials recycling  — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

 

commodities recycling  — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

 

fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of recyclable commodities being processed the volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

 

the recyclable materials processed in our mrfs are purchased from various sources including third parties and our own operations the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the finished goods to our customers to whom we sell the materials the price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of finished goods and market conditions but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or defined minimum perton rates as a result changes in commodity prices can significantly affect our revenues the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our operating income and margins 

 

other other services not managed within our groups include the following 

 

we provide recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services recycling brokerage includes managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties the experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with little to no capital requirements we also provide electronics recycling we recycle discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials in recent years we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “takeback” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner 

 

we provide sustainability services to businesses through our upstream ® and green squad organizations this includes inplant services where our employees work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and consulting services our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste the breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in identifying recycling opportunities minimizing waste and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal 

 

we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the epa endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2009 landfill gas beneficial use projects were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 119 of our solid waste landfills at 87 of these landfills the 

processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 23 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at nine landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

 

our wm healthcare solutions subsidiary offers integrated medical waste services for healthcare facilities pharmacies and individuals we provide fullservice solutions to facilities to assist them in best practices indentifying waste streams and proper disposal our healthcare services also include a sharps mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose of their used syringes and lancets using our medwaste tracker system 

 

although by their very nature many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services our national accounts program works with customers whose locations span the united states our national accounts program provides centralized customer service billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs 

 

we also have begun investing in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations these investments include joint ventures acquisitions and partial ownership interests the solutions and services include the development operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities operation of a landfill gastoliquid natural gas plant solar powered compact trash compactors and organic wastetofuel conversion technology part of our expansion of services includes offering portable selfstorage services and fluorescent bulb and universal waste mailback through our lamptracker ® program 

 

finally we rent and service portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  and provide street and parking lot sweeping services 

 

competition 

 

the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies private solid waste companies large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private wastetoenergy companies we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills 

 

operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of service we have also begun competing for business based on service offerings as companies individuals and communities have begun to look for ways to be more sustainable we are ensuring our customers know about our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of picking up and disposing of waste 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2009 we had approximately 43400 fulltime employees of which approximately 7300 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 9900 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

 

financial assurance 

 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits various forms of financial assurance also 

are required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure postclosure and remedial obligations at many of our landfills in addition certain of our taxexempt borrowings require us to hold funds in trust for the repayment of our interest and principal obligations 

 

we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

 8 

  

our 24 billion revolving credit facility becomes current in the third quarter of 2010 accordingly we will be working to renegotiate our existing facility in the nearterm we currently expect that the cost of a similar facility will be significantly higher than the cost of our existing facility in an effort to manage our financial assurance costs as well as ensure that we have access to facilities that meet our ongoing financial assurance needs we are currently evaluating options for alternative costeffective sources of financial assurance 

 

virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

insurance 

 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2009 our perincident deductible for our general liability program was 25 million and our perincident deductible for our workers’ compensation insurance program was 5 million as of december 31 2009 our auto liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 5 million subject to additional aggregate deductibles in the 5 million to 10 million layer of 48 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2009 are summarized in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

regulation 

 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us epa and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

 

because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

 10 

 

the epa has issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years 

 

  

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not otherwise preempted by federal law additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling 

 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretation of flow control legislation or the supreme court decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings 

cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements generally include statements containing 

 

  

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2010 and beyond 

 

general economic conditions can adversely affect our revenues and our operating margins 

 

our business is affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets although our services are of an essential nature a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues additionally consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers and our ability to increase customers’ pricing during weak economic conditions we may also be adversely impacted by customers’ inability to pay us in a timely manner if at all due to their financial difficulties which could include bankruptcies in addition to disruption in the credit markets economic conditions over the last eighteen months negatively affected business and consumer spending generally if our customers do not have access to capital we do not expect that our volumes will improve or that we will increase new business 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage 

 

in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts when this happens we may roll back prices or offer lower pricing to attract or retain our customers resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

 

if we do not successfully manage our costs or do not successfully implement our plans and strategies to improve margins our income from operations could be lower than expected 

 

in recent years we have implemented several profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our revenues 

 

we have implemented price increases and environmental fees both of which have increased our internal revenue growth and we have continued our fuel surcharge program to offset fuel costs the loss of volumes as a result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations we continue to seek to divest 

underperforming and nonstrategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability we may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and nonstrategic operations which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of lowmargin businesses if we are not able to fully or successfully implement our plans and strategies for any reason many of which are out of our control we may not see the expected improvements in our income from operations or our operating margins 

 

the seasonal nature of our business causes our quarterly results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes generally experienced by our southern group actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period 

 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety laws and cannot guarantee that they will not be material 

 

we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past and may in the future become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate 

 

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other “greenhouse gases” and their potential role in climate change the adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases including the imposition of fees or taxes could adversely affect our collection and disposal operations congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states which includes establishing capandtrade programs additionally the epa recently announced proposed regulations to control emissions of greenhouse gases from stationary sources including municipal solid waste landfills and several states have already begun taking actions to reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases depending on the form of legislation and regulations that are ultimately enacted our operating expenses could increase and some of our operations could be less profitable as we may be required to take any number of actions including the purchase of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution control technology 

 

significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

 

the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we have seen average quarterly fuel prices increase by as much as 56 on a yearoveryear basis and decrease by as much as 47 on a yearoveryear basis within the last two years we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any passthrough of the increased costs we may 

initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising costs of fuel although there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that such programs will be successful regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs the increased operating costs will decrease our operating margins 

 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorilyrequired levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby enabling us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to environmental closure and postclosure obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wmi financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations we currently do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future but general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit if we determine a development or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events 

 

we may be required to incur charges against earnings if we determine that events such as those described cause impairments any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard known as occ and old newsprint or onp the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash flows as we experienced in 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008 the monthly market prices for occ and onp fell by 79 

and 72 respectively from their high points within the year additionally the decline in market prices for commodities resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in revenue of 447 million in 2009 our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase and in some circumstances the rebates may have floors even as market prices decrease which could eliminate any expected profit margins 

 

there may be significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations the marketing and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and wastetoenergy operations are generally pursuant to longterm sales agreements therefore market volatility does not cause our quarterly results to fluctuate significantly however as longerterm agreements expire and are up for renewal or as market prices remain at lower levels for sustained periods our revenues will be adversely affected many of our longerterm agreements expired in 2009 and the electricity prices we were able to charge without the benefit of longterm agreements were tied to market electricity prices which generally correlate with fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets where we operate as a result we experienced a 76 million decline in revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared with the prior year additionally revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations if we are unable to successfully negotiate longterm contracts or depending on market conditions even with longterm contracts our revenues could be adversely affected 

 

the development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity 

 

our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting and others are working to reduce the waste they generate in addition some state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities although such mandates are a useful tool to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services our landfills and our wastetoenergy facilities currently provide and have historically provided our highest operating margins we have been expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to have the ability to service waste streams that do not go to landfills or wastetoenergy facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely however it is reasonably possible that our revenues and our operating margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives 

 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

 

labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income additionally it is possible that attempts to amend federal labor laws could be successful and make it easier for unions to become recognized as the bargaining representative for employees if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include 

adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

 

we may experience problems with either the operation of our current information technology systems or the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved we encountered problems with the revenue management application that we had been piloting throughout 2007 resulting in the termination of the pilot which has impeded our ability to realize improved operating margins as a result of a new system inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings 

 

additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods 

 

our capital requirements could increase our expenses or cause us to change our growth and development plans 

 

we currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments acquisitions and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary and available additional financings recent economic conditions have reduced our cash flows from operations and could do so in the future if impacts on our cash flows from operations are significant we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures acquisition activity dividend declarations or share repurchases we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities and there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income 

 

additionally we have 30 billion of debt as of december 31 2009 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next twelve months because of the combined impact of our taxexempt bonds our interest rate swap agreements and borrowings outstanding under our canadian credit facility therefore increases in interest rates can increase our interest expenses which also would lower our net income 

 

we may use our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2009 we had 822 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2009 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

2009 overview 

 

in our outlook for 2009 we communicated our belief that we would be well positioned to weather the challenges presented by the current economic environment we also noted that we would focus our efforts on ensuring we are operating efficiently and generating strong and consistent free cash flows when reviewing our 2009 financial results we believe that our focus throughout the year on i maintaining our pricing discipline ii controlling our costs and reducing discretionary spending and iii ensuring that our cost structure is flexible enough to respond to volume changes in a timely manner has enabled us to produce solid results in a difficult environment 

 

during 2009 our most significant challenges included i reduced volumes due to an overall decrease in waste produced that can be attributed to sharp declines in residential and commercial construction and in consumer and business spending ii an unusually weak recyclable commodities market for most of the year and iii decreases in market prices for electricity which affect the yield of our wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy operations against this backdrop we believe that our 2009 results of operations reflected the resilience of our core business and the opportunities that economic recovery will present for our more efficient organization the highlights of our 2009 financial results include 

 

  

in february 2009 we announced that we were consolidating our 45 market areas into 25 areas to further streamline our operations and throughout 2009 we incurred 50 million of restructuring costs related to these efforts the restructuring was a result of our continued efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations in 2009 we exceeded our expected cost savings of 120 million on an annualized basis due to the restructuring although one of our most significant focuses throughout 2009 was on controlling costs there are areas in which we have purposefully increased spending as we believe that the longterm benefits we will achieve outweigh their negative shortterm effect on our costs and margins these include professional fees related to expansion projects acquisitions and the growth of new business lines we also have not cut back on spending for information technology which we believe is imperative to enable our employees to perform efficiently 

 

liquidity and cash flow — although the credit markets came to an unprecedented standstill in late 2008 in february 2009 we were able to issue an aggregate of 800 million of senior notes the proceeds of this debt issuance were primarily used to refinance debt maturities which is generally consistent with our practice the state of the credit markets in late 2009 allowed us in large part because of our investment grade credit rating and strong balance sheet to issue an additional 600 million of 30year senior notes at an interest rate of 6125 we believe that the decision to raise capital on such favorable terms was a prudent decision and will increase our flexibility in 

pursuing acquisitions and investments in businesses when opportunities arise even with the increased indebtedness we are well within our debt to capitalization goals and all of our financial covenant requirements however the increased indebtedness is expected to increase our interest expense in 2010 

 

as is our practice we are presenting free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity we believe free cash flow gives investors insight into our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations however the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt maturities 

 

we calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below in millions which may not be the same as similarlytitled measures presented by other companies 

 

 

 

the decrease in our free cash flow in 2009 as compared with 2008 was due in large part to the decline in operating cash flows the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities can generally be attributed to the economy and market conditions the impacts of which are discussed in detail throughout the remainder of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  decreased proceeds from divestitures on a yearoveryear basis also contributed to the decline due in large part to us having fewer underperforming operations to sell 

 

our ability to generate over 12 billion in free cash flow in 2009 enabled us to return 795 million to stockholders during the year through the payment of 569 million in cash dividends and the repurchase of 226 million of our common stock 

 

basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information 

 

fair value measurements  — in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements this guidance defined fair value established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb delayed the effective date of the guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis accordingly we adopted this guidance for assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis effective january 1 2008 and adopted the guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis effective january 1 2009 the application of the fair value framework did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

business combinations  — in december 2007 the fasb issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated with business combinations this guidance clarified and revised the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree this guidance also addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements related to business combinations effective january 1 2009 we adopted the fasb’s revised guidance associated with business combinations the portions of this guidance that relate to business combinations completed before january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements further business combinations completed in 2009 which are discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements have not been material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows however to the extent that future business combinations are material our adoption of the fasb’s revised authoritative guidance associated with business combinations may significantly impact our 

accounting and reporting for future acquisitions principally as a result of i expanded requirements to value acquired assets liabilities and contingencies at their fair values when such amounts can be determined and ii the requirement that acquisitionrelated transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition 

 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  — in december 2007 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary the guidance also established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements we adopted this guidance on january 1 2009 the presentation and disclosure requirements of this guidance which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented have resulted in reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial information and the remeasurement of our 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates which are discussed in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements 

 

refer to note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position 

 

reclassification of segment information  — during the first quarter of 2009 we transferred responsibility for the oversight of daytoday recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our four geographic groups we believe that by integrating the management of our recycling facilities’ operations with the remainder of our solid waste business we can more efficiently provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers and ensure that we are focusing on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated basis as a result of this operational change we also changed the way we review the financial results of our geographic groups beginning in 2009 the financial results of our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities are included as a component of their respective geographic group and the financial results of our recycling brokerage business and electronics recycling services are included as part of our “other” operations we have reflected the impact of these changes for all periods presented to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our geographic group operations refer to note 21 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our reportable segments

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methods in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments and selfinsurance reserves and recoveries actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

landfills 

 

accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding i the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset ii the estimated fair value of capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities iii the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and iv the airspace associated with each final capping event 

 

landfill costs  — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and 

other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

 

final capping costs  — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

closure and postclosure costs  — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

remaining permitted airspace  — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

 

expansion airspace  — we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our field 

based engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 39 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2009 14 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace nine of these landfills required approval by our chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining five landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one or fiveyear requirements 

 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor or auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multi level review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

 

environmental remediation liabilities 

 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party or prp investigations settlements and certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions 

where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

asset impairments 

 

our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we review the carrying value of our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in order to assess whether a potential impairment exists the assets’ carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market environment for similar assets if the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable occurred these events or changes in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators 

 

there are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below 

 

landfills  — certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry 

 

goodwill  — at least annually we assess whether goodwill is impaired we assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value including goodwill we use a combination of two valuation methods a market approach and an income approach to estimate the fair value of our operating segments fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis however we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our operating segments 

 

the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publiclytraded companies with similar characteristics of our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows we then apply that multiple to our operating segment’s cash flows to estimate their fair value we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our operating segments 

the income approach is based on the longterm projected future cash flows of our operating segments we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weightedaverage cost of capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected longterm performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business 

 

additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that more likely than not the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired 

 

selfinsurance reserves and recoveries 

 

we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents differ significantly from our assumptions estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

 

results of operations 

 

operating revenues 

 

our operating revenues in 2009 were 118 billion compared with 134 billion in 2008 and 133 billion in 2007 we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western groups and our wheelabrator group which includes our wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants or ipps these five groups are our reportable segments shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our five groups and our other waste services 

 

 

 

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer recycling and wastetoenergy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and wastetoenergy operations revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the mrf or disposal facility and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for fuel our wastetoenergy revenues which are generated by our wheelabrator group are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam our “other” revenues include our inplant services landfill gastoenergy operations portolet ® services street and parking lot sweeping services portable selfstorage fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare solutions services 

intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements the mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 

 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

our revenues decreased 1597 million or 119 in 2009 as compared with 2008 a substantial portion of these declines can be attributed to market factors including i recyclable commodity prices ii lower fuel prices which reduced revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program iii the effect of lower electricity prices on our wastetoenergy business and iv foreign currency translation on revenues from our canadian operations 

 

in addition revenues continue to decline due to lower volumes which have resulted from the slowdown in the economy in 2009 economic pressures continued to significantly reduce consumer and business spending which meant less waste was being generated however our revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations was 323 million in 2009 which demonstrates our commitment to pricing even in the current economic environment 

 

towards the end of 2009 we began to see the trend of volume decline moderate for the fourth quarter of 2009 our revenue decline was 102 million or 33 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 this improvement as 

compared with our fullyear revenue decline of 119 is primarily driven by the steady commodity price recovery trend that occurred throughout 2009 as compared with the severe decline in commodity pricing and demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 additionally in the fourth quarter of 2009 we began to see our yearoveryear volume comparisons improve in our collection and disposal businesses 

 

the following provides further details associated with our periodtoperiod change in revenues 

 

average yield 

 

collection and disposal average yield  — this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer landfill and wastetoenergy disposal operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

 

in both 2009 and 2008 the increases in revenues from yield were driven by our collection operations which experienced substantial yield growth in all lines of business and in every geographic operating group primarily as a result of our continued focus on pricing initiatives including various fee increases as discussed below increased collection revenues due to pricing have been more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes however increased revenue growth from yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs has consistently provided margin improvements in our collection line of business in addition to the revenue growth from yield in the collection line of business we experienced increases in revenues from yield at our landfills and our transfer stations due to our continued focus on pricing activities 

 

revenues from our environmental fee which are included in average yield on collection and disposal increased by 37 million and 60 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively environmental fee revenues totaled 218 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with 181 million in 2008 and 121 million in 2007 

 

recycling commodities  — for the first nine months of 2008 record high commodity prices favorably impacted our revenue growth then during the fourth quarter of 2008 we saw a rapid decline in commodity prices due to a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and internationally commodity demand and prices continued to be weak in the first nine months of 2009 as compared with recordhigh commodity prices experienced through september of 2008 however market prices for recyclable commodities are recovering and prices have increased significantly from the record lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 while commodity prices are still significantly less than the levels seen in 2007 and the first nine months of 2008 the current price recovery trend contributed to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2009 and is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the coming year 

 

electricity  — the changes in revenue from yield provided by our wastetoenergy business are largely due to fluctuations in rates charged for electricity under our power purchase contracts that generally correlate with natural gas prices in the markets where we operate in 2009 we experienced a decline of 76 million in revenue from yield at our wastetoenergy facilities due to the falling electricity prices during 2009 approximately 34 of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates which is an increase from 18 during 2008 our wastetoenergy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility is increasing as more longterm contracts expire 

 

in 2008 we saw an increase of 24 million in revenue from yield provided by our wastetoenergy business this increase was largely due to annual rate increases for electricity under longterm contracts and favorable energy market pricing 

 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees — revenue generated by our fuel surcharge program decreased by 328 million and increased by 189 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the fluctuation is directly attributable to the fluctuation in the crude oil index prices we use for our fuel surcharge program 

the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the passthrough of fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above 

 

volume  — our collection business accounted for 622 million of the total volume decrease in 2009 our industrial collection operations experienced the most significant revenue declines due to lower volumes primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in both residential and commercial construction activities across the united states our commercial and residential collection lines of business tend to be more recession resistant than our other lines of business however we still experienced some commercial and residential collection volume declines in 2009 that we attribute to the recessionary economic environment as well as to pricing and competition 

 

in 2009 we also experienced a 16 decline in thirdparty revenue due to volume at our landfills this decrease was most significant in our more economically sensitive special waste and construction and demolition waste streams although municipal solid waste streams at our landfills have also decreased lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition lower volumes in our recycling operations caused declines in revenues of 74 million in 2009 these decreases are attributable to the drastic decline in the domestic and international demand for recyclables in late 2008 demand for recyclable commodities has recovered throughout 2009 although it has yet to compare favorably to the levels we experienced in advance of the market shift in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

in 2008 revenue declines due to lower volumes were driven by lower collection volumes and to a lesser extent lower transfer station and thirdparty disposal volumes declines in revenues from volumes in these lines of business were most significantly affected by i our focus on improving margins through increased pricing and ii economic conditions which particularly affected our industrial collection line of business revenue declines attributable to lower volumes also affected our recycling operations due to the rapid decline in demand for recyclable commodities experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

acquisitions and divestitures  — revenues increased 97 million and 117 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively due to acquisitions principally in the collection transfer and recycling businesses although we also made acquisitions starting in 2008 in our “other” business as we focused on entering new complementary lines of business divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of 37 million and 130 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively these divestitures were primarily comprised of collection operations and to a lesser extent transfer station and recycling operations beginning in the second quarter of 2008 revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded revenue declines from divestitures a trend we had not seen in over two years this change reflects our shift in focus from divesting underperforming operations to acquiring businesses 

 

operating expenses 

 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on asset retirement and environmental remediation obligations leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent and property taxes 

our operating expenses decreased by 1225 million or 145 when comparing 2009 with 2008 and increased 64 million or 08 when comparing 2008 with 2007 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 614 in 2009 632 in 2008 and 631 in 2007 the changes in our operating expenses during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 can largely be attributed to the following 

 

volume declines and divestitures — throughout 2009 and 2008 we experienced volume declines as a result of i the economy ii pricing and competition and iii divestitures we continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines and have achieved significant cost savings as a result these cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below 

 

changes in market prices for recyclable commodities  — market prices for recyclable commodities declined sharply when comparing 2009 with 2008 this significant decrease in market prices was the driver of the decrease in cost of goods sold during 2009 market prices for recyclable commodities climbed robustly through most of 2008 achieving levels during the first nine months of 2008 that had not been seen in several years however during the fourth quarter of 2008 the market prices and demand for recyclable commodities declined sharply the resulting nearhistoric low prices and reduced demand carried into the first quarter of 2009 and although prices have steadily increased during 2009 they remained significantly below prioryear levels throughout most of 2009 

 

fuel price changes  — lower market prices for fuel caused decreases in both our direct fuel costs and our subcontractor costs for the year ended december 31 2009 on average diesel fuel prices decreased 35 from 381 per gallon for 2008 to 246 per gallon for 2009 diesel fuel prices varied significantly in 2008 reaching a recordhigh price of 476 per gallon in july and falling to a threeyear low of 233 per gallon by the end of the year on average diesel fuel prices increased 32 in 2008 from 288 per gallon in 2007 to 381 per gallon 

 

changes in riskfree interest rates  — we recognized 35 million in favorable adjustments during 2009 compared with 33 million in unfavorable adjustments during 2008 and 8 million in unfavorable adjustments during 2007 due to changes in united states treasury rates which are used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets over the course of 2009 the discount rate we use increased from 225 to 375 during 2008 the discount rate we use declined from 400 to 225 during 2007 the discount rate we use declined from 475 to 400 these adjustments have been reflected in the landfill operating costs category in the table below 

 

canadian exchange rates  — when comparing the average exchange rate for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 the canadian exchange rate weakened by 7 which decreased our expenses in all operating cost categories the weakening of the canadian dollar decreased our total operating expenses by 40 million for 2009 as compared with 2008 changes in currency exchange rates had very little impact when comparing the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

acquisitions and growth initiatives  — in both 2009 and 2008 we have experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and to a lesser extent our various growth and business development initiatives these cost increases have affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

the periodtoperiod changes for each category of operating expenses are discussed below 

 

labor and related benefits — 

 

  

transfer and disposal costs — during 2009 and 2008 these cost decreases were a result of volume declines and our continued focus on reducing disposal costs associated with our thirdparty disposal volumes by improving internalization the 2009 decrease was also partially due to foreign currency translation 

 

maintenance and repairs — during 2009 these costs declined as a result of volume declines and various fleet initiatives that have favorably affected our maintenance parts and supplies costs these decreases have been offset partially by cost increases due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our wastetoenergy and landfill gastoenergy facilities 

 

subcontractor costs — during 2009 these cost decreases are a result of volume declines a significant decrease in diesel fuel prices and the effects of foreign currency translation 

 

cost of goods sold — the 2009 and 2008 cost changes are principally due to changes in the recycling commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result of changes in market prices for recyclable commodities discussed above and volume declines 

fuel — the cost changes for 2009 and 2008 are a result of changes in market prices for diesel fuel discussed above and volume declines 

 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes — these cost decreases are principally a result of volume declines although the comparability of the periods presented is also affected by the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our eastern group which reduced these expenses by 18 million during 2007 and 3 million during 2008 

 

landfill operating costs — the changes in this category for the years presented was primarily driven by the changes in us treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets the impacts of these rate changes are discussed above 

 

risk management — our consistent risk management costs reflect the success we have had over the last several years in managing these costs which can be primarily attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates for 2008 the decrease in expense was largely associated with reduced actuarial projections of workers’ compensation costs and reduced auto and general liability claims for current claim periods 

 

other — the comparison of these costs has been significantly affected by the following 

 

  

selling general and administrative 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

significant changes in our selling general and administrative expenses during the reported periods are as summarized below 

 

labor and related benefits  — in 2009 our labor and related benefits costs have declined because we have been realizing benefits associated with our january 2009 restructuring the comparability of our labor and related benefits expenses in 2009 has also been affected by a significant decrease in noncash compensation costs associated with the equitybased compensation provided for by our longterm incentive plans as a result of i a decline in the grantdate fair value of our equity awards ii lower performance against established targets for certain awards than in the 

prior year and iii the reversal of all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units based on a determination that it is no longer probable that the targets established for that award will be met this decrease in noncash compensation costs was offset in part by higher costs associated with our salary deferral plan the costs of which are directly affected by equitymarket conditions additionally contract labor costs incurred for various corporate support functions were lower during 2009 than in 2008 

 

the 2008 increase in labor and related benefits costs was primarily attributable to i higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases ii higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by an increase in the size of our sales force and our focus on our people and business development initiatives and iii higher noncash compensation costs associated with the equitybased compensation provided for by our longterm incentive plans additionally we also experienced higher insurance and benefit costs these increases were offset partially by lower bonus expenses accrued in 2008 because our performance against targets established by our incentive plan was not as strong as it had been in 2007 

 

professional fees  — in 2009 we experienced a slight decrease in professional fees due primarily to lower consulting fees related to our various strategic initiatives as compared with 2008 this decrease was largely offset by higher legal fees and expenses in 2009 

 

in 2008 our professional fees increased yearoveryear due to legal and consulting costs we incurred related to i the support of a proposed acquisition in 2008 and ii our business development initiatives these increases were partially offset by lower consulting costs in 2008 related to various strategic initiatives during 2007 including the support and development of the sap waste and recycling revenue management system which we discontinued development of in early 2008 

 

provision for bad debts  — the 3 million decline in our provision for bad debts in 2009 can be generally attributed to i the decrease in our revenues and accounts receivable due to current economic conditions and market factors and ii our continued focus on the management and collection of our receivables however in 2008 our provision for bad debts increased 8 million as the effects of the weakened economy increased collection risks associated with certain customers 

 

other  — during 2009 our costs associated with advertising meetings seminars and travel and entertainment declined as a result of our increased efforts to reduce controllable spending these lower costs were due in part to the recent restructuring this decline was offset partially by higher legal expenses in 2008 we were focusing on our sales marketing and other initiatives and identifying new customers which resulted in increases in our advertising costs and travel and entertainment 

 

depreciation and amortization 

 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded for capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

in both 2009 and 2008 the decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment is largely due to i components of enterprisewide software becoming fullydepreciated and ii our focus on retiring or selling underutilized assets 

 

the decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in 2009 and 2008 is largely due to volume declines as a result of i the slowdown in the economy ii our pricing program and competition both of which have significantly reduced our collection volumes and iii the redirection of waste to thirdparty disposal facilities in certain regions due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current capacity constraints of landfills where we are working on procuring an expansion permit the comparability of our amortization of landfill airspace for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 has also been affected by adjustments recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 landfill amortization expense was reduced by 14 million 3 million and 17 million respectively for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities ii effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction or iii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs 

 

restructuring 

 

in january 2009 we took steps to further streamline our organization by i consolidating our market areas ii integrating the management of our recycling operations with our other solid waste business and iii realigning our corporate organization with this new structure in order to provide support functions more efficiently 

 

our principal operations are managed through our groups each of our four geographic groups had been further divided into 45 market areas as a result of our restructuring the market areas were consolidated into 25 areas we found that our larger market areas generally were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of scale that were not present in our smaller market areas and this reorganization has allowed us to lower costs and to continue to standardize processes and improve productivity in addition during the first quarter of 2009 responsibility for the oversight of daytoday recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities was transferred from our waste management recycle america or wmra organization to our four geographic groups by integrating the management of our recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste business we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers in addition as a result of this realignment we have significantly reduced the overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our business and have increased the geographic groups’ focus on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated basis 

 

this restructuring eliminated over 1500 employee positions throughout the company during 2009 we recognized 50 million of pretax charges associated with this restructuring of which 41 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs the remaining charges were primarily related to lease obligations that we will continue to incur over the remaining lease term for certain operating lease agreements 

income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 

 

income expense from divestitures including heldforsale impairments  — the net gains from divestitures during 2008 and 2007 were a result of our focus on selling underperforming businesses in 2008 these gains were primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our southern group and in 2007 the gains were related to the divestiture of underperforming collection transfer and recycling operations in our eastern western and southern groups 

 

asset impairments excluding heldforsale impairments  — through december 31 2008 we had capitalized 70 million of accumulated costs associated with the development of our waste and recycling revenue management system a significant portion of these costs was specifically associated with the purchase of the license of sap’s waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use after a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of our smallest market areas the development efforts associated with the sap revenue management system were suspended in 2007 as disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in march 2008 we filed suit against sap and are currently scheduled for trial in may 2010 

 

during 2009 we determined to enhance and improve our existing revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated with the development and implementation of a revenue management system that would include the licensed sap software accordingly after careful consideration of the failures of the sap software we determined to abandon any alternative that would include the use of the sap software the determination to abandon the sap software as our revenue management system resulted in a noncash charge of 51 million 49 million of which was recognized during the first quarter of 2009 and 2 million of which was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

we recognized an additional 32 million of impairment charges during 2009 27 million of which was recognized by the west group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair a landfill in california as a result of a change in our expectations for the future operations of the landfill the remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a charge required to write down our investments in certain portable selfstorage operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those operations 

 

during 2008 we recognized a 4 million impairment charge primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our southern group during 2007 we recognized 12 million in impairment charges related to two landfills in our southern group the impairments were necessary as a result of the reevaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for the second landfill 

income from operations by reportable segment 

 

the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

reportable segments  — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic groups during the threeyear period ended december 31 2009 are summarized below 

 

  

the negative impact of these factors has been partially offset by the favorable effects of i increased revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal business as a result of our pricing strategies particularly in our collection operations and ii cost savings attributed to our january 2009 restructuring our continued focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies and our increased focus on reducing controllable selling general and administrative expenses particularly for travel and entertainment during 2009 

 

other significant items affecting the comparability of each groups’ results of operations for years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are summarized below 

 

eastern  — during 2009 the group recognized i an 18 million increase in revenues and income from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of our landfills and ii a 9 million charge related to bargaining unit employees in new jersey agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension fund during 2008 the group’s operating income was negatively affected by a 

14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans the group’s operating income for 2007 was favorably affected by i net divestiture gains of 33 million and ii an 18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter 

 

midwest  — during 2009 the group’s operating results were favorably affected by a 10 million reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to final capping closure and postclosure obligations the group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by 44 million of additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of a labor dispute in milwaukee wisconsin included in the labor dispute expenses are 32 million in charges related to the withdrawal of certain of the group’s bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans in addition the group experienced unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2008 

 

additionally when comparing the average exchange rate for 2009 with 2008 the canadian exchange rate weakened by 7 which decreased the group’s income from operations the effects of foreign currency translation were the most significant to this group because substantially all of our canadian operations are managed by our midwest organization changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparison of 2008 with 2007 

 

southern  — during 2008 the group’s operating income was favorably affected by 29 million of divestiture gains offset in part by a 3 million landfill impairment charge during 2007 the group recorded 12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of its landfills these charges were largely offset by gains on divestitures of 11 million 

 

western  — the group’s 2009 income from operations includes the recognition of an impairment charge of 27 million as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of a landfill in california which was offset in part by the recognition of a 6 million gain associated with the sale of water rights at a landfill during 2008 the group recognized a 6 million gain primarily related to the sale of surplus real estate in 2007 labor disputes negatively affected the group’s operating results by 37 million principally as a result of “operating” expenses incurred for security deployment and lodging costs for replacement workers gains on divestitures of operations were 16 million for 2007 

 

wheelabrator  — the comparability of the group’s 2009 income from operations with the prior years has been significantly affected by i a decline in market prices for electricity which had a more significant impact on the group’s results in 2009 due to the expiration of several longterm energy contracts and shortterm pricing arrangements ii an increase in costs for international and domestic business development activities and iii an increase in “operating” expenses of 11 million as a result of a significant increase in the property taxes assessed for one of our wastetoenergy facilities exposure to current electricity market prices increased from 18 of total electricity production in 2008 to 34 in 2009 the group’s exposure to current electricity market price volatility is expected to continue to grow to about 50 by the end of 2010 as several longterm contracts are set to expire next year the group’s 2008 operating results were favorably affected by increases in market rates for energy during the second half of 2008 while the group’s 2007 operating results were unfavorably affected by a 21 million charge for the early termination of a lease agreement the early termination was due to the group’s purchase of an independent power production plant that it had previously operated through a lease agreement 

 

significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are summarized below 

 

other  — the unfavorable change in 2009 operating results compared with 2008 is largely due to i the effect that the previously discussed lower recycling commodity prices had on our recycling brokerage activities ii an increase in costs being incurred to support the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business iii the unfavorable impact lower energy prices during 2009 had on our landfillgastoenergy operations and iv certain yearend adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed 

the unfavorable change in operating results in 2008 when compared with 2007 is the result of i the unfavorable effect that the previously discussed fourth quarter of 2008 sharp drop in recycling commodity prices had on our recycling brokerage activities and ii costs being incurred to support our increased focus on the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business 

 

corporate and other  — significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include 

 

  

interest income and expense — our interest expense was 426 million in 2009 455 million in 2008 and 521 million in 2007 interest income was 13 million in 2009 19 million in 2008 and 47 million in 2007 the decreases in interest income and expense for the periods presented are primarily attributable to significant declines in market interest rates 

 

interest expense  — lower market interest rates have increased the benefits to interest expense provided by our active interest rate swap agreements and reduced the interest expense associated with our taxexempt bonds and our canadian credit facility the impacts of each of these items on our interest expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are summarized below 

 

interest rate swaps  — we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates the impacts to interest expense of our interest rate swaps are primarily related to i net periodic settlements of current interest on our active interest rate swaps and ii the amortization of previously terminated interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense the following table summarizes the impact of periodic settlements of active swap agreements and the impact of terminated swap agreements on our results of operations in millions 

 

 

 

 

 41 

  

taxexempt bonds  — certain of our taxexempt bonds are subject to remarketing processes that result in periodic adjustments to the interest rates of the bonds as of december 31 2009 817 million of our taxexempt bonds are “variablerate” instruments and reprice on either a daily or weekly basis we also have taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that end before the bonds’ scheduled maturities and 387 million of these bonds were repriced during 2009 these remarketing processes have significantly reduced the weighted average interest rates of our taxexempt bonds which decreased from 45 at december 31 2007 to 40 at december 31 2008 and 34 at december 31 2009 

 

canadian credit facility  — borrowings outstanding under our canadian credit facility have shortterm maturities but are generally renewed at maturity under the terms of the facility which results in the effective interest rates of the borrowings being reset to reflect current market interest rates the weighted average interest rates of borrowings outstanding under our canadian credit facility have decreased from 53 as of december 31 2007 to 33 as of december 31 2008 and 13 at december 31 2009 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company issued an additional 600 million of senior notes which mature in 2039 and have a coupon rate of 6125 this debt issuance is expected to increase our average debt balances and our interest expense in 2010 as we currently expect to use the proceeds from the issuance to make various acquisitions and investments rather than as a source for the repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2009 the company’s debttototal capital ratio was 574 which continues to be consistent with our targeted longterm debttototal capitalization of up to 60 

 

interest income  — when comparing 2009 with 2008 the decrease in interest income is generally related to the decline in market interest rates offset in part by an increase in our cash and cash equivalents balances throughout the year as of december 31 2009 our cash and cash equivalents balances exceeded 1 billion due in large part to our 600 million issuance of senior notes during the fourth quarter 2009 we currently expect to utilize a significant portion of these funds for investments and acquisitions in the first half of 2010 including our anticipated purchase of a 40 equity investment in shanghai environment group which is discussed in note 11 of our consolidated financial statements and additional investments in our wastetoenergy and solid waste businesses 

 

when comparing 2008 with 2007 the decrease in interest income is primarily due to i significant declines in market interest rates ii the recognition of 7 million in interest income during the first quarter of 2007 for the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our eastern group and iii a decrease in our average cash and investment balances 

 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities — during 2007 our “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our equity interests in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the equity losses generated by the facilities were offset by the tax benefits realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for income taxes 

 

provision for income taxes — we recorded provisions for income taxes of 413 million in 2009 669 million in 2008 and 540 million in 2007 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 281 372 and 309 for each of the three years respectively at current income levels we expect that our 2010 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 38 the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 is primarily affected by i variations in our income before taxes ii the utilization of capital loss carryback iii the realization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards iv changes in effective 

state and canadian statutory tax rates v differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements and vi the impact of nonconventional fuel tax credits which expired at the end of 2007 the impacts of these items are summarized below 

 

  

noncontrolling interests — net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 66 million in 2009 41 million in 2008 and 46 million in 2007 in each period these amounts have been principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator group the profitability of one of the llcs has improved in 2009 as a result of an increase in the rentals paid by wheelabrator to the llc for the lease of one of the facilities we have consolidated these variable interest entities since 2003 because we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes we are in the process of reconsidering our consolidation of the llcs as a result of revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities additional information related to these investments is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has also been affected by significant adjustments recognized in consolidated operating expenses for changes in the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets as a result of changes in the us treasury rates used to measure these balances 

 

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

 

we owned or operated 268 solid waste and five hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2009 and we owned or operated 267 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2008 at december 31 2009 and 

2008 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 

 

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2009 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 35 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 39 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 41 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

 

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2009 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

 

 

 

 44 

 

the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

the tons received at our landfills in 2009 and 2008 are shown below in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 45 

 

  

when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency we generally transfer the management of the site including any remediation activities to our closed sites management group as of december 31 2009 our closed sites management group manages 201 closed landfills 

 

landfill assets  — we capitalize various costs that we incur to ready a landfill to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2009 and 2008 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2009 we estimate that we will spend approximately 500 million in 2010 and approximately 1 billion in 2011 and 2012 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities  — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2009 and 2008 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

landfill costs and expenses  — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 

 

the comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been most significantly affected by accounting for changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets which is based on the rate for us treasury bonds with a term approximating the weightedaverage period until settlement of the underlying obligations additionally in 2009 and 2008 our leachate collection costs were higher in certain of our geographic groups than they had been in 2007 primarily due to increased precipitation in the affected regions 

 

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a per ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a per ton basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple per ton amortization rates 

the following table calculates our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per ton basis 

 

 

 

different per ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 273 landfills and per ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company yearoveryear the comparability of our total company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations landfill amortization expense was reduced by 14 million in 2009 3 million in 2008 and 17 million in 2007 for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities ii effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction or iii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment iii construction refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills vi repaying debt and discharging other obligations and vii investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business 

summary of cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in us government obligations all of which have original maturities of three months or less the yearoveryear increase in our cash balances is largely attributable to our november 2009 senior note issuance which is discussed below we intend to use a significant portion of the proceeds of this debt issuance to fund investments and acquisitions during the first half of 2010 including our anticipated purchase of a 40 equity investment in shanghai environment group which is discussed in note 11 of our consolidated financial statements as well as additional investments in our wastetoenergy and solid waste businesses pending application of the offering proceeds as described we have temporarily invested the proceeds in money market funds which are reflected as cash equivalents in our december 31 2009 consolidated balance sheet 

 

restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of i funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations and ii funds received from the issuance of taxexempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or facilities these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

debt  — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2009 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 can primarily be attributed to i 1749 million of cash borrowings including 793 million in net proceeds from the february 2009 issuance of 800 million of senior notes and 592 million in net proceeds from the november 2009 issuance of 600 million of senior notes ii the cash repayment of 1335 million of outstanding borrowings iii proceeds from taxexempt borrowings of 130 million iv a 59 million decrease in the carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps v a 40 million increase in the carrying value of our debt due to foreign currency translation and vi the impacts of accounting for other noncash changes in our debt balances due to acquisitions interest accretion and capital leases 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had i 998 million of debt maturing within twelve months consisting primarily of us255 million under our canadian credit facility and 600 million of 7375 senior notes that mature in 

august 2010 and ii 767 million of fixedrate taxexempt borrowings subject to repricing within the next twelve months the amount reported as the current portion of longterm debt as of december 31 2009 excludes certain of these amounts because we have the intent and ability to refinance portions of our current maturities on a longterm basis refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to our classification of current maturities based on our intent and ability given the capacity available under our revolving credit facility and canadian credit facility to refinance certain of these borrowings on a longterm basis 

 

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit in millions at december 31 categorized by facility 

 

 

 

 

  

summary of cash flow activity 

 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below 

 

  

  

further approximately 55 million of the yearoveryear decrease in earnings is related to the impact of divestiture gains and gains on sale of assets for which the cash flow impacts are reflected in investing activities in the caption “proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets” 

 

the comparison of our 2009 and 2008 income from operations was also affected by an 86 million decrease in noncash charges attributable to i equitybased compensation expense ii interest accretion on landfill liabilities and iii interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities 

and recovery assets while the decrease in noncash charges favorably affected our earnings comparison there is no impact on net cash provided by operating activities 

 

  

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below 

 

 51 

 

  

net cash used in investing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

  

net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

  

we paid 226 million for share repurchases in 2009 compared with 410 million in 2008 and 1421 million in 2007 we repurchased approximately 7 million 12 million and 40 million shares of our common stock in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the significant declines in share repurchases for 2008 and 2009 are largely attributable to the suspension of our share repurchases in late 2008 given the state of the financial markets and the economy given the stabilization of the capital markets and economic conditions we elected to resume our share repurchases during the third quarter of 2009 

 

we paid an aggregate of 569 million in cash dividends during 2009 compared with 531 million in 2008 and 495 million in 2007 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 024 in 2007 to 027 in 2008 and to 029 in 2009 

 

in december 2009 the board of directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be 0315 per share for dividends declared in 2010 all future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and the board of directors will declare dividends at their discretion with any decisions dependent on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future acquisitions and investments and other factors the board may deem relevant 

  

 

 

this summary excludes the impacts of noncash borrowings and debt repayments for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 these noncash financing activities were primarily associated with our taxexempt bond financings proceeds from taxexempt bond issuances net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds were 105 million in 2009 169 million in 2008 and 144 million in 2007 

 

 53 

 

summary of contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

 

 

 

 54 

 

  

liquidity impacts of uncertain tax positions 

 

as discussed in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are primarily included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet because the company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2009 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

 

seasonal trends and inflation 

 

our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the traditional seasonal increase in the volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends although we saw a significantly weaker seasonal volume increase during 2009 than we generally experience 

 

additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes experienced by our southern group can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant mobilization costs such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of fuel have affected our operating margins in recent years we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however as of december 31 2009 approximately 35 of our collection revenues were generated under longterm franchise agreements with municipalities or similar local or regional authorities these contractual agreements generally provide for price adjustments based on various indicies intended to measure inflation additionally management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

consolidation of variable interest entities  — in june 2009 the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities this revised guidance replaces the current quantitativebased assessment for determining which enterprise has a controlling interest in a variable interest entity with an approach that is now primarily qualitative this qualitative approach focuses on identifying the enterprise that has i the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity this revised guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than a reassessment only upon 

the occurrence of specific events the new fasbissued authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities is effective for the company january 1 2010 the change in accounting may either be applied by recognizing a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings on the date of adoption or by retrospectively restating one or more years and recognizing a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest year restated we are currently in the process of assessing the provisions of this revised guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  — in september 2009 the fasb amended authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables the amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multipledeliverable revenue arrangements are effective for the company january 1 2011 although the fasb does permit early adoption of the guidance provided that it is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption the new accounting standard may be applied either retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption we are in the process of assessing the provisions of this new guidance and currently do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however our adoption of this guidance may significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future revenue arrangements to the extent they are material

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount as of december 31 2009 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 

 

interest rate exposure  — our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs which are discussed in the financial assurance and insurance obligations section of item 1 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had 88 billion of longterm debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives discounts and premiums the effective interest rates of approximately 30 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2010 the most significant components of our variablerate debt obligations are i 11 billion of “receive fixed pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixedrate senior notes ii 817 million of taxexempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process iii 767 million of taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within twelve months and iv 257 million of outstanding advances under our canadian credit facility as of december 31 2008 the effective interest rates of approximately 34 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was subject to change within twelve months 

 

the decrease in outstanding debt obligations exposed to variable interest rates in 2009 is generally as a result of an 850 million decrease in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps offset in part by an increase in the portion of our outstanding taxexempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within twelve months the decline in our variablerate debt obligations has reduced the potential volatility to our operating results and cash flows that results from fluctuations in market interest rates we currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variablerate debt obligations would increase our 2010 interest expense by approximately 23 million 

 

our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or for certain of our “fixedrate” tax exempt bonds through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months in addition as of december 31 2009 we have treasury rate locks with a notional amount 

of 200 million and forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 525 million the fair value of our fixedrate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change 

 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risksensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately 610 million at december 31 2009 

 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts these assets are generally invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in us government obligations with original maturities of three months or less because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

 

commodity price exposure — in the normal course of our business we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel recyclable materials including aluminum old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint and electricity which generally correlates with natural gas prices in the markets where we operate during the three years ended december 31 2009 we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities alternatively we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided accordingly as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease our revenues also increase or decrease 

 

during 2009 approximately 34 of the electricity revenue at our wastetoenergy facilities was subject to current market rates and we currently expect that nearly 50 of our electricity revenues at our wastetoenergy facilities will be at market rates in 2010 our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased because several longterm power purchase agreements have expired the energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that medium and longterm electricity contracts are less favorable in the current environment as we renegotiate our powerpurchase agreements we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our wastetoenergy facilities and landfill gastoenergy plants will be based on current market rates accordingly in 2010 we will be implementing a more actively managed energy program which will include a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity 

 

currency rate exposure  — from time to time we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company

general 

 

the financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary waste management inc is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wmi” we are referring only to the parent holding company 

 

wmi was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wmi and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wmi wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries for detail on the financial position results of operations and cash flows of wmi wm holdings and their subsidiaries see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street suite 4000 houston texas 77002 our telephone number at that address is 713 5126200 our website address is httpwwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wmi” 

 

we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america using our vast network of assets and employees we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services through our subsidiaries we provide collection transfer recycling disposal and wastetoenergy services in providing these services we actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment including recovering and processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities during 2008 no single customer accounted for more than 1 of our operating revenue we employed approximately 45900 people as of december 31 2008 

 

strategy 

 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving five key stakeholders our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our shareholders our goals are 

 

  

our primary strategy is to improve our organization and maximize returns to shareholders by focusing on operational excellence pricing excellence and the profitable growth of our business although current economic conditions are presenting challenges to us and others we believe that continuously working to create more efficient operations and to attract and retain customers while raising prices are the steps that will allow us to weather the current environment we continue our efforts toward revenue growth through pricing and differentiating our services to retain our customers additionally we are working to lower operating and selling general and administrative expenses through process standardization and productivity improvements we do not have control over the general economic conditions that are affecting consumers and businesses including ours however we do 

have the ability to react to a changing environment and proactively take steps to reduce the impact that current conditions may have on our operations 

 

in february 2009 we announced that we were taking steps to further streamline our organization by consolidating many of our market areas our principal operations are managed through six groups as described below each of our geographic groups had been further divided into several market areas as a result of our restructuring the 45 separate market areas that we previously operated have been consolidated into 25 areas management at this level of the organization is responsible for selling and marketing our services and coordinating all of our operations within the market in addition they implement marketbased strategies and plans and provide staff support in administration financial control and analysis human resources customer service pricing and business strategy safety fleet services and community and municipal relations we have found that our larger market areas generally were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of scale that were not present in the smaller market areas we have also realigned our corporate organization with this new structure in order to provide these support functions more efficiently we currently estimate that this restructuring will eliminate over 1000 employee positions throughout the company and result in a restructuring charge of between 40 million and 50 million we expect to recognize most of this charge during the first quarter of 2009 this realignment is the natural next step in our efforts to lower costs and further standardize processes and improve productivity and we currently estimate that it will provide annualized cost savings in excess of 100 million 

 

we intend to continue building on our strategy to meet the needs of a changing environment as the largest waste services provider in north america we believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they too think green ®  we believe that helping our customers achieve their environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth we regularly help customers reduce reuse and recycle the waste they produce we also focus on ways to convert waste to a usable energy source by focusing on providing new environmentally responsible and sustainable solutions to our customers’ waste problems we believe we can create a competitive advantage across all of our lines of business 

 

our focus on operational excellence has provided us a strong foundation on which to build we intend to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise and continue to seek profitable growth through targeted sales efforts and acquisitions we also continue to seek to grow our current business in different areas that fit into our current operations we believe that even in these challenging economic times we can make investments that will provide longterm value to our stockholders 

 

operations 

 

general 

 

we currently manage and evaluate our principal operations through six operating groups of which four are organized by geographic area and two are organized by function the geographic groups include our eastern midwest southern and western groups and the two functional groups are our wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services and our wm recycle america “wmra” group which provides recycling services not managed by our geographic groups we also provide additional waste management services that are not managed through our six groups these services include inplant services where we work at our clients’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions and provide opportunities for process improvements and associated cost reductions in their waste management other services not managed within our groups include methane gas recovery subcontracted and administrative services performed by our national accounts and upstream organizations portable selfstorage fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare solutions services including medical waste disposal these services are presented in this report as “other” 

 

the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2008 more information about our results of operations by reportable 

segment is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

 

 

the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wheelabrator wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

 

 

 

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to a transfer station or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

 3 

 

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america at december 31 2008 we owned or operated 267 solid waste landfills which represents the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are built and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are operated under prescribed procedures a landfill must be maintained to meet federal state or provincial and local regulations the operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes 

 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill we believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

 

we also operate six secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under federal environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

 

transfer at december 31 2008 we owned or operated 355 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

 

access to transfer stations is often critical to thirdparty haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in close proximity to their collection operations fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own are generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for the regulatory requirements relating to the operation closure and post closure of the transfer station 

 

wheelabrator as of december 31 2008 we owned or operated 16 wastetoenergy facilities and five independent power production plants or ipps which are located in the northeast and in florida california and washington 

 

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam as of december 31 2008 our wastetoenergy facilities 

were capable of processing up to 21100 tons of solid waste each day in 2008 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 70 million tons of solid waste or approximately 19200 tons per day 

 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

 

we sell the steam produced at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps to industrial and commercial users steam that is not sold is used to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities fees charged for steam and electricity at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps are generally subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market conditions such as inflation natural gas prices and other general market factors 

 

recycling our wmra group focuses on improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs within communities and industries in addition to our wmra group our four geographic operating groups provide certain recycling services that are embedded within the groups’ other operations and therefore are not included within the wmra group’s financial results 

 

recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

 

collection and materials processing  — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our material recovery facilities “mrfs” for processing we operate 98 mrfs where paper metals and plastics are recovered for resale we also operate six secondary processing facilities where materials received from mrfs can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods specifically material processing services include data destruction automated color sorting and construction and demolition processing 

 

plastics and rubber materials recycling  — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic and rubber commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

 

electronics recycling services  — we recycle discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials 

 

commodities recycling  — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities for our own facilities and for third parties by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

 

fees for recycling services are influenced by frequency of collection type and volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

 

our wmra group purchases recyclable materials processed in our mrfs from various sources including third parties and other operating subsidiaries of wmi the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the finished goods to our customers the price our wmra group pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” rebates are generally based upon the price we receive for sales of finished goods and market conditions but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or defined minimum perton rates as a result changes in commodity prices can significantly affect our revenues the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our operating income and margins 

 

other we provide inplant services in which employees of our upstream organization work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions our vertically integrated waste 

management operations allow us to provide customers with full management of their waste including identifying recycling opportunities minimizing waste and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal 

 

we also develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the united states environmental protection agency endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2008 landfill gas beneficial use projects were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 111 of our solid waste landfills at 80 of these landfills the processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 23 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at eight landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

 

in addition we rent and service portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  and provide street and parking lot sweeping services we also have begun providing portable selfstorage fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare solutions services from time to time we are also contracted to construct waste facilities on behalf of third parties 

 

competition 

 

the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies private solid waste companies large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private wastetoenergy companies we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills the municipalities and regional governmental authorities are often able to offer lower direct charges to customers for the same service by subsidizing their costs through the use of tax revenues and taxexempt financing generally however municipalities do not provide significant commercial and industrial collection or waste disposal 

 

we compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other companies own or operate their own landfills to which they will send their waste we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and quality of services operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition based on pricing and quality of service our customer service contracts limit our ability to implement certain price increases and pass through some of our increased costs from time to time competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2008 we had approximately 45900 fulltime employees of which approximately 8000 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 11000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

 

financial assurance 

 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits various forms of financial assurance are 

also required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure postclosure and remedial obligations at many of our landfills in addition certain of our taxexempt borrowings require us to hold funds in trust for the repayment of our interest and principal obligations 

 

we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

 7 

  

  

the assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established other than these permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

 

insurance 

 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy as of december 31 2008 our perincident deductible for our general liability program was 25 million and our perincident deductible for our workers’ compensation insurance program was 5 million as of december 31 2008 our auto liability insurance program included a perincident base deductible of 1 million subject to additional aggregate deductibles in the 1 million to 5 million layer and the 5 million to 10 million layer of 24 million and 25 million respectively effective january 1 2009 we increased the perincident base deductible of our auto liability insurance program to 5 million subject to an additional aggregate deductible in the 5 million to 10 million range of 48 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2008 are summarized in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

regulation 

 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the us epa and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

 

because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to renewal modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

 9 

 

the epa has issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years 

 

  

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not otherwise preempted by federal law additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling 

 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretation of flow control legislation or the supreme court decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services 

 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in an effort to keep our shareholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements generally include statements containing 

 

  

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2009 and beyond 

 

general economic conditions can adversely affect our revenues and our operating margins 

 

our business is affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control including consumer confidence interest rates and access to capital markets although our services are of an essential nature a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues additionally consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers and our ability to increase customers’ pricing during weak economic conditions we may also be adversely impacted by customers’ inability to pay us in a timely manner if at all due to their financial difficulties which could include bankruptcies the availability of credit in the second half of 2008 was severely limited which negatively affected business and consumer spending generally if our customers do not have access to capital we do not expect that our volumes will improve or that we will increase new business 

 

we have 28 billion of debt as of december 31 2008 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the combined impact of our variable rate taxexempt bonds and our interest rate swap agreements therefore any increase in interest rates can significantly increase our interest expenses additionally the unavailability of credit on favorable terms can adversely impact our growth development and capital spending plans 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists of two national waste management companies regional companies and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage 

 

in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts when this happens we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or retain our customers resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

if we do not successfully manage our costs or do not successfully implement our plans and strategies to improve margins our income from operations could be lower than expected 

 

in recent years we have implemented several profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our revenues 

 

we have implemented price increases and environmental fees and we have continued our fuel surcharge program all of which have increased our internal revenue growth the loss of volumes as a result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations we continue to seek to divest underperforming and nonstrategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability we may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and nonstrategic operations which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of lowmargin businesses additionally in february 2009 we announced that we had taken steps to realign our field operations to combine several of our market areas in an effort to achieve greater economies of scale in our local and regional operations and our corporate organization to provide support functions more efficiently if we are not able to fully or successfully implement our plans and strategies for any reason many of which are out of our control we may not see the expected improvements in our income from operations or our operating margins 

 

the seasonal nature of our business causes our quarterly results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes generally experienced by our southern group actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

for these and other reasons operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period 

 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety laws and cannot guarantee that they will not be material 

 

we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past and may in the future become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

 12 

 

  

we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

 

governmental authorities may enact climate change regulations that could increase our costs to operate 

 

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change the adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases including the imposition of fees or taxes could adversely affect our collection and disposal operations additionally certain of the states in which we operate are contemplating air pollution control regulations that are more stringent than existing and proposed federal regulations changing environmental regulations could require us to take any number of actions including the purchase of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution control technology and could make some operations less profitable which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

 

the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns we have seen average quarterly fuel prices increase by as much as 56 on a yearoveryear basis and decrease by as much as 9 on a yearoveryear basis within the last two years we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses 

increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs we may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising costs of fuel although there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that such programs will be successful regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs the increased operating costs will decrease our operating margins 

 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby allowing us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to environmental closure and postclosure obligations we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wmi financial guarantees we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations we do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future although general economic factors may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments additionally in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

 

we may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects events that could in some circumstances lead to an impairment include but are not limited to shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit if we determine a development or expansion project is impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which is required to be assessed for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events the recent downturn in the recycling commodities market could potentially cause the carrying value of wmra’s assets to be lower than their fair value resulting in an impairment to goodwill 

 

we may be required to incur charges against earnings if we determine that events such as those described cause impairments any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for 

sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard known as occ and old newsprint or onp the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash flows as we experienced in 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008 the monthly market prices for occ and onp fell by 79 and 72 respectively from their high points within the year the decline in market prices for commodities resulted in a fourth quarter 2008 yearoveryear decrease in revenue of almost 100 million additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase and in some circumstances the rebates may have floors even as market prices decrease which could eliminate any expected profit margins 

 

additionally there may be significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energy related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations the marketing and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and wastetoenergy operations are generally pursuant to longterm sales agreements therefore market volatility does not cause our quarterly results to fluctuate significantly however as longerterm agreements expire and are up for renewal or as market prices remain at lower levels for sustained periods our revenues will be adversely affected additionally revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly electricity prices have ranged from increases of as much as 26 to decreases of as much as 5 

 

the development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity 

 

our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting in addition some state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities although such mandates are a useful tool to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services 

 

our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions 

 

labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income considerable attention has been focused on proposed legislation that could amend the national labor relations act that would make it easier for unions to become recognized as the bargaining representative for employees depending on the form of legislation if any that is ultimately enacted it is reasonably possible that our operating expenses would increase as a result of the provisions of such legislation if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements or future legislation requires us to submit the terms of employment to binding arbitration in the event an agreement cannot be reached in a timely manner our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages including strikes or unfavorable terms in agreements that result from arbitration any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

 

we may experience problems with either the operation of our current information technology systems or the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved we encountered problems with the revenue management application that we had been piloting throughout 2007 resulting in the termination of the pilot which has impeded our ability to realize improved operating margins as a result of a new system inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings there can be no assurances that our issues related to the licensed application will not ultimately result in an impairment charge which could be material 

 

additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods 

 

unforeseen circumstances could result in a need for additional capital 

 

we currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments acquisitions and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary and available additional financings however materially adverse events including recent economic conditions may reduce our cash flows from operations our board of directors has approved a capital allocation program for 2009 that provides for up to 13 billion in aggregate dividend payments share repurchases acquisitions and debt reductions in december 2008 we announced that we expect future quarterly dividend payments when declared by the board of directors to be 029 per share if the impact on our cash flows from operations is significant we may need to reduce capital expenditures acquisition activity or dividend declarations unless we are able to incur indebtedness to either pay for these activities or refinance our scheduled debt maturities in light of the recent state of the credit markets there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable terms in these circumstances we would likely use our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2008 we had 297 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility 

 

in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december 31 2008 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

in 2008 we saw significant changes in the environment in which we operate including severe economic uncertainty increasing market volatility and continued tightening of credit markets as well as a merger of two of the largest industry competitors the market conditions in 2008 contributed to record high fuel and commodity prices during most of the year and nearly unprecedented drops in these commodity prices in the second half of the year we often note that we are a recession resilient industry but in challenging economic times reduced consumer and business spending means less waste is being produced additionally businesses across the country are experiencing slower demands for their products and services and a tightening of the credit markets which makes it more difficult for many of our customers to pay their bills leading to decreases in the services they request and in some cases cancelling our services all together 

 

against this backdrop we believe that our results of operations show just how successful we have been in improving our business the highlights in 2008 include 

 

  

  

  

  

we experienced revenue increases during each of the first three quarters of 2008 as compared with 2007 followed by a significant decline in revenues in the fourth quarter caused primarily by the effect of the recycling commodities markets and the decrease in revenues from our fuel surcharge program our pricing program which focuses on ensuring that we receive appropriate pricing for all of our services continued to provide significant increases in our revenues from base business yield during 2008 reflecting our commitment to pricing discipline 

despite the economic environment we are committed to our pricing excellence program and do not intend to take volumes at prices that do not cover our costs and provide strong operating margins 

 

our operating costs increased by 64 million or less than one percent in 2008 as compared with 2007 the largest contributors to the increase were the result of conditions discussed above the negative effect of these cost increases was offset in part by benefits from our focus on operating efficiencies managing fixed costs and reducing variable costs as our volumes decline due to i the slowdown in the economy ii our pricing program and iii divestitures 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses increased by 45 million or 31 in 2008 as compared with 2007 the increase is largely attributable to increased labor costs as a result of merit increases headcount increases higher compensation costs associated with our equitybased compensation program for our senior employees and higher insurance and benefit costs we have also seen an increase in bad debt expense as a result of the weakened economy finally we have incurred significant costs for our business development initiatives which are focused on gaining new customers and entering new lines of business that are complementary to our core operations these are costs that we believe are necessary to position waste management as a leading environmental solutions provider 

 

as is our practice we are including free cash flow which is a nongaap measure of liquidity in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business we also believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase common stock fund acquisitions and other investments and in the absence of refinancings to repay our debt obligations free cash flow is not intended to replace “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable gaap measure however we believe free cash flow gives investors greater insight into how we view our liquidity nonetheless the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements 

 

we calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below in millions which may not be the same as similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

 

 

our free cash flow in 2008 exceeded the 14 billion we targeted for the year which we believe is indicative of our continued ability to generate strong cash flow from our operations even in a challenging economic environment the decrease in our free cash flow when comparing 2008 with 2007 is due to decreased proceeds from divestitures which is largely a result of having fewer underperforming operations to sell as part of our fixorseekexit initiative offset in large part by growth in our net cash provided by operating activities 

 

outlook 

 

in 2008 we experienced challenges associated with changing market conditions which caused significant volatility in fuel and recyclable commodity prices and the tightening of the economy which has put negative pressure on both consumer and business spending resulting in less consumption and waste produced however we are encouraged that our 2008 results demonstrate that the cornerstones of our business are resilient in a difficult economic environment we believe we are well positioned to weather the current economic downturn in 2009 we will focus on i ensuring that we are operating efficiently and ii generating strong and consistent free cash flow 

 

in february 2009 we announced that we are taking steps to further streamline our organization by consolidating many of our market areas as a result of our restructuring the 45 separate market areas that we previously operated have been consolidated into 25 areas we currently estimate that this restructuring will eliminate over 

1000 employee positions throughout the company and result in a restructuring charge of between 40 million and 50 million we expect to recognize most of this charge during the first quarter of 2009 this realignment is the next step in our efforts to lower costs and further standardize processes and improve productivity and we currently estimate that it will provide annualized cost savings in excess of 100 million 

 

although we expect that our net cash provided by operating activities may be negatively affected by general economic conditions we believe that we will continue to generate strong cash flow from operations which along with our available cash will provide sufficient liquidity to allow us to return value to our shareholders our 2009 capital allocation program provides for up to 13 billion in aggregate dividend payments share repurchases acquisitions and debt reductions in 2009 we have significant debt repayment obligations and while we currently intend to refinance a significant portion of the required repayments on a longterm basis it is possible that we may not have access to the credit markets on acceptable terms if the credit markets are not available to us or are not available on terms we deem acceptable we expect to rely on our available cash our existing credit facility and the cash we generate from our operations to meet our debt repayment and other obligations our discretionary spending includes acquisitions of assets and businesses dividends repurchases of our common stock and certain capital expenditures to the extent operating cash flows decline or are needed to support our debt repayment obligations we have the ability to reduce our discretionary spending and still deliver superior service to our customers and a strong financial performance for our stockholders 

 

over the years the recyclables that we process have been subject to significant market price fluctuations and in the first three quarters of 2008 increases in the prices of recycling commodities contributed to our revenue growth margin expansion and earnings however our fourth quarter 2008 operating results reflect the significant dislocation in the commodities markets including substantial reductions in demand both domestically and internationally in this environment we have experienced sharp declines in commodity prices and a degree of difficulty in selling recyclable commodities including at contractually defined prices we currently expect this market downturn to reduce our revenues and negatively affect our earnings and operating cash flows in 2009 further a sustained period of depressed commodity prices andor demand for recyclables could result in a significant decline in the estimated fair value of wmra which could require us to record a noncash impairment charge to their goodwill 

 

as discussed in our overview  the cost of fuel also fell significantly in the second half of 2008 we do not expect future volatility in fuel prices to significantly affect our income from operations however we do expect the sharp decline in fuel prices to significantly reduce i the revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program and ii our direct and indirect fuel costs in 2009 as compared with 2008 

 

technology update — on march 20 2008 we filed a lawsuit in state court in the southern district of texas against sap ag and sap america inc alleging fraud and breach of contract the lawsuit relates to our 2005 software license from sap for a waste and recycling revenue management system and agreement for sap to implement the software on a fixedfee basis we have been assigned a trial date in october 2009 as we continue to assess the alternatives available to us we may determine that the best course of action is to abandon the sap revenue management system which would result in an impairment charge of between 45 million and 55 million 

 

basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information 

 

accounting changes — effective january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 for assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis our adoption of sfas no 157 during the first quarter of 2008 resulted in the recognition of a 6 million charge to operating expenses and a corresponding 3 million credit to minority interest expense for the remeasurement of the fair value of environmental remediation recovery assets accounted for in accordance with statement of position no 961 environmental remediation liabilities the adoption of sfas no 157 did not materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 17 for information about our fair value measurements 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted fin 48 and fsp no 481 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in addition fin 48 provides guidance on the derecognition classification and disclosure of tax positions as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties fsp no 481 provides guidance associated 

with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit 

 

refer to note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of these new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position 

 

reclassification of segment information  — during the second quarter of 2008 we moved certain canadian business operations from the western group to the midwest group to facilitate improved business execution we have reflected the impact of this change for all periods presented to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our operations 

 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities stockholders’ equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments and selfinsurance reserves and recoveries as described below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

landfills  — the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 143 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of construction related to each final capping event and of closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations 

 

landfill costs  — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

 

final capping costs  — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

closure and postclosure costs  — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

remaining permitted airspace  — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

 

expansion airspace  — we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 42 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2008 19 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace ten of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process the remaining nine landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one or fiveyear requirements as a result of statespecific permitting procedures 

 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor or auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent 

multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher final capping closure or postclosure rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

 

environmental remediation liabilities  — we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party or prp investigations settlements certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates and assumptions 

 

we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

asset impairments  — our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we review the carrying value of our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in order to assess whether a potential impairment exists the assets’ carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates 

and our estimates often vary from cash flows eventually realized impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market environment for similar assets if the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 

 

there are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below 

 

landfills  — certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry 

 

goodwill  — at least annually we assess whether goodwill is impaired we assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each group to its carrying value including goodwill we rely on discounted cash flow analysis which requires significant judgments and estimates about the future operations of each group to develop our estimates of fair value additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that more likely than not the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired 

 

selfinsurance reserves and recoveries  — we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

 

results of operations 

 

operating revenues 

 

our operating revenues in 2008 were 134 billion compared with 133 billion in 2007 and 134 billion in 2006 we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western wheelabrator and wmra groups these six operating groups are our reportable segments shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our six operating groups and our other waste services 

 

 

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer wheelabrator and recycling services revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency type of collection equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to the disposal facility and our disposal costs revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the weight volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site our wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam recycling revenue which is generated by our wmra group as well as recycling operations embedded in the operations of our four geographic operating groups generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties the fees we charge for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges which are indexed to current market costs for fuel our “other” revenues include our inplant services methane gas recovery portolet ® services street and parking lot sweeping services portable selfstorage fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare solutions services intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements the mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 

 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions and includes internal revenue growth calculated as a percentage of revenues from related business and as a percentage of total company revenues 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

base business  — yield on base business reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer disposal and wastetoenergy operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price and environmental and service fee increases but also i certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii price decreases to retain customers 

 

in both 2008 and 2007 our pricing excellence initiative was the primary contributor to our revenue growth from base business yield although our pricing programs are contributing to yield improvements in each of our core solid waste lines of business the increase in revenue from base business yield has been driven by our collection operations in each reported period increased collection revenues due to yield were more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes however we continue to find that in spite of collection volume declines increased yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs provide notable margin improvements and earnings expansion in our collection line of business 

 

throughout 2008 and 2007 we also experienced increases in revenue due to yield on base business from our pricing excellence initiative at our transfer stations and the municipal solid waste streams at our landfills the increases in transfer station revenues have been the most significant in the eastern portion of the united states at our landfills municipal solid waste revenue growth from yield has been the most significant in our southern group although the midwest and western groups also provided notable revenue growth from yield in this line of business in 2007 we also experienced increases in revenue due to yield on base business in the special waste and construction and demolition waste streams at our landfills 

 

in addition to the revenue growth provided by our pricing initiative we saw an increase in revenue from yield at our wastetoenergy facilities in 2008 this increase was largely due to annual rate increases for electricity under longterm contracts and favorable energy market pricing which is generally indexed to natural gas prices 

 

revenues from our environmental fee which is included in base business yield were 181 million 121 million and 76 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

commodity  — for the first nine months of 2008 revenues increased 178 million due to higher recycling prices as compared with the prior year period however during the fourth quarter of 2008 a rapid decline in commodity prices due to a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and 

internationally caused a yearoveryear revenue decrease of 97 million in 2008 average prices for old corrugated cardboard decreased 9 and average prices for old newsprint increased by 14 however when comparing commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the comparable prior year period average prices for old corrugated cardboard decreased by 58 and average prices for old newsprint decreased by 30 

 

in 2007 average prices for old corrugated cardboard increased by 62 and average prices for old newsprint increased by 39 when compared with 2006 which drove the 306 million of revenue growth from commodity yield in 2007 

 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees  — fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by 189 million in 2008 this increase is due to our continued effort to pass on our higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges although our fuel surcharge program is designed to respond to changes in the market price for fuel there is an administrative delay between the time our fuel costs change and when we are able to make the corresponding change in our fuel surcharges this delay negatively affected our ability to fully recover our cost increases in the first six months of 2008 as the increases in our fuel surcharges consistently lagged the sharp increases in fuel costs throughout the first half of the year however the cost of fuel began to decline during the third quarter of 2008 allowing us to fully recover the fuel cost increases we incurred during the year 

 

fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by 29 million in 2007 market prices for fuel were relatively flat for the first nine months of 2007 but increased sharply during the fourth quarter accordingly all of the revenue increase due to fuel surcharges in 2007 was generated during the fourth quarter and we were unable to fully recover our higher fuel costs for the period 

 

the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the passthrough of fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above 

 

volume  — the decline in our revenues due to lower volumes when comparing 2008 with 2007 has been driven by declines in our collection volumes and to a lesser extent lower transfer station recycling and thirdparty disposal volumes decreases in 2008 revenue due to lower volumes are discussed in more detail below 

 

our revenues from collection volumes continue to be affected by our focus on improving margins through increased pricing however the slowdown in the economy has also had a significant impact on our industrial collection line of business as a result of the continued slowdown in both residential and commercial construction activities across the united states while our commercial collection line of business tends to be relatively recession resistant we have experienced some volume declines in this business that we attribute to the sluggish economy 

 

declines in revenue due to lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations have been the most notable in our eastern and southern groups and can generally be attributed to the effects of pricing and sluggish economic conditions the declines in our revenues due to lower volumes in our recycling operations are attributable to the drastic decline in the demand for recyclables in late 2008 both domestically and internationally 

 

we have experienced declines in thirdparty revenue at our landfills due to reduced construction and demolition and municipal solid waste volumes throughout 2008 although the volume decline in our construction and demolition waste stream was at a slower rate than it had been in 2007 largely as a result of hurricanerelated volume increases in our southern group these volume declines have been offset in part by an increase in special waste disposal volumes primarily in our southern group 

 

the decline in our revenues due to lower volumes when comparing 2007 with 2006 was driven by declines in our collection volumes and to a lesser extent lower transfer station and thirdparty disposal volumes decreases in 2007 revenue due to lower volumes are discussed in more detail below 

 

collection volume declines significantly affected the revenues of each of our collection lines of business in each geographic operating group but they were the most significant in our industrial collection business due to the significant slowdown in residential construction across the united states 

in 2007 declines in revenue due to lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations were the most notable in our eastern group and were generally due to the effects of pricing we also experienced declines in thirdparty revenue at our landfills due to reduced disposal volumes the most significant declines were in our construction and demolition waste particularly in our southern group the reduction in construction and demolition volumes was largely due to the significant slowdown in residential construction across the united states the volume declines for our municipal solid waste disposal operations were the most significant in our midwest group due primarily to our focus on pricing increases 

 

wastetoenergy and recycling revenues also declined in 2007 due to volume decreases in our wastetoenergy business the decrease was largely due to the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in may 2007 the revenue decline due to lower thirdparty volumes in our recycling business was primarily attributable to the decreases in certain brokerage activities and the closure of a plastics processing facility 

 

acquisitions and divestitures  — revenues increased 117 million in 2008 and 37 million in 2007 due to acquisitions principally in the collection transfer and recycling businesses although we also made acquisitions in 2008 in our “other” business as we focus on entering new lines of business divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of 130 million in 2008 and 320 million in 2007 these divestitures were primarily comprised of collection operations and to a lesser extent transfer station and recycling operations in the second third and fourth quarters of 2008 revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded revenue declines from divestitures a trend we had not seen in over two years this change reflects i that there are less underperforming operations that are being considered for divestiture and ii the resulting shift of focus to accretive acquisitions 

 

operating expenses 

 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are driven by variables such as volumes distance and fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include interest accretion on asset retirement and environmental remediation obligations leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs ix risk management costs which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent and property taxes 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

the changes in our operating expenses for 2008 and 2007 compared with the prior years can largely be attributed to the following 

 

 32 

 

  

additionally during the fourth quarter of 2008 we incurred another 18 million in “labor and related benefits” charges associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units in our midwest and eastern groups from underfunded multiemployer pension plans 

 

in 2007 our western group incurred “other” operating expenses of 33 million for security labor lodging travel and other costs incurred as a result of labor disruptions in oakland and los angeles california 

 

  

many of the cost increases summarized above are due to general economic and market conditions over which we have little or no control after considering the significant impacts of marketdriven factors we are encouraged that our results continue to reflect our focus on i identifying operational efficiencies that translate into cost savings ii managing our fixed costs and reducing our variable costs as volumes decline due to our pricing program and the downturn in the economy and iii reducing our costs in light of recent divestitures 

 

other items affecting the comparability of our operating expenses by category for the three years presented include the following 

 

labor and related benefits 

 

  

transfer and disposal costs 

 

  

disposal and franchise fees and taxes 

 

  

landfill operating costs 

 

 33 

  

risk management 

 

  

other 

 

  

selling general and administrative 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

a significant portion of the 45 million increase in our “selling general and administrative” expenses in 2008 was as a result of our focus on business development initiatives including gaining new customers and entering new lines of business we estimate that these initiatives increased our expenses by nearly 19 million when comparing 2008 with 2007 approximately 8 million of the 19 million increase is associated with increased consulting costs and has been included in “professional fees” the remaining cost increases can generally be attributed to increased headcount advertising and travel and entertainment costs 

 

other significant changes in our selling general and administrative expenses during the reported periods are summarized below 

 

labor and related benefits  — the increases in 2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to i higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit raises ii higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by an increase in the size of our sales force and our focus on our people and business development initiatives and iii higher noncash compensation costs associated with the equitybased compensation provided for by our longterm incentive plans in 2008 we also experienced higher insurance and benefit costs these increases were 

partially offset by lower bonus expenses accrued in 2008 because our performance against targets established by our incentive plan was not as strong as it had been in either 2007 or 2006 

 

professional fees  — we incurred significant costs in both 2008 and 2007 that are of a nonrecurring nature in 2008 we incurred over 7 million of legal and consulting costs to support our previously proposed acquisition of republic services inc in 2007 our consulting fees were higher due to increased spending for various strategic initiatives including the support and development of the sap waste and recycling revenue management system which we discontinued development of in early 2008 for information related to the current status of our pending litigation against sap refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements 

 

provision for bad debts  — the increase in our provision for bad debts in 2008 is due to the effects of the weakened economy which has increased collection risks associated with certain customers 

 

other  — as discussed above our continued focus on our sales marketing and other initiatives and identifying new customers resulted in increases in our advertising costs and travel and entertainment costs in 2008 the comparability of these costs for the periods presented has also been affected by net charges of approximately 2 million in 2007 and 20 million in 2006 to record our estimated obligations for unclaimed property additionally in both 2007 and 2006 our other costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs and higher travel and entertainment costs due partially to the development of our revenue management system and our efforts to implement various initiatives 

 

depreciation and amortization 

 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded due to capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

 

the following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

in both 2008 and 2007 the decrease in depreciation on tangible property and equipment is largely due to i components of enterprisewide software becoming fullydepreciated and ii our focus on identifying operational efficiencies as we shed unprofitable business which has allowed us to retire or sell underutilized assets 

 

the decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in 2008 and 2007 is largely due to volume declines as a result of i the slowdown in the economy ii our pricing program which has significantly reduced our collection volumes and iii the redirection of waste to thirdparty disposal facilities in certain regions due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current capacity constraints of landfills where we are working on procuring an expansion permit the comparability of our amortization of landfill airspace for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 has also been affected by adjustments recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 landfill amortization expense was reduced by 3 million 17 million and 1 million respectively for the effects of these 

changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities ii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs or iii completed final capping construction that cost less than anticipated 

 

restructuring 

 

management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure as discussed in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in february 2009 we announced that we were taking steps to streamline our organization by consolidating many of our market areas and realigning our corporate support organization in 2008 we recognized 2 million of restructuring expenses for the reorganization of customer service functions in our western group and the realignment of certain operations in our southern group in the first quarter of 2007 we restructured certain operations and functions resulting in the recognition of a charge of approximately 9 million we incurred an additional 1 million of costs for this restructuring during the second quarter of 2007 increasing total costs incurred to 10 million approximately 7 million of the 2007 restructuring costs was incurred by our corporate organization 2 million was incurred by our midwest group and 1 million was incurred by our western group these charges included approximately 8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and approximately 2 million related to operating lease agreements 

 

the most significant cost savings we have obtained through these restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “selling general and administrative” expenses 

 

income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 

 

income expense from divestitures including heldforsale impairments  — the net gains from divestitures in all three years were a result of our fixorseekexit initiative in 2008 these gains were primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our southern group in 2007 the gains were related to the divestiture of underperforming collection transfer and recycling operations in our eastern western southern and wmra groups and in 2006 the gains were primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our western group gains recognized from divestitures in 2006 were partially offset by the recognition of aggregate impairment charges of 18 million which were principally recognized by our eastern group for business operations held for sale as required by sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  

 

impairments of assets heldforuse  — during 2008 we recognized a 4 million impairment charge primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our southern group during 2007 we recognized 12 million in impairment charges due to impairments recognized for two landfills in our southern group the impairments were necessary as a result of the reevaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for the second landfill the 24 million of impairment charges recognized during 2006 was primarily related to the impairment of a landfill in our eastern group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the impairment of underperforming operations in our wmra group 

other  — in 2006 we recognized a 26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000 

 

income from operations by reportable segment 

 

the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

operating segments  — the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our geographic operating segments during the threeyear period ended december 31 2008 are i increased revenue from yield on base business as a result of our pricing strategies particularly in our collection operations ii declines in revenues due to lower volumes which can be attributed to pricing competition the significant downturn in construction and the slowdown of the general economy and iii our continued focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies for the first nine months of 2008 our groups also experienced an unfavorable effect on operating income of significantly higher fuel costs however during the fourth quarter of 2008 fuel costs decreased significantly enough to reverse this trend resulting in an immaterial impact to the full year see additional discussion in the operating revenues section above 

 

summarized below are the other significant items specific to each operating segment’s results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

eastern  — the group’s operating income for the year ended december 31 2008 was negatively affected by a 14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans this charge was offset in part by a reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations the group’s operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 was favorably affected by i net divestiture gains of 33 million ii an 18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter and iii a reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations the group’s operating income for the year ended december 31 2006 was negatively affected by 26 million in impairment charges associated with i businesses being sold as part of our divestiture program and ii a change in our expectations for future operations of a landfill in 2006 the group also incurred 14 million of strikerelated costs incurred primarily in the new york city area 

 

midwest  — the group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by 44 million of additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of a labor dispute in milwaukee wisconsin included in the labor dispute expenses is a 32 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain of the group’s bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans in addition the group experienced unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2008 positively affecting operating results both in 2008 and in 2007 

were divestiture gains of 4 million in 2008 and 1 million in 2007 and reductions in landfill amortization expense resulting from changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations 

 

southern  — during 2008 the increase in the group’s operating income is largely due to 29 million of divestiture gains offset in part by a 3 million landfill impairment charge during 2007 the group recorded 12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of its landfills these charges were largely offset by gains on divestitures of 11 million 

 

western  — the group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by an increase in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations in 2007 labor disputes negatively affected the group’s operating results by 37 million principally as a result of “operating” expenses incurred for security deployment and lodging costs for replacement workers gains on divestitures of operations were 16 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared with 48 million for 2006 

 

wheelabrator  — the group’s 2008 operating results were favorably affected by increases in market rates for energy during the second half of 2008 the decline in operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 was driven by a 21 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007 for the early termination of a lease agreement the early termination was due to the group’s purchase of an independent power production plant that it had previously operated through a lease agreement additionally the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in may 2007 resulted in a decline in revenue and operating income compared with the prior year 

 

wmra  — during the first nine months of 2008 and throughout all of 2007 the group’s operating income benefited from substantial increases in market prices for commodities also during these periods the group experienced income growth due to an increased focus on maintaining or reducing rebates made to suppliers during the fourth quarter of 2008 however commodity prices dropped sharply as a result of a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and internationally this significant decline in commodity prices resulted in operating losses that more than offset the income generated during the first nine months of the year higher than normal operating expenses including higher subcontractor repair and maintenance and facility startup costs also negatively affected the group’s operating income throughout 2008 the comparison of the group’s operating income for the periods presented has also been affected by i 7 million of net gains on divestitures in 2007 and ii the recognition in 2006 of 10 million of charges for a loss from a divestiture and an impairment of certain underperforming operations which were slightly more than offset by savings associated with the group’s cost control efforts 

 

significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are summarized below 

 

other  — the unfavorable change in operating results in 2008 when compared with 2007 is the result of costs being incurred to support our increased focus on the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business the unfavorable change in operating results in 2007 when compared with 2006 is largely related to i certain yearend adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed and ii the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in april 2006 

 

corporate and other  — the decline in expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007 was primarily due to 

 

 38 

 

the expense declines noted above were largely offset by the impacts of the following 

 

 • costs incurred for the potential acquisition of republic during the third quarter of 2008 

 

the decline in expenses when comparing 2007 with 2006 was primarily due to 

 

• significantly lower risk management costs largely due to our focus on safety and controlling costs 

  

the expense declines noted above were offset in part by the impacts of the following 

 

  

other components of net income 

 

the following table summarizes the other major components of our income for the year ended december 31 for each respective period dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

interest expense 

 

although our outstanding debt balances are relatively consistent yearoveryear the decline in interest costs when comparing 2008 with 2007 is generally related to i the maturity of higher rate debt that we have refinanced at lower interest rates ii significant declines in market interest rates which impact the interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps and our variable rate debt and iii the early redemption of 244 million of 875 senior notes during the second quarter of 2008 which resulted in the recognition of a reduction in interest expense of approximately 10 million for the immediate recognition of fair value adjustments associated with terminated interest rate swaps that had been deferred and were being amortized over the life of the debt the decrease in interest expense when comparing 2007 with 2006 is largely related to a decrease in our average debt balances 

 

we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates the combined impact of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in a net interest expense decrease of 50 million for 2008 and net interest expense increases of 11 million for 2007 and 4 million for 2006 our active interest rate swaps decreased our interest expense in 2008 by 8 million compared with an increase in interest expense in 2007 from active hedges of 48 million the significant change in the impact of our active interest rate swaps when comparing 2008 with 2007 has been driven by the decrease in shortterm market interest rates which 

drive our periodic interest obligations under our active swap agreements our periodic interest obligations under these agreements are based on a spread from the threemonth libor which was as low as 143 in late 2008 and as high as 562 in the second half of 2007 in 2008 the yearoveryear change in the impact of interest rate swaps is also due to our terminated swaps which caused a 42 million reduction in interest expense in 2008 compared with a 37 million reduction in interest expense in 2007 our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by 18 million in 2009 11 million in 2010 and 5 million in 2011 

 

interest income 

 

when comparing 2008 with 2007 the decrease in interest income is primarily due to i significant declines in market interest rates ii the recognition of 7 million in interest income during the first quarter of 2007 for the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our eastern group and iii a decrease in our average cash and investment balances when comparing 2007 with 2006 the decrease in interest income is primarily due to i a decrease in our average cash and investment balances and ii 14 million of interest income realized in 2006 on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits 

 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

 

during the reported periods our “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our equity interests in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the equity losses generated by the facilities were offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for income taxes 

 

our equity in the losses of these facilities was 3 million for the year ended december 31 2008 42 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 41 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the significant decline in these losses in 2008 as compared with the prior year periods is due to the expiration of our investments at the end of 2007 the comparability of the losses incurred in 2007 and 2006 is primarily affected by i the impact of the partial phaseout of section 45k credits during each year on our contractual obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses ii the temporary suspension of operations at the facilities in 2006 and iii the recognition of a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately reflect our lifetodate obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and the value of our investment which was recognized in 2006 refer to note 8 for additional information related to the impact of these investments 

 

minority interest 

 

on december 31 2003 we consolidated two limited liability companies that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator group as a result of our implementation of fin 46r our minority interest expense for 2008 2007 and 2006 is primarily related to the other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities additional information related to these investments is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 669 million in 2008 540 million in 2007 and 325 million in 2006 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 381 317 and 221 for each of the three years respectively at current income levels we expect that our 2009 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 40 the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 is primarily affected by i increases in our income before taxes ii differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements and iii the impact of nonconventional fuel tax credits which expired at the end of 2007 the impacts of tax audit settlements and nonconventional fuel tax credits which are the items that had the most significant impacts on the comparability of our effective tax rate during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are summarized below

other items that have affected our reported income taxes during the reported periods include the following 

 

  

landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis 

 

we owned or operated 267 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2008 and we owned or operated 271 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2007 at december 31 2008 and 2007 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 

 

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2008 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 32 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are seeking expansion permits at 42 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section above although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume 

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2008 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 42 

 

the tons received at our landfills in 2008 and 2007 are shown below in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

when a landfill we own or operate i reaches its permitted waste capacity ii is permanently capped and iii receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency management of the site including remediation activities is generally transferred to our closed sites management group in addition to the 273 active landfills we managed at december 31 2008 we managed 195 closed landfills 

 

landfill assets  — we capitalize various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept waste these costs generally include expenditures for land including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property permitting excavation liner material and installation landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities which are discussed further below 

 

the following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2008 we estimate that we will spend approximately 500 million in 2009 and approximately 1 billion in 2010 and 2011 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations 

landfill and environmental remediation liabilities  — as we accept waste at our landfills we incur significant asset retirement obligations which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations and its interpretations and are discussed in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated 

 

the following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

landfill costs and expenses  — as disclosed in the operating expenses section above our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets leachate and methane collection and treatment landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs the following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated in millions 

 

 

 

the increase in these costs in 2008 can largely be attributed to a significant decline in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities which is based on the rate for united states treasury bonds with a term approximating the weightedaverage period until settlement of the underlying obligations during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a 33 million charge to “operating” expenses offset in part by a 6 million reduction in “minority interest” expense to reduce the discount rate from 400 to 225 we recorded an 8 million charge to “operating” expenses during the fourth quarter of 2007 to reduce the discount rate from 475 to 400 and a 6 million decrease in “operating” expenses during the fourth quarter of 2006 to increase the discount rate from 425 to 475 additionally in 2008 our leachate collection costs were higher in our eastern group and midwest group due to increased precipitation and operational changes in these regions 

amortization of landfill airspace which is included as a component of “depreciation and amortization” expense includes the following 

 

  

amortization expense is recorded on a unitsofconsumption basis applying cost as a rate per ton the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace landfill capital costs and closure and postclosure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are therefore amortized on a per ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity final capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific final capping event and are therefore amortized on a per ton basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated airspace capacity accordingly each landfill has multiple per ton amortization rates 

 

the following table calculates our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per ton basis 

 

 

 

different per ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 273 landfills and per ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to the next due to i inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping closure and postclosure activities and ii differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire accordingly our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes received across the company yearoveryear the comparability of our total company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations landfill amortization expense was reduced by 3 million in 2008 17 million in 2007 and 1 million in 2006 for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of i concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities ii landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs or iii completed final capping construction that cost less than anticipated 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet iii construction refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills and vi repaying debt and discharging other obligations we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business 

summary of cash shortterm investments restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

 

the following is a summary of our cash shortterm investments available for use restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in united states government obligations all of which have original maturities of three months or less 

 

restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of our debt obligations funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

 

debt  — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2008 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 can primarily be attributed to i net debt repayments of 260 million ii noncash proceeds from taxexempt borrowings net of principal payments made directly from trust funds of 169 million iii a 78 million increase in the carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps and iv the impacts of accounting for other noncash changes in our balances due to foreign currency translation interest and capital leases 

 

we have approximately 12 billion of scheduled debt maturities during the next twelve months we have classified approximately 509 million of these borrowings as longterm as of december 31 2008 based on our intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis 

we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit in millions at december 31 categorized by facility 

 

 

 

 

  

summary of cash flow activity 

 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below 

 

 47 

  

  

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below 

 

  

net cash used in investing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

 48 

  

  

net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

  

we paid 410 million for share repurchases in 2008 as compared with 1421 million in 2007 and 1072 million in 2006 we repurchased approximately 12 million 40 million and 31 million shares of our common stock in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the significant decline in share repurchases during 2008 is largely attributable to the suspension of our share repurchases in connection with our proposal to acquire all of the outstanding stock of republic services inc when the proposal was withdrawn in october 2008 we determined that given the state of the financial markets it would be prudent to suspend repurchases for the foreseeable future 

 

we paid an aggregate of 531 million in cash dividends during 2008 compared with 495 million in 2007 and 476 million in 2006 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 022 in 2006 to 024 in 2007 and to 027 in 2008 the impact of the yearoveryear increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase program 

 

in december 2008 our board of directors approved a new capital allocation program that includes the authorization for up to 13 billion in combined cash dividends common stock repurchases debt reduction and acquisitions in 2009 at this time the board of directors also announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be 029 per share all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant 

 

 49 

 

  

 

 

this summary excludes the impacts of noncash borrowings and debt repayments for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 these noncash financing activities were primarily associated with our taxexempt bond financings proceeds from taxexempt bond issuances net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds were 169 million in 2008 144 million in 2007 and 157 million in 2006 

 

  

summary of contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

 

 

  

we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely as a result the impact of these contingencies has not been included in the above table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 

 

liquidity impacts of uncertain tax positions 

 

as discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest these liabilities are primarily included as a component of longterm “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet because the company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements our thirdparty guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2008 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

seasonal trends and inflation 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes generally experienced by our southern group can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of fuel have affected our operating margins in recent periods we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

sfas no 157 — fair value measurements 

 

in february 2008 the fasb issued staff position fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157  which delayed the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis accordingly as of december 31 2008 we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 157 to our asset retirement obligations which are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 143 fsp fas 1572 establishes january 1 2009 as the effective date of sfas no 157 with respect to these fair value measurements for the company we do not currently expect the application of the fair value framework established by sfas no 157 to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however we will continue to assess the potential effects of sfas no 157 as additional guidance becomes available 

 

sfas no 141r — business combinations 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations  which establishes principles for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in the financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree this statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective for the company beginning january 1 2009 the portions of the statement that relate to business combinations completed before the effective date will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however our adoption of sfas no 141r will significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions principally as a result of i expanded requirements to value acquired assets liabilities and contingencies at their fair values and ii the requirement that acquisitionrelated transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition 

 

sfas no 160 — noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary it states that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas no 160 will be effective for the company beginning january 1 2009 and must be applied prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied 

retrospectively for all periods presented the adoption of sfas no 160 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however it could impact our accounting for future transactions

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2008 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider creditworthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 

 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 

 

interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are primarily denominated in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations which directly impacts variability in interest costs as of december 31 2008 33 of our total debt is at variable interest rates compared with 34 at december 31 2007 an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately 595 million at december 31 2008 and 445 million at december 31 2007 as disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements there have not been any material changes in the amount or type of debt or derivatives outstanding since december 31 2007 nor has there been a material change in the extent of our exposure to variability in interest rates accordingly the significant increase when comparing the effect of the one percentage point increase at december 31 2008 with december 31 2007 can be attributed to a substantial decline in riskfree interest rates which are used in the discounted cash flow analysis performed to support this disclosure this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on items other than our outstanding debt and interest rate derivatives nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 

 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have 381 million and 418 million of assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure postclosure and environmental remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

 

currency rate exposure from time to time we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company

general 

 

the financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary waste management inc is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wmi” we are referring only to the parent holding company 

 

wmi was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wmi and changed its name to waste management holdings inc at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wmi wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries for detail on the financial position results of operations and cash flows of wmi wm holdings and their subsidiaries see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street suite 4000 houston texas 77002 our telephone number at that address is 713 5126200 our website address is httpwwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wmi” 

 

we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america using our vast network of assets and employees we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services through our subsidiaries we provide collection transfer recycling disposal and wastetoenergy services in providing these services we actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment including recovering and processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities during 2007 none of our customers accounted for more than 1 of our operating revenue we employed approximately 47400 people as of december 31 2007 

 

strategy 

 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving five key stakeholders our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our shareholders our goals are 

 

  

our strategy which we believe will enable us to meet these goals remains the same as last year improve our organization and maximize returns to shareholders by focusing on operational excellence pricing excellence and profitably growing our business we continue our efforts toward revenue growth through pricing and are continuously working to lower operating and selling general and administrative costs through process standardization and productivity improvements additionally we have been improving our portfolio of businesses through our “fix or seek exit” initiative all of these measures help us to generate strong and consistent cash flows from operations that can be used to maximize shareholder value 

 

as we move forward we are building on our strategy to meet the needs of a changing environment and to make the most of the successes we have had so far as the largest waste services provider in north america we believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of the customers and communities we serve as they too think green ®  we 

believe that doing things that will help our customers achieve their environmental goals will help us achieve profitable growth we regularly help customers reduce reuse and recycle the waste they produce we also focus on what is left and in many cases convert the waste to a usable energy source by focusing on providing new environmentally responsible and sustainable solutions to our customers’ waste problems we believe we can create a competitive advantage across all of our lines of business 

 

our focus on operational excellence has provided us a foundation on which to build we believe we are well positioned to enhance that foundation by seeking profitable growth through targeted sales efforts and acquisitions we are seeking to grow our current business in a variety of areas including wastebased energy and singlestream recycling we also are looking at new ways to grow we believe we can make investments that are synergistic and that are going to take advantage of what we do best to give us revenue and earnings growth 

 

operations 

 

general 

 

we manage and evaluate our principal operations through six operating groups of which four are organized by geographic area and two are organized by function the geographic groups include our eastern midwest southern and western groups and the two functional groups are our wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services and our wm recycle america “wmra” group which provides recycling services not managed by our geographic groups we also provide additional waste management services that are not managed through our six groups these services include inplant services where we work at our clients’ facilities to provide environmental management systems and provide opportunities for process improvements and associated cost reductions in their waste management other services not managed within our groups include methane gas recovery and thirdparty subcontracted and administrative services these services are presented in this report as “other” 

 

the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2007 more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

 

the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wheelabrator wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

 

 

 

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to a transfer station or disposal site we generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements 

 

  

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america and we have the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are built and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are operated under prescribed procedures a landfill must be maintained to meet federal state or provincial and local regulations the operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes 

 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill we believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

 

we also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under federal environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a 

stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

 

we owned or operated 271 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2007 and we owned or operated 277 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2006 the landfills that we operate but do not own are generally operated under a lease agreement or an operating contract the differences between the two arrangements usually relate to the owner of the landfill operating permit under lease agreements the permit typically is in our name and we operate the landfill for its entire life making payments to the lessor based either on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received we are usually responsible for the closure and postclosure obligations of the landfills we lease for operating contracts the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term which may be the life of the landfill the property owner is generally responsible for closure and postclosure obligations under our operating contracts 

 

based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31 2007 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 30 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are currently seeking expansion permits at 54 of our landfills for which we consider expansions to be likely although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 37 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume remaining permitted airspace and expansion airspace are defined in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report under “— critical accounting estimates and assumptions” at december 31 2007 and 2006 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 

the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

the number of landfills we own or operate as of december 31 2007 segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows 

 

 

 

the volume of waste that we received in 2007 was lower than in 2006 primarily as a result of pricing competition and a slow down in residential construction which are discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report the tons received at our landfills in 2007 and 2006 are shown below in thousands 

 

 

 

  

when a landfill we own or operate i reaches its permitted waste capacity ii is permanently capped and iii receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency management of the site including remediation activities is generally transferred to our closed sites management group in addition to the 277 active landfills we managed at december 31 2007 we managed 187 closed landfills 

 

transfer at december 31 2007 we owned or operated 341 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

 

access to transfer stations is often critical to thirdparty haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in close proximity to their collection operations fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites 

 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own are generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for the regulatory requirements relating to the operation closure and post closure of the transfer station 

 

wheelabrator as of december 31 2007 we owned or operated 16 wastetoenergy facilities and five independent power production plants or ipps that are located in the northeast and in florida california and washington 

 

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam as of december 31 2007 our wastetoenergy facilities were capable of processing up to 21000 tons of solid waste each day a decrease in capacity of approximately 3000 tons per day from december 31 2006 in 2007 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 71 million tons of solid waste or approximately 19500 tons per day in 2006 our wastetoenergy facilities received and processed 78 million tons of solid waste or approximately 21300 tons per day the decline in both the capacity and production of our wastetoenergy facilities during 2007 was due to the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in may 2007 

 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

 

we sell the steam produced at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps to industrial and commercial users steam that is not sold is used to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities fees charged for steam and electricity at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps are generally subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market conditions such as inflation natural gas prices and other general market factors 

recycling our wmra group focuses on improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs within communities and industries in addition to our wmra group our four geographic operating groups provide certain recycling services that are embedded within the groups’ other operations and therefore are not included within the wmra group’s financial results 

 

recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

 

collection and materials processing  — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our material recovery facilities “mrfs” for processing we operate 99 mrfs where paper glass metals and plastics are recovered for resale we also operate six secondary processing facilities where materials received from mrfs can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods specifically material processing services include data destruction automated color sorting and construction and demolition processing 

 

plastics and rubber materials recycling  — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic and rubber commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

 

electronics recycling services  — we provide an innovative customized approach to recycling discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials 

 

commodities recycling  — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities for our own facilities and for third parties by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

 

during 2006 we also provided glass recycling services however we divested of our glass recycling facilities in 2006 as part of our continued focus on improving the profitability of our business 

 

fees for recycling services are influenced by frequency of collection type and volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

 

our wmra group purchases recyclable materials processed in our mrfs from various sources including third parties and other operating subsidiaries of wmi the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the finished goods to our customers the price our wmra group pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” and is based upon the price we receive for sales of finished goods and local market conditions as a result higher commodity prices increase our revenues and increase the rebates we pay to our suppliers 

 

other we provide inplant services in which employees of our upstream organization work fulltime inside our customers’ facilities to provide fullservice waste management solutions our vertically integrated waste management operations allow us to provide customers with full management of their waste including identifying recycling opportunities minimizing waste and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal 

 

we also develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the united states environmental protection agency endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources at december 31 2007 landfill gas beneficial use projects were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 108 of our solid waste landfills at 80 of these landfills the processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 21 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes at seven landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

in addition we rent and service portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  and provide street and parking lot sweeping services we also have begun providing portable selfstorage and fluorescent lamp recycling services from time to time we are also contracted to construct waste facilities on behalf of third parties 

 

competition 

 

the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies private solid waste companies large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private wastetoenergy companies we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills the municipalities and regional governmental authorities are often able to offer lower direct charges to customers for the same service by subsidizing their costs through the use of tax revenues and taxexempt financing generally however municipalities do not provide significant commercial and industrial collection or waste disposal 

 

we compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other companies own or operate their own landfills to which they will send their waste we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and quality of services operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition based on pricing and quality of service under certain customer service contracts our ability to increase our prices or pass on cost increases to our customers may be limited from time to time competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2007 we had approximately 47400 fulltime employees of which approximately 7900 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 11700 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

 

financial assurance 

 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits various forms of financial assurance are also required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure postclosure and remedial obligations at many of our landfills in addition certain of our taxexempt borrowings require us to hold funds in trust for the repayment of our interest and principal obligations 

we establish financial assurance using surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the type of assurance used is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

 

 9 

 

  

the assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established other than these permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

 

insurance 

 

we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy our general liability workers’ compensation and auto insurance programs have per incident deductibles of 25 million 15 million and 1 million respectively effective january 1 2008 we increased the per incident deductible for our workers’ compensation insurance program to 5 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2007 are summarized in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

regulation 

 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

 

because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain necessary required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain necessary governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

 10 

releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have created actual or potential environmental hazards cercla’s primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal sites upon current and former site owners and operators generators of the hazardous substances at the site and transporters who selected the disposal site and transported substances thereto liability under cercla is not dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous substances it can be based upon the release or threatened release even as a result of lawful unintentional and nonnegligent action of hazardous substances as the term is defined by cercla and other applicable statutes and regulations liability may include contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a cercla civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators in an administrative or judicially approved settlement liability could also include liability to a prp that voluntarily expends site cleanup costs further liability may include damage to publicly owned natural resources we are subject to potential liability under cercla as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed or as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations 

 

  

the epa has issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years 

 

 11 

  

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not otherwise preempted by federal law additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling 

 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional but in 2007 the court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level could adversely affect our operations courts’ interpretation of flow control legislation or the supreme court decisions also could adversely affect our solid waste management services 

 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

see notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of regulations on our current and future operations 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in an effort to keep our shareholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements generally include statements containing 

 

  

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2008 and beyond these are not the only risks that we face there may be other risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also impair our business and financial position 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists of large national waste management companies and local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage 

 

in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts when this happens we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or retain our customers resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

 

if we do not successfully manage our costs our income from operations could be lower than expected 

 

in recent years we have implemented several profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our revenues and we continue to seek ways to reduce our selling general and administrative and operating expenses while generally we have been successful in managing our costs including subcontractor costs and the effect of fuel price increases our initiatives may not be sufficient even as our revenues increase if we are unable to control variable costs or increases to our fixed costs in the future we will be unable to maintain or expand our margins 

 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement our plans and strategies to improve margins and increase our income from operations 

 

we have announced several programs and strategies that we have implemented or planned to improve our margins and operating results for example except when prohibited by contract we have implemented price increases and environmental fees and we continue our fuel surcharge programs all of which have increased our internal revenue growth the loss of volumes as a result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations additionally we continue to seek to divest underperforming and nonstrategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability we may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and nonstrategic operations which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of lowmargin businesses if we are not able to fully implement our plans for any reason many of which are out of our control we may not see the expected improvements in our income from operations or our operating margins 

 

the seasonal nature of our business and changes in general and local economic conditions cause our quarterly results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes experienced during 2004 and 2005 actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

our business is affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are also outside of our control including interest rates and consumer confidence we have 29 billion of debt as of december 31 2007 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the combined impact of our variable rate taxexempt bonds and our interest rate swap agreements therefore any increase in interest rates can significantly increase our expenses additionally although our services are of an essential nature a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues we also face risks related to other adverse 

external factors such as the ability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect that significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may have on such ability 

 

any of the factors described above could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally due to these and other factors operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period 

 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety laws and cannot guarantee that they will not be material 

 

we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past and may in the future become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and 

land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

 

governmental authorities may enact climate change regulations that could increase our costs to operate 

 

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change the adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases including the imposition of fees or taxes could adversely affect our collection and disposal operations additionally certain of the states in which we operate are contemplating air pollution control regulations that are more stringent than existing and proposed federal regulations changing environmental regulations could require us to take any number of actions including the purchase of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution control technology and could make some operations less profitable which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 

 

the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have ranged from an increase of 28 to a decrease of 5 we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs we may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising costs of fuel although there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that such programs will be successful regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs the increased operating costs will decrease our operating margins 

 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels we face the risk of incurring liabilities for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby allowing us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to environmental closure and postclosure liabilities we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance or fund trust and escrow accounts we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations we do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future however in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance these types of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain which could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

 

the possibility of development and expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge against our earnings 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other 

projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired a pending acquisition is not completed a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility acquisition or project we reduce the charge against earnings by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise 

 

in future periods we may be required to incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or due to other events that cause impairments any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard known as occ and old newsprint or onp in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the quarterly average market prices for occ ranged from a decrease of as much as 34 to an increase of as much as 83 the same comparisons for onp have ranged from a decrease of as much as 16 to an increase of as much as 47 these fluctuations can affect future operating income and cash flows additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers based on the market prices of commodities we buy to process for resale therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase 

 

additionally there may be significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energy related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations the marketing and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and wastetoenergy operations are generally pursuant to longterm sales agreements therefore market fluctuations do not have a significant effect on these operations in the shortterm however as those agreements expire and are up for renewal changes in market prices may affect our revenues additionally revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly electricity prices have increased or decreased by as much as 5 

 

the development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity 

 

our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting in addition some state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities although such mandates are a useful tool to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services 

 

efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could increase our operating expenses 

 

labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements work stoppages including strikes could ensue depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions our operating expenses could increase significantly which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types 

of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

 

we may experience problems with either the operation of our current information technology systems or the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved we encountered problems with the new revenue management application that we had been piloting throughout 2007 resulting in the termination of the pilot while we determine how to proceed on an enterprisewide basis the termination of the pilot may lead to additional costs and expenses which could be material additionally the delay in implementing a new enterprisewide revenue management system may negatively affect our ability to improve our operating margins finally there can be no assurances that our issues related to the licensed application will not ultimately result in an impairment charge which could be material 

 

additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable law and regulations 

 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods 

 

unforeseen circumstances could result in a need for additional capital 

 

we currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures acquisitions and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary additional financings however materially adverse events could reduce our cash flows from operations our board of directors has approved a capital allocation program that provides for up to 14 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases during 2008 and recently announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments when declared by the board of directors to be 027 per share if our cash flows from operations were negatively affected we could be forced to reduce capital expenditures acquisition activity share repurchase activity or dividend declarations in these circumstances we instead may elect to incur more indebtedness if we made such an election there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable terms in these circumstances we would likely use our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs 

 

in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december 31 2007 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

our pricing program cost control measures and fixorseek exit initiatives continued to provide earnings growth margin expansion and strong free cash flow in 2007 despite volume losses resulting from pricing competition and an economic softening particularly in the residential construction sector our 2007 operating results were strong 

 

we improved our income from operations in 2007 by 225 million or 11 as compared with 2006 in addition income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased by 17 percentage points in 2007 as compared with 2006 this earnings growth and margin expansion is a reflection of our continued focus on improving our cost structure and pricing each customer to provide profitable returns as well as significant returns provided by our recycling operations in 2007 largely due to a very strong market for recycling commodities 

 

our revenues in 2007 decreased by 53 million or 04 as compared with 2006 primarily as a result of volume declines and divestitures offset largely by increased yield from base business and higher recycling commodity prices the loss of revenue due to volume declines in 2007 has resulted primarily from pricing competition and a significant slowdown in residential construction across the united states 

 

in 2007 we decreased our operating expenses despite incurring 35 million in operating costs during the year for labor disputes in oakland and los angeles california in 2007 operating expenses decreased by 185 million or 22 and as a percentage of revenue declined by 12 percentage points as compared with 2006 our selling general and administrative expenses increased by 44 million or 32 as compared with 2006 primarily a result of higher costs associated with the implementation and execution of our strategic initiatives that we believe will improve operations and processes over the longterm 

our free cash flow increased in 2007 due to lower capital spending and increased proceeds from divestitures the effects of which were partially offset by lower net cash provided by operating activities our capital expenditures were less in 2007 than 2006 largely due to relatively high levels of fleet capital spending in 2006 to prepare for significant mandated changes in heavyduty truck engines that began in january 2007 the increase in proceeds from divestitures was a result of our continued fixorseek exit initiative we calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

we expect that in 2008 we may continue to face challenges related to volume losses as a result of general economic conditions and pricing competition however we are redirecting some of the focus in our sales department from the rightpricing of existing customers which has largely been completed to seeking out new customers that will provide profitable growth to our business throughout 2007 we continued to focus on building a trusted brand that stands for quality reliable service safety and environmental protection we plan to cultivate this reputation focus on quality customer service actively manage our capital requirements and scheduled debt repayments and grow our business with targeted acquisitions and other investments that will improve our current operations’ performance and enhance and expand our services we believe all of these measures will ensure our ability to return value to our shareholders 

 

technology update — for the last several years we have been introducing systems and technologies to improve our business processes and profitability we recently have successfully deployed our fastlane system an enterprisewide automated pointofsale system for management of scale house ticketing and our compass system a fleet maintenance system that automates many shop functions and tracks repairs we also are proceeding with pilots of onboard computer systems for our fleet collection operations and modules for our pricing program as part of our focus on technology in october 2005 we entered into agreements with a major software vendor to license its waste and recycling revenue management application and have the vendor implement the licensed software throughout the company on a fixed price basis in january 2007 we began a pilot test of the licensed application in one of our smaller market areas while the rest of our market areas continued to operate using our existing revenue management system the results of the pilot demonstrated to us that the licensed application would not work in the fourth quarter of 2007 we terminated the pilot and the pilot market area’s operations are being returned to our existing revenue management system although we have continued to press the vendor to provide a revenue management application that fulfills its obligations to the company our negotiations have not yet resulted in a satisfactory commitment from the vendor in march 2008 in an effort to avoid litigation we will mediate and attempt to resolve our disputes with the vendor therefore we will not be able to deploy a new revenue management system in the foreseeable future and we will continue to run our current system although it does not provide the benefits we were expecting to get from the licensed application however we may be able to make enhancements to our current system our plans to install a new revenue management system to make enhancements to our current system and to address the issues with the software vendor may result in cost increases each of which could negatively affect our future cash flow and earnings 

basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information 

 

accounting changes — fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 and fsp no 481 definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 48 — effective january 1 2007 we adopted fin 48 and fsp no 481 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in addition fin 48 provides guidance on the derecognition classification and disclosure of tax positions as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties fsp no 481 provides guidance associated with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit 

 

sfas no 123r — sharebased payment  — on january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  which requires compensation expense to be recognized for all sharebased payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant we adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which results in i the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of sfas no 123r for all sharebased awards granted or modified after december 31 2005 and ii the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation for all unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption 

 

refer to note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of these new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position 

 

reclassification of segment information  — in the first quarter of 2007 we realigned our eastern midwest and western group organizations to facilitate improved business execution we moved certain market areas in the eastern and midwest groups to the midwest and western groups respectively in addition in early 2007 we moved certain of our wmra operations to our western group to more closely align their recycling operations with the related collection transfer and disposal operations we have reflected the impact of these realignments for all periods presented to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our operations 

 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

 

in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities stockholders’ equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments and selfinsurance reserves and recoveries as described below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

landfills  — the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 143 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations 

 

landfill costs  — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill 

footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

 

final capping costs  — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

closure and postclosure costs  — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

remaining permitted airspace  — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

 

expansion airspace  — we include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met based on the facts and circumstances of a 

specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 54 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2007 18 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace eight of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because of a lack of community or political support that could impede the expansion process the remaining ten landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one or fiveyear requirements generally as a result of statespecific permitting procedures 

 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined an airspace utilization factor or auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste and anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate in addition the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill amortization we look at factors such as the waste stream geography and rate of compaction among others to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher final capping closure or postclosure rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

 

environmental remediation liabilities  — we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party or prp investigations settlements certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates and assumptions 

 

we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with 

respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

asset impairments  — our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization we review the carrying value of our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in order to assess whether a potential impairment exists the assets’ carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates and our estimates often vary from cash flows eventually realized impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or an actual thirdparty valuation if the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 

 

there are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below 

 

landfills  — certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry 

 

goodwill  — at least annually we assess whether goodwill is impaired we assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the carrying value of each group’s goodwill to its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of each group’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the group as a whole we rely on discounted cash flow analysis which requires significant judgments and estimates about the future operations of each group to develop our estimates of fair value additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that more likely than not the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired 

 

selfinsurance reserves and recoveries  — we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

results of operations 

 

operating revenues 

 

our operating revenues in 2007 were 133 billion compared with 134 billion in 2006 and 131 billion in 2005 we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western wheelabrator and wmra groups these six operating groups are our reportable segments shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our six operating groups and our other waste services 

 

 

 

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer wheelabrator and recycling services revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the weight volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site our wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam recycling revenue which is generated by our wmra group as well as recycling operations embedded in the operations of our four geographic operating groups generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees our “other” revenues include our inplant services methane gas operations portolet ® services and street and parking lot sweeping services intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements the mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

 

 

base business  — yield on base business reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer disposal and wastetoenergy operations exclusive of volume changes revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price increases but also i price decreases to retain customers ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii changes related to the overall mix of services which are due principally to the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided 

 

in both 2006 and 2007 our pricing excellence initiative was the primary contributor to our base business yield growth the increases in base business yield were driven by our collection operations which experienced substantial growth in every geographic operating group primarily as a result of our continued focus on pricing our services based on marketspecific factors including our costs in 2006 increased collection revenues due to pricing were partially offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes and in 2007 the increased collection revenues were more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes however we continue to find that in spite of collection volume declines increased yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs provide notable margin improvements and earnings expansion in our collection line of business 

 

throughout 2007 we experienced increases in revenue due to yield on base business from our pricing excellence initiatives at our transfer stations and the municipal solid waste special waste and construction and demolition waste streams at our landfills the increases in transfer station revenues in 2007 were the most significant in the eastern and western portions of the united states at our landfills municipal solid waste revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the south and east special waste revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the west and our construction and demolition revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the south 

 

revenues from our environmental fee which is included in base business yield were 121 million 76 million and 33 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

commodity  — recycling prices approached all time highs in 2007 and drove the substantial revenue growth from yield increases in the prices of the recycling commodities we process contributed 306 million of revenue growth in 2007 average prices for old corrugated cardboard increased by 62 and average prices for old newsprint increased by 39 in 2007 approximately 50 of the increase in revenue from yield on our recycling operations is associated with our relatively lower margin brokerage activities 

 

our revenues in 2006 declined 48 million as compared with the prior year due to price decreases in recycling commodities in 2006 average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by 8 and average prices for old newsprint were down by about 7 

fuel surcharges and mandated fees  — fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by 29 million in 2007 this increase is due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges we experienced relatively flat market prices for fuel for the first nine months of the year during the fourth quarter of 2007 we experienced a significantly higher increase in market prices for fuel which contributed all of the revenue increase due to fuel surcharges in 2007 

 

fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by 117 million for 2006 the substantial 2006 increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be attributed to i increases in market prices for fuel ii an increase in the number of customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program and iii the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors 

 

increases in our operating expenses due to higher diesel fuel prices include our direct fuel costs for our operations which are included in operating expenses — fuel  as well as estimated indirect fuel costs which are included primarily in operating expenses — subcontractor costs  

 

the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the passthrough of fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above 

 

volume  — the declines in our revenues due to lower volumes when comparing 2007 and 2006 with the corresponding prior year periods have been driven by declines in our collection volumes and to a lesser extent lower transfer station and thirdparty disposal volumes 

 

volume reductions in 2007 have significantly affected the revenues of each of our collection lines of business in each geographic operating group our industrial collection operations have experienced the most significant revenue declines due to lower volumes reduced volumes continue to be significantly affected by our focus on improving margins through increased pricing volume declines in our industrial collection business have also been affected by the significant slowdown in residential construction across the united states our commercial and residential collection operations have experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes in each geographic group as well 

 

declines in revenue due to lower thirdparty volumes in our transfer station operations have been the most notable in our eastern group and can generally be attributed to the effects of pricing in 2007 we also experienced declines in thirdparty revenue at our landfills due to reduced disposal volumes the most significant declines were in our construction and demolition waste particularly in our southern group the reduction in construction and demolition volumes was largely due to the significant slowdown in residential construction across the united states the volume declines for our municipal solid waste disposal operations have been the most significant in our midwest group due primarily to our focus on pricing increases wastetoenergy revenue from disposal volumes also declined in 2007 largely due to the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in may 2007 the revenue decline due to lower thirdparty volumes in our recycling business was primarily attributable to decreases in certain brokerage activities and the closure of a plastics processing facility 

 

the revenue declines in our collection businesses in 2006 were partially offset by increased disposal volumes in all of our geographic operating groups through the first nine months of the year our special waste municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste streams were the primary drivers of this growth in revenues due to higher volumes we believe that the strength of the economy throughout most of the year and favorable weather in many parts of the country were the primary drivers of the higher disposal volumes in the fourth quarter of 2006 we experienced a decline in disposal volumes as compared with the fourth quarter of 2005 which we believe was due to the lack of hurricane volumes in 2006 competition impacts of our pricing initiatives and an economic softening that caused a significant decline in residential construction 

 

divestitures  — divestitures of underperforming and nonstrategic operations accounted for decreased revenues of 320 million in 2007 and 154 million in 2006 these divestitures were primarily comprised of collection operations and to a lesser extent transfer station and recycling operations 

operating expenses 

 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are driven by transportation costs such as fuel prices v costs of goods sold which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include landfill remediation costs leachate and methane collection and treatment other landfill site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement obligations ix risk management costs which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent and property taxes 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

the decreases in operating expenses for both 2007 and 2006 as compared with the prior year periods can be attributed primarily to i our efforts to maximize margin expansion by focusing on managing our fixed costs and reducing our variable costs ii the divestiture of underperforming and low margin businesses and iii volume declines due to our pricing program and the slowdown in residential construction in 2007 our cost containment efforts had the most significant impact on our risk management and maintenance and repair costs while the impact of divestitures and volume declines provided significant reductions in transfer disposal and subcontractor costs the operating expense declines during 2007 were partially offset by increased “cost of goods sold” due to significantly higher commodity prices and “other” operating expenses incurred for labor disputes in oakland and los angeles california these expenses are discussed below 

 

in addition to lowering overall costs the last two years our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 12 percentage points for 2007 from 643 in 2006 to 631 in 2007 building on the improvement of 17 percentage points during 2006 the improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects our continued focus on identifying operational efficiencies that translate into cost savings revenue growth on base business yield shedding low margin volumes and divesting operations that are not improving 

 

as discussed above the changes in our “operating” expenses when comparing 2007 2006 and 2005 can largely be attributed to our focus on cost control volume declines and divestitures overall these favorable items have been slightly offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in canadian currency exchange rates however there 

are several additional items that affect the comparability of our operating expenses by category for the periods presented these additional items are summarized by category below 

 

labor and related benefits  — in each year wage increases due to annual merit adjustments have partially offset cost reductions due to headcount reductions related to operating efficiencies divestitures and volume declines during 2006 bonus expense was higher than either 2007 or 2005 due to the outperformance of 2006 incentive plan measures the company’s performance in both 2007 and 2005 was more in line with established incentive plan targets 

 

transfer and disposal costs  — in addition to the impacts of divestitures and volume declines the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at thirdparty transfer stations or landfills have declined due to our focus on improving internalization 

 

maintenance and repairs  — throughout 2006 and 2007 cost savings were generated from i various fleet initiatives targeted at improving our maintenance practices while reducing maintenance parts and supplies costs and ii changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our wastetoenergy facilities in 2006 yearoveryear reductions due to divestitures volume declines and the items previously noted were outweighed by increased labor costs 

 

subcontractor costs  — during the fourth quarter of 2007 and throughout 2006 we experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to thirdparty subcontractors these cost increases were offset in part by the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program which is reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues  additionally in 2006 we incurred significant subcontractor costs during the first quarter of 2006 to assist in providing hurricane related services 

 

cost of goods sold  — fluctuations in these costs are generally based on changes in our recycling revenues because they are primarily related to rebates we pay to our recycling suppliers when comparing 2007 with 2006 substantially higher market prices for recyclable commodities resulted in significant revenue growth and higher cost of goods sold when comparing 2006 with 2005 these costs were lower due to a decrease in market prices for recyclable commodities and reduced recycling volumes additionally in 2006 the decrease in costs of goods sold was partially due to the completion of the construction of an integrated waste facility in canada in early 2006 

 

fuel  — we experienced an estimated average increase of 018 per gallon for 2007 as compared with 2006 and of 031 per gallon for 2006 as compared with 2005 fuel costs were relatively constant through the first nine months of 2007 but increased sharply during the fourth quarter while our fuel surcharge is designed to respond to changes in the market price for fuel the sharp increase late in 2007 negatively affected our ability to recover increased costs resulting from higher fuel prices within the year due to a lag in the timing of increased revenues following fuel cost increases in each year increased fuel costs have negatively affected our operating margin percentages revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues 

 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes  — in 2007 these cost declines were partially due to the resolution of a disposal tax matter in our eastern group which resulted in the recognition of 18 million in favorable adjustments to operating costs during 2007 in 2006 we experienced increases in rates for mandated fees and taxes in certain markets certain of these cost increases are passed through to our customers and have been reflected as fee yield increases within operating revenues 

 

landfill operating costs  — these costs increased during 2007 due to charges for revisions in our estimates associated with remediation obligations and changes in the riskfree discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of these obligations during 2007 we recorded an 8 million charge to reduce the discount rate from 475 to 400 and during 2006 we recorded a 6 million decrease in expense to reflect an increase in the rate from 425 to 475 for 2006 the cost increases as compared with 2005 generally related to higher site maintenance leachate collection monitoring and testing and closure and postclosure expenses 

 

risk management  — over the last two years we have been increasingly successful in reducing these costs which can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates for 2007 the decrease in expense was largely associated with reduced actuarial projections of auto and general liability claims and to a lesser extent reduced workers’ compensation costs during 2006 the decline in expenses as compared with 2005 was primarily due to reduced workers’ compensation costs 

other operating expenses  — in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we incurred a significant increase in “other” expenses due in large part to costs incurred for labor disputes with the teamsters local 70 in oakland california that was resolved in july 2007 and with teamsters local 396 in los angeles that was resolved in october 2007 these labor disputes negatively affected the “income from operations” of our western group by 37 million including 33 million of additional “other” operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 the increased operating costs were primarily related to security and the deployment and lodging costs incurred for the company’s replacement workers who were brought to california from across the organization for the year ended december 31 2006 our eastern group incurred 14 million for similar costs which were primarily for a labor strike in the new york city area 

 

also affecting the comparability of our “other” operating expenses for 2007 as compared with 2006 were i 21 million of lease termination costs incurred during the first quarter of 2007 associated with the purchase of one of our independent power production plants that had previously been operated through a lease agreement ii lower lease and rental expenses in 2007 and iii an increase in gains recognized on the sales of assets for 2007 

 

the lower costs in 2006 as compared with 2005 can be attributed to i hurricane katrina related support costs in 2005 particularly in louisiana where we built camp waste management to house and feed employees who worked in the new orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts ii comparatively higher rental expense in 2005 and iii a decrease related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in early 2006 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunication advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing in addition the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling general and administrative expenses 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

our labor and related benefits professional fees and other general and administrative costs for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by 24 million as a result of noncapitalizable costs associated with investments in our information technology and our people strategies other significant changes in our selling general and administrative expenses are summarized below 

 

labor and related benefits  — in both 2007 and 2006 these costs increased yearoveryear due to higher compensation costs driven by an increase in the size of our sales force increased investments in our information technology and people strategies as noted above higher noncash compensation expense associated with the equitybased compensation provided for by our longterm incentive plan and annual merit raises the higher labor costs for our pricing people and other initiatives are necessary as we implement new ways to grow our business and strengthen our ongoing operations our bonus expenses were relatively higher in 2006 than either 2005 or 2007 due to the strength of our performance against incentive plan measures in that year fluctuations in our use of contract labor for corporate support functions also caused an increase in 2006 as compared with 2005 these cost increases in 2006 were partially offset by savings associated with our 2005 restructuring 

 

professional fees  — in both 2007 and 2006 our consulting fees increased as a result of our strategic initiatives in 2007 this increase was offset by i lower consulting costs associated with our pricing initiatives and 

ii reductions in legal fees and expenses largely as a result of higher costs in 2006 related to indemnification obligations for former officers in legacy litigation brought by the sec 

 

other  — our “selling general and administrative” expenses for the years ended 2007 and 2006 included net charges of approximately 2 million and 20 million respectively to record our estimated obligations for unclaimed property refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the nature of these charges 

 

additionally in both 2007 and 2006 our other costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs and higher travel and entertainment costs due partially to the development of our revenue management system and our efforts to implement various initiatives 

 

depreciation and amortization 

 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded due to capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction asset retirement costs arising from closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

 

depreciation and amortization expense was 1259 million or 95 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 1334 million or 100 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 and 1361 million or 104 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 the 75 million decrease when comparing 2007 with 2006 can be attributed in part to landfill volume declines the 27 million decrease when comparing 2006 with 2005 was primarily due to the suspension of depreciation on assets heldforsale and divestitures additonally in both 2007 and 2006 there were decreases in depreciation due to components of enterprisewide software becoming fully depreciated 

 

the comparability of our depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 has also been significantly affected by i a 21 million charge to landfill amortization recognized in 2005 to adjust the amortization periods of nine of our leased landfills and ii adjustments to landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 landfill amortization expense was reduced by 17 million 1 million and 13 million respectively for the effects of these changes in estimates in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes 

 

restructuring 

 

management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure our 2007 and 2005 restructurings were the result of reviews that highlighted opportunities for efficiencies and cost savings the most significant cost savings we have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “selling general and administrative” expenses 

 

in the first quarter of 2007 we restructured certain operations and functions resulting in the recognition of a charge of approximately 9 million we incurred an additional 1 million of costs for this restructuring during the second quarter of 2007 increasing the costs incurred to date to 10 million approximately 7 million of our restructuring costs was incurred by our corporate organization 2 million was incurred by our midwest group and 1 million was incurred by our western group these charges included approximately 8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and approximately 2 million related to operating lease agreements 

 

during the third quarter of 2005 we reorganized and simplified our organizational structure by eliminating certain support functions performed at the group or corporate office we also eliminated the canadian group office which reduced the number of our operating groups from seven to six this reorganization reduced costs at 

the group and corporate offices and increased the accountability of our market areas we recorded 28 million of pretax charges in 2005 for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure principally for employee severance and benefit costs 

 

income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 

 

income expense from divestitures including heldforsale impairments  — the net gains from divestitures in all three years were a result of our fixorseek exit initiative and 2005 also included a 39 million gain from the divestiture of a landfill in canada as a result of a divestiture order by the competition bureau gains recognized from divestitures in 2006 were partially offset by the recognition of aggregate impairment charges of 18 million for operations held for sale as required by sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  

 

impairments of assets heldforuse  — during 2007 we recognized 12 million in impairment charges due to impairments recognized for two landfills in our southern group the impairments were necessary as a result of the reevaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for the second landfill 

 

the 24 million of impairment charges recognized during 2006 was primarily related to the impairment of a landfill in our eastern group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the impairment of underperforming operations in our wmra group 

 

during the second quarter of 2005 our eastern group recorded a 35 million charge for the impairment of the pottstown landfill in pennsylvania we determined that the impairment was necessary after the denial of a permit application for a vertical expansion at the landfill was upheld and we decided not to pursue an appeal of that decision in addition during 2005 we recorded 68 million in impairment charges associated with capitalized software driven by a 59 million charge for revenue management system software that had previously been under development the remaining impairment charges recognized in 2005 were largely related to the impairment of a landfill in our eastern group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions 

 

other  — in both 2006 and 2005 we recognized charges associated with the termination of legal matters related to issues that arose in 2000 and earlier in 2006 we recognized a 26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000 in 2005 we recognized a 16 million charge for the impact of a settlement reached with a group of stockholders that had opted not to participate in the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998 and 1999 activity and a 27 million charge to settle our ongoing defense costs associated with possible indemnity obligations to former officers of wm holdings related to the litigation brought against them by the sec the 2005 charges were partially offset by the recognition of a net benefit of 12 million primarily for adjustments to receivables and estimated obligations for nonsolid waste operations that had been sold in 1999 and 2000 

income from operations by reportable segment 

 

the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 and provides explanations of significant factors contributing to the identified variances in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

operating segments  — increased yield on base business as a result of our pricing strategies our continued focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies and highermargin disposal volumes have improved the operating income of our geographic groups each year during the threeyear period ended december 31 2007 base business yield provided revenue growth for each line of business in 2007 and in 2006 and was driven primarily by our collection operations where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating group for the third consecutive year the improvements in operating income have been partially offset by the effects of declines in revenues due to lower volumes which generally are the result of pricing competition as well as the significant downturn in residential construction and the slowdown of the general economic environment in 2007 see additional discussion in the operating revenues section above 

 

other significant items affecting the comparability of the operating segments’ results of operations for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 are summarized below 

 

eastern  — the group’s operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 includes i net divestiture gains of 33 million ii an 18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter and iii a reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations the group’s operating income for the year ended december 31 2006 was negatively affected by 26 million in charges associated with i the impairment of businesses being sold as part of our divestiture program and ii the impairment of a landfill the year ended december 31 2005 was negatively affected by the recognition of 44 million in impairment charges related primarily to the pottstown landfill finally the operating results of our eastern group for 2006 and 2005 were negatively affected by costs incurred in connection with labor strikes for the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 14 million of costs related primarily to a strike in the new york city area the group incurred similar costs during the first quarter of 2005 for a labor strike in new jersey which decreased operating income for the year ended december 31 2005 by approximately 9 million 

 

midwest  — positively affecting operating results in 2007 and in 2005 were reductions in landfill amortization expense resulting from changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations 

 

southern  — during 2007 the group recorded 12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of its landfills these charges were offset by gains on divestitures of 11 million during 2005 several large nonrecurring type items were recognized impacting comparisons to the other periods presented these items include 13 million of pretax gains recognized on the divestiture of operations during 2005 and declines in earnings related to i hurricanes largely due to the temporary suspension of operations in the areas affected by hurricane katrina ii the effects of higher landfill amortization costs generally due to reductions in landfill 

amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations and iii higher landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations 

 

western  — the group’s 2007 operating results were negatively affected by 37 million as a result of various labor disputes which are discussed in the operating expenses section above gains on divestitures of operations were 16 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared with 48 million for 2006 and 24 million for 2005 

 

wheelabrator  — the decline in operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 was driven by a 21 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007 for the early termination of a lease agreement the early termination was due to the group’s purchase of an independent power production plant that it had previously operated through a lease agreement additionally the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in may 2007 resulted in a decline in revenue and operating income compared with the prior years 

 

wmra  — the group’s 2007 operating income has benefited from substantial increases in market prices for commodities and 7 million of net gains on divestitures in addition the group has experienced significant returns from operational improvements including an increased focus on maintaining or reducing rebates made to suppliers during 2006 the group recognized 10 million of charges for a loss from a divestiture and an impairment of certain underperforming operations which were slightly more than offset by savings associated with the group’s cost control efforts income from operations in our wmra group during 2005 includes costs related to the deployment of new software 

 

significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 are summarized below 

 

other  — the changes in operating results for the periods presented are largely related to certain yearend adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed the unfavorable change in operating results in 2007 when compared with 2006 can also be attributed in part to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in april 2006 the favorable operating results in 2005 were also significantly affected by a 39 million pretax gain resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in ontario canada this impact is included in “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” within our consolidated statement of operations as this landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005 reorganization historical financial information associated with its operations has not been allocated to our remaining reportable segments accordingly these impacts have been included in other 

 

corporate and other  — in 2007 and 2006 we experienced significantly lower risk management costs largely due to our focus on safety and controlling costs other significant items occurring in 2007 include i a reduction in expenses from the discontinuation of depreciation for certain enterprisewide software that is now fully depreciated ii increased spending on the support and development of our information technology people and pricing strategic initiatives iii increased labor and related benefits costs and iv restructuring charges 

 

when comparing 2006 operating results with 2005 in addition to lower risk management costs we experienced lower employee health and welfare plan costs also as a result of our focus on controlling costs these cost savings were largely offset by i a 20 million charge recorded to recognize unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property which is discussed in the selling general and administrative section above ii increased incentive compensation expense iii higher consulting fees and sales commissions primarily related to our pricing initiatives iv an increase in our marketing costs due to our national advertising campaign v the centralization of support functions that were provided by our group offices prior to our 2005 reorganization and vi a 26 million charge associated with an arbitration ruling against us related to a joint venture relationship that terminated in 2000 

 

our 2005 operating results include impairment charges of 68 million associated with capitalized software costs and 31 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters also contributing to expenses during 2005 were costs at corporate associated with our july 2005 restructuring charge and other organizational changes which were partially offset by the associated savings at corporate 

other components of net income 

 

the following table summarizes the other major components of our income for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

interest expense 

 

the variances in interest expense during the reported periods are generally related to i decreases in our outstanding debt balances due to our repayment of borrowings throughout 2006 and 2007 ii the maturity of higher rate debt that we have effectively refinanced at lower interest rates and ii fluctuations in market interest rates which influence the impacts of our interest rate swaps and the interest rates of our variable rate debt 

 

we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates the combined impact of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in a net interest expense increase of 11 million for 2007 and 4 million for 2006 for the year ended december 31 2005 interest rate swaps reduced net interest expense by 39 million the significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our active interest rate swap agreements is attributable to the increase in shortterm market interest rates our periodic interest obligations under our active interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from the threemonth libor which has varied significantly during the threeyear period ended december 31 2007 specifically the threemonth libor was as low as 275 in early 2005 and as high as 562 in the second half of 2007 included in the 11 million net increase in interest expense realized in 2007 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is a 37 million reduction in interest expense related to the amortization of terminated swaps our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by 33 million in 2008 19 million in 2009 and 12 million in 2010 

 

interest income 

 

in 2007 decreases in our average cash and investment balances on a yearoveryear basis resulted in a decline in interest income in addition interest income for 2006 included interest income of 14 million realized on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits when comparing 2006 with 2005 the increase in interest income was due to the 2006 tax refund and an increase in our investments in variable rate demand notes and auction rate securities throughout the year 

 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

 

our “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” is primarily related to our equity interests in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities our equity in the losses of these facilities was 42 million for the year ended december 31 2007 41 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and 112 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the equity losses generated by the facilities are offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for benefit from income taxes 

 

our equity in the losses of the facilities in both 2007 and 2006 have been significantly affected by our expectations for a partial phaseout of section 45k credits on our contractual obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses the irs has not yet published the phaseout percentage that must be applied to section 45k tax credits generated in 2007 accordingly we have used market information for oil prices to estimate that we expect 69 of section 45k tax credits generated in 2007 to be phasedout the irs establishment of the final phaseout of 

section 45k credits generated during 2007 could further impact the equity in losses of the facilities we recognized for 2007 any subsequent adjustment to the amount of realizable section 45k credits and related equity losses will be reflected in our 2008 consolidated financial statements 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had estimated that 36 of section 45k tax credits generated during 2006 would be phased out on april 4 2007 the irs established the final phaseout of section 45k credits generated during 2006 at approximately 33 we did not experience any phaseout of section 45k tax credits in 2005 

 

in addition the facilities temporarily suspended operations in may 2006 reducing our obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses for the year ended december 31 2006 during the second quarter of 2006 we also recognized a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately reflect our lifetodate obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and the value of our investment 

 

minority interest 

 

on december 31 2003 we consolidated two limited liability companies that own three wastetoenergy facilities operated by our wheelabrator group as a result of our implementation of fin 46r our minority interest expense for 2007 2006 and 2005 is primarily related to the other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities additional information related to these investments is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 540 million in 2007 and 325 million in 2006 and a benefit from income taxes of 90 million in 2005 these tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 317 221 and 82 for each of the three years respectively the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 is primarily affected by i increases in our income before taxes and ii differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements and nonconventional fuel tax credits which are discussed in more detail below other items that have affected our reported income taxes during the reported periods include the following 

 

  

the impacts of tax audit settlements and nonconventional fuel tax credits which are the items that had the most significant impacts on the comparability of our effective tax rate during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 are summarized below 

 

 40 

  

nonconventional fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2007 pursuant to section 45k of the internal revenue code accordingly at current income levels we expect that our 2008 effective tax rate will be approximately 40 without the benefit of the tax credits 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet iii construction refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills and vi repaying debt and discharging other obligations we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business 

 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 allowed us companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005 our chief executive officer and board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated 496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005 the repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings for a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

summary of cash shortterm investments restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

 

the following is a summary of our cash shortterm investments available for use restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 in millions 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less 

 

shortterm investments available for use  — periodically we have invested in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes which are debt instruments with longterm scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates the interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic remarketing of the underlying securities through an auction process due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the shortterm nature of our investment in these securities they have been classified as current assets in our consolidated balance sheets due to the decline in our overall cash balances near the end of 2007 we did not hold any of these investments as of december 31 2007 

 

restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of our debt obligations funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill closure postclosure and environmental remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

 

debt  — we use longterm borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business we primarily use senior notes and taxexempt bonds to borrow on a longterm basis but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate the components of our longterm borrowings as of december 31 2007 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

changes in our outstanding debt balances from december 31 2006 to december 31 2007 can primarily be attributed to i the cash repayment of 1200 million of outstanding borrowings at their scheduled maturities ii 944 million of cash borrowings generally to refinance amounts repaid in cash during the year iii noncash proceeds from taxexempt borrowings net of principal payments made directly from trust funds of 144 million iv a 53 million increase in the carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps and v the impacts of accounting for other noncash changes in our balances due to foreign currency translation interest and capital leases 

 

we have approximately 12 billion of scheduled debt maturities during the next twelve months we have classified approximately 840 million of these borrowings as longterm as of december 31 2007 based on our intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis 

 

summary of cash flow activity 

 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities — the comparability of our operating cash flows for the periods presented is affected by our adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 sfas no 123r requires reductions in income taxes payable attributable to excess tax benefits associated with equitybased transactions to be included in cash flows from financing activities which are discussed below prior to adopting sfas no 123r our excess tax benefits associated with equitybased transactions were included within cash flows from operating activities as a change in “accounts payable and accrued liabilities” during 2005 these excess tax benefits improved our operating cash flows by approximately 17 million 

 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below 

 

 42 

 

  

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below 

 

  

net cash used in investing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

 43 

 

  

net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

  

in december 2007 our board of directors approved a new capital allocation program that includes the authorization for up to 14 billion in combined cash dividends and common stock repurchases in 2008 approximately 184 million of the additional authorization of 300 million in november 2007 was not used in 2007 as a result the maximum amount of capital to be allocated to our share repurchases and dividend payments in 2008 is 1584 million we currently intend to allocate up to 14 billion of capital to dividends and share repurchases in 2008 

 

we paid 1421 million for share repurchases in 2007 as compared with 1072 million in 2006 and 706 million in 2005 we repurchased approximately 40 million 31 million and 25 million shares of our common stock in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above 

 

we paid an aggregate of 495 million in cash dividends during 2007 compared with 476 million in 2006 and 449 million in 2005 the increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from 020 in 2005 to 022 in 2006 and to 024 in 2007 the impact of the yearoveryear increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase program in december 2007 the board of directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be 027 per share all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant

summary of contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

 

 

 

 46 

 

we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely as a result the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements our thirdparty guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2007 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

 

seasonal trends and inflation 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005 can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when waste flows are generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of fuel have affected our operating margins in recent periods we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 will be effective for the company beginning january 1 2008 we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 157 on january 1 2008 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however we are continuing to assess the potential effects of sfas no 157 as additional guidance becomes available 

 

sfas no 159 — fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2007 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider creditworthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 

 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 

 

interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are primarily denominated in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations which directly impacts variability in interest costs an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately 445 million at december 31 2007 and 460 million at december 31 2006 this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 

 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have 418 million and 377 million of assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure postclosure and environmental remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

 

currency rate exposure from time to time we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign 

currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the company 

 

commodities price exposure we market recycled products such as wastepaper aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities we have entered into commodity swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales under the swap agreements we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time with regard to our option agreements we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors put options and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings call options additionally we have entered into collars combination of a put and call option with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling we record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings as required the fair value position of our commodity derivatives is not material to our financial position at december 31 2007 and 2006

 item 1   business tableend  

general 

 

the financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary waste management inc is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wmi” we are referring only to the parent holding company 

 

we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america using our vast network of assets and employees we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services through our subsidiaries we provide collection transfer recycling disposal and wastetoenergy services in providing these services we actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment including recovering and processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities during 2006 none of our customers accounted for more than 1 of our operating revenue we employed approximately 48000 people as of december 31 2006 

 

our company’s goals are targeted at serving five key stakeholders our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our shareholders our goals are 

 

  

wmi was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the illinoisbased waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wmi and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent holding company changed its name from usa waste services to waste management inc like wmi wm holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries 

 

our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street suite 4000 houston texas 77002 our telephone number at that address is 713 5126200 our website address is httpwwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wmi” 

 

strategy 

 

in 2006 we continued working on our longterm goals of improving our organization and maximizing returns to our shareholders by concentrating on operational excellence profitability and growing our business our current strategies are based on four objectives revenue growth through pricing lowering operating and selling general and administrative costs through process standardization and productivity improvements improving our portfolio of business units through our “fix or seek exit” strategy and generating strong and consistent cash flow from operations that can be returned to shareholders 

revenue growth 

 

our revenue growth through pricing excellence objective centers around attaining a return on invested capital that appropriately considers our cost of capital the risks we take in our business and the value of our disposal assets we have been using an increasingly more disciplined approach to pricing where we carefully analyze our operations and make decisions based on market specific information in addition we are rolling out comprehensive fee programs that are designed to recover the costs we incur for items such as collection of past due balances container deliveries and infrequent pickups we believe our success in increasing internal revenue growth from yield is a direct result of our pricing objectives 

 

cost control 

 

we remain committed to finding the best practices throughout our organization and standardizing those practices and processes throughout the company in 2006 we were able to reduce our operating expenses for the first time in several years demonstrating the progress we are making on our operational excellence initiatives such as improving productivity reducing fleet maintenance costs standardizing operating practices and improving safety as well as our divestiture of underperforming operations which is discussed below 

 

we also believe that we must make investments in our business that will provide for longerterm cost savings and efficiencies during 2006 we have made significant investments in our information technology our people and our pricing strategies certain costs associated with these investments have increased our selling general and administrative costs but are being incurred to provide longterm returns the most noteworthy investment we made in 2006 relates to our new revenue management software during the last year we focused on tailoring this revenue management software to our business and processes so that when implemented it will provide our employees with the information resources they need to serve our customers more effectively and efficiently this implementation process will continue to be a focus of our people in 2007 

 

improve operations through divestitures acquisitions and investments 

 

in the third quarter of 2005 we announced that our board of directors had approved a plan to divest underperforming and nonstrategic operations as of december 31 2006 we had divested operations representing annual gross revenues of over 235 million the ultimate sale of any of the operations identified for divestiture is dependent on several factors including identifying interested purchasers negotiating the terms and conditions of the sales and obtaining regulatory approvals we believe that we have made significant progress in 2006 in executing our “fix or seek exit” strategy 

 

in addition to our focus on divesting underperforming operations we continue to look for acquisitions and other investments to improve our current operations’ performance and enhance and expand our services in particular we intend to make investments in our landfill gastoenergy programs as well as other purchases that we believe will benefit future expansion efforts all of which are complementary to our existing operations 

 

return value to shareholders 

 

we continue to use the cash that we generate not only to reinvest in our business but also to return value to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividend payments our current threeyear capital allocation program authorizes up to 12 billion of combined stock repurchases and dividend payments for each of 2005 2006 and 2007 our board of directors approved an additional 350 million for stock repurchases in 2006 accordingly we repurchased over 1 billion of our common stock and paid dividends of 476 million in 2006 we recently announced that our board of directors expects that future quarterly dividend payments will be increased to 024 per share although our board of directors must first declare each dividend payment this will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the fourth straight year 

 

operations 

 

general 

 

we are the leading provider of integrated waste services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers throughout the united states puerto rico and canada our core business includes collection transfer recycling disposal and wastetoenergy services we manage and evaluate our operations through six operating groups of which four are organized by geographic area and two are organized by function the geographic groups include our eastern midwest southern and western groups and the two functional groups are our wheelabrator group which provides wastetoenergy services and our recycling group we also provide additional waste management services that are not managed through our six groups these services include onsite services methane gas recovery and thirdparty subcontracted and administrative services managed by our national accounts and upstream organizations and are presented in this report as “other” 

 

the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2006 more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 

 

 

the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wheelabrator wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

 

 

 

collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to a transfer station or disposal site we generally provide collection services under two types of arrangements 

 

 3 

  

  

landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america and we have the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are built and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are operated under prescribed procedures a landfill must be maintained to meet federal state or provincial and local regulations the operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes 

 

all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill we believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using thirdparty disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

 

we also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under federal environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform wastes into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous wastes in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

 

we owned or operated 277 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 the landfills that we operate but do not own are generally operated under a lease agreement or an operating contract the differences between the two arrangements usually relate to the owner of the landfill operating permit generally with a lease agreement the permit is in our name and we operate the landfill for its entire life making payments to the lessor who is generally a private landowner based either on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received we are generally responsible for closure and postclosure requirements under our lease agreements for operating contracts the owner of the property generally a municipality usually owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term which may be the life of the landfill the property owner is generally responsible for closure and postclosure obligations under our operating contracts 

 

based on remaining permitted airspace as defined within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions  as of december 31 2006 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 28 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond 

what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are currently seeking expansion permits at 62 of our landfills for which we consider expansions to be likely although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 35 years when considering remaining permitted airspace expansion airspace as defined within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates and assumptions  and projected annual disposal volume at december 31 2006 and 2005 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 

 

 

the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 in millions

the number of landfills we own or operate segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume as of december 31 2006 was as follows 

 

 

 

the volume of waste as measured in tons that we received in 2006 and 2005 at all of our landfills is shown below in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

when a landfill we own or operate i reaches its permitted waste capacity ii is permanently capped and iii receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency management of the site including for any remediation activities is generally transferred to our closed sites management group in addition to the 283 active landfills we managed at december 31 2006 we also managed 187 closed landfills 

 

transfer at december 31 2006 we owned or operated 342 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other thirdparty waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

 

access to transfer stations is often critical to thirdparty haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in close proximity to their collection operations fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

 

the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our disposal sites 

 

the transfer stations that we operate but do not own are generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under 

contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for all of the regulatory requirements in accordance with the lease and operating agreements terms 

 

wheelabrator as of december 31 2006 we owned or operated 17 wastetoenergy facilities and five independent power production plants “ipps” that are located in the northeast and in florida california and washington 

 

at our wastetoenergy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam which is either sold or used to generate electricity our wastetoenergy facilities are capable of processing up to 24000 tons of solid waste each day in both 2006 and 2005 our wastetoenergy facilities received 78 million tons of solid waste or approximately 21300 tons per day 

 

our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam which is either sold or used to generate electricity the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

 

our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps sell steam to industrial and commercial users steam that is not sold is used to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities fees at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps are generally subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts interim adjustments to the prices for steam and electricity under these longterm contracts are made for changes in market conditions such as inflation natural gas prices and other general market factors 

 

recycling our recycling group focuses on improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs within communities and industries in addition to our recycling group our four geographic operating groups provide certain recycling services that are embedded within the groups’ other operations and therefore not included within the recycling group’s financial results 

 

recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

 

collection and materials processing  — through our collection operations we collect recyclable materials from residential commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our material recovery facilities “mrfs” for processing we operate 108 mrfs where paper glass metals plastics and compost are recovered for resale we also operate five secondary processing facilities where materials received from mrfs can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods specifically material processing services include data destruction automated color sorting and construction and demolition processing 

 

plastics and rubber materials recycling  — using stateoftheart sorting and processing technology we process inventory and sell plastic and rubber commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient 

 

electronics recycling services  — we provide an innovative customized approach to recycling discarded computers communications equipment and other electronic equipment services include the collection sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials 

 

commodities recycling  — we market and resell recyclable commodities to customers worldwide we manage the marketing of recyclable commodities for our own facilities and for third parties by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices logistics market demands and product quality 

 

during 2005 and 2006 we also provided glass recycling services however we divested of our glass recycling facilities in 2006 as part of our continued focus on improving the profitability of our business 

 

recycling fees are influenced by frequency of collection type and volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

 

our recycling group purchases recyclable materials processed in our mrfs from various sources including third parties and other operating subsidiaries of wmi the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the finished goods to our customers the price our recycling group pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” and is based upon the price we receive for sales of finished goods and local market conditions as a result higher commodity prices increase our revenues and increase the rebates we pay to our suppliers 

 

other we provide onsite services in which we outsource our employees to provide full service waste management to customers at their plants and other facilities through our upstream division our vertically integrated waste management operations allow us to provide customers with full management of their waste including identifying recycling opportunities minimizing their waste determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and transporting and disposing of their waste 

 

we also develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the united states environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources we actively pursue landfill gas beneficial use projects and at december 31 2006 we were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 104 of our solid waste landfills at 76 of these landfills the processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 23 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes such as steam boilers cement kilns and utility plants at five landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

 

in addition we rent and service portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  and provide street and parking lot sweeping services from time to time we are also contracted to construct waste facilities on behalf of third parties 

 

competition 

 

the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies private solid waste companies large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private wastetoenergy companies we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills the municipalities and regional governmental authorities are often able to offer lower direct charges to the customer for the same service by subsidizing the cost of the service through the use of tax revenues and taxexempt financing generally however municipalities do not provide significant commercial and industrial collection or waste disposal 

 

we compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other companies own or operate their own landfills to which they will send their waste we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and quality of services operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites the availability of airspace within the geographic region labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition based on quality of service and pricing under certain customer service contracts our ability to increase our prices or pass on cost increases to our customers may be limited from time to time competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2006 we had approximately 48000 fulltime employees of which approximately 7600 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 12500 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

 

financial assurance 

 

municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require the contracting party to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits various forms of financial assurance are also required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure postclosure and remedial obligations at many of our landfills in addition certain of our taxexempt borrowings require us to hold funds in trust for the repayment of our interest and principal obligations 

 

we establish financial assurance in different ways including surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees the instrument decision is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of credit capacity the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

 

 9 

 

  

the assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established other than these permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

 

insurance 

 

we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy our general liability insurance program has a per incident deductible of 25 million and our workers’ compensation and auto insurance programs each have per incident deductibles of 1 million effective january 1 2007 we increased the per incident deductible for our workers’ compensation insurance program to 15 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2006 are summarized in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

regulation 

 

our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the epa and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

 

because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we 

must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain necessary required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain necessary governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

 

the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 

 11 

  

the epa has issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal wastetoenergy facilities which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on maximum achievable control technology “mact” standards these sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under title v of the clean air act the clean air act requires the epa to review and revise the mact standards applicable to municipal wastetoenergy facilities every five years 

 

  

there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are stricter than comparable federal laws and regulations when not otherwise preempted by federal law additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling 

 

various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance was unconstitutional however other courts have refused to apply the supreme court precedent in various circumstances in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste these congressional efforts have to date been unsuccessful the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level or the courts’ interpretation or validation of flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid waste management services 

 

many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of regulations on our current and future operations 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in an effort to keep our shareholders and the public informed about our business we may make “forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings 

cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results forwardlooking statements generally include statements containing 

 

  

you should view these statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance circumstances or events they are based on the facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events circumstances or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto outlined below are some of the risks that we face and that could affect our business and financial statement for 2007 and beyond however they are not the only risks that we face there may be other risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also impair our business or financial position 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

 

we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists of large national waste management companies and local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage 

 

in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts when this happens we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or retain our customers resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business 

 

if we do not successfully manage our costs our income from operations could be lower than expected 

 

in recent years we have implemented several profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our revenues and we continue to seek ways to reduce our selling general and administrative and operating expenses while generally we have been successful in managing our selling general and administrative costs subcontractor costs and the effect of fuel price increases our initiatives may not be sufficient even as our revenues increase if we are unable to control variable costs or increases to our fixed costs in the future we will be unable to maintain or expand our margins 

 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement our plans and strategies to improve margins and increase our income from operations 

 

we have announced several programs and strategies that we have implemented or planned to improve our margins and operating results for example except when prohibited by contract we have implemented price increases and environmental fees and we continue our fuel surcharge programs all of which have increased our internal revenue growth the loss of volumes as a result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations additionally we have announced plans to divest underperforming and nonstrategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability we may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and nonstrategic operations which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low 

margin businesses if we are not able to fully implement our plans for any reason many of which are out of our control we may not see the expected improvements in our income from operations or our operating margins 

 

the seasonal nature of our business and changes in general and local economic conditions cause our quarterly results to fluctuate and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the warmer months of the year primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste in those months the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally the storm conditions during hurricane season which is generally june through november can increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs stormrelated revenue often generates comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities in the slower winter months when electrical demand is generally lower 

 

our business is affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are also outside of our control including interest rates and consumer confidence we have 30 billion of debt as of december 31 2006 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the combined impact of our variable rate taxexempt bonds and our interest rate swap agreements therefore any increase in interest rates can significantly increase our expenses additionally although our services are of an essential nature a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues we also face risks related to other adverse external factors such as the ability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect that significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may have on such ability 

 

any of the factors described above could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally due to these and other factors operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period 

 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety laws and cannot guarantee that they will not be material 

 

we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of air drinking water or soil under current law we could even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past and may in the future become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

 

  

we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

 

  

regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

 

in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

 

significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses and price increases may also increase our tax expense 

 

the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have ranged from an increase of 40 to a decrease of 5 we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses additionally as fuel prices increase our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs we may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising costs of fuel although there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that such programs will be successful regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs the increased operating costs will decrease our operating margins 

 

additionally our effective tax rate through 2007 is expected to be significantly lower than statutory tax rates due in part to section 45k formerly section 29 tax credits we realize from our landfill gas sales and investments in coalbased synthetic fuel partnerships the ability to earn section 45k tax credits is tied to an average benchmark oil price determined by the internal revenue service and the credits are phased out as the benchmark average price increases higher crude oil prices will phase out our credits and increase our effective tax rate which will result in higher tax expense 

 

we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities 

 

the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and 

therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels we face the risk of incurring liabilities for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby allowing us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

 

in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to environmental closure and postclosure liabilities we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance or fund trust and escrow accounts we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations we do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future however in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance these types of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain which could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

 

the possibility of development and expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge against our earnings 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired a pending acquisition is not completed a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility acquisition or project we reduce the charge against earnings by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise 

 

in future periods we may be required to incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or due to other events that cause impairments any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices 

 

our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard “occ” and old newsprint “onp” we enter into commodity price derivatives in an effort to mitigate some of the variability in cash flows from the sales of recyclable materials at floating market prices in the past three years the yearoveryear changes in the quarterly average market prices for occ ranged from a decrease of as much as 33 to an increase of as much as 36 the same comparisons for onp have ranged from a decrease of as much as 15 to an increase of as much as 29 these fluctuations can affect future operating income and cash flows additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers based on the market prices of commodities we buy to process for resale therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase 

 

additionally there may be significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energy related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations the marketing and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and wastetoenergy operations are generally pursuant to longterm sales agreements therefore market fluctuations do not have a significant effect on these operations in the shortterm however as those agreements expire and are up for renewal changes in market prices may affect our revenues additionally revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly electricity prices have increased as much as 12 

 

the development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal and wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity 

 

our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill and wastetoenergy disposal such as recycling and composting in addition some state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard wastes at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities although such mandates are a useful tool to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services 

 

efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could increase our operating expenses 

 

labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements work stoppages including strikes could ensue depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions our operating expenses could increase significantly which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

 

we may experience problems with either the operation of our current information technology systems or the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved we have purchased and developed a new revenue management system and are piloting the system in the first half of 2007 with additional implementation to occur in late 2007 and early 2008 we may encounter problems in the development or deployment of this system that could result in significant errors in or disruption of our billing processes additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable law and regulations 

 

we may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 

 

our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our reported operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods 

 

unforeseen circumstances could result in a need for additional capital 

 

we currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures acquisitions and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary additional financings however materially adverse events could reduce our cash flows from operations our board of directors has approved a capital allocation program that provides for up to 12 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases during 2007 and recently announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments when declared by the board of directors to be 024 per share if our cash flows from operations were negatively affected we could be forced to 

reduce capital expenditures acquisition activity share repurchase activity or dividend declarations in these circumstances we instead may elect to incur more indebtedness if we made such an election there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable terms in these circumstances we would likely use our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs 

 

in the event of a default under our credit facility we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do additionally any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december 31 2006 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

significant financial achievements during the year ended december 31 2006 include 

 

  

free cash flow  — free cash flow is a nongaap measure of financial performance that we include in our disclosures because we believe the production of free cash flow is an important measure of our liquidity and performance and because we believe our investors are interested in the cash we produce from nonfinancing activities that is available for acquisitions share repurchases scheduled debt repayments and the payment of 

dividends the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow is “net cash provided by operating activities” we calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below in millions 

 

 

 

the growth in our 2006 operating and free cash flow reflects the current year improvements in our operating results particularly those contributed by our increase in revenue from yield which is discussed below 

 

revenue growth  — our revenues for the year increased over 2 from 13074 million in 2005 to 13363 million in 2006 the overall increase was largely a result of internal revenue growth or irg irg is an important indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase revenues from our existing operations our irg for the year was 27 and consisted primarily of improvement in yield on base business and an increase in revenues related to our fuel surcharge program our revenue growth from improved yield on base business for 2006 was 36 which is an increase of 09 percentage points from the prior year in addition our fuel surcharge program contributed 117 million to revenue growth in 2006 compared with 157 million in 2005 the revenues generated by the program in 2006 recovered the increase in our operating costs attributable to fuel the increases in revenue from improved yield on base business and our fuel surcharge program were partially offset by decreased revenues due to lower volumes additionally the positive effect irg had on overall revenue growth was offset by divestitures during the year we have divested of underperforming operations which resulted in lower revenues in the year although we continue to seek appropriate acquisitions in 2006 we lost more revenue as a result of divestitures than we gained from acquisitions as discussed below we believe that the negative impact divestitures had on revenues resulted in improvements in our operating margins 

 

margin improvement  — in 2006 our income from operations improved by 319 million or 187 as compared with 2005 income from operations as a percentage of revenues was 152 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with 131 for the year ended december 31 2005 several items that negatively affected our 2005 results and are not part of our ongoing operations significantly impact the comparability of our 2006 and 2005 operating results when focusing on our core operating costs which are operating selling general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues our margin improvement was considerable increasing 16 percentage points from 138 in 2005 to 154 in 2006 the yearoveryear decrease in our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is largely a result of our increased revenue provided by base business yield but is also due to the success of our cost control initiatives which have focused on improving productivity and standardizing our practices and the divestitures of underperforming operations our selling general and administrative expenses in 2006 increased by 112 million and as a percentage of revenue increased by 06 percentage points to 104 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses is due largely to higher bonus expense as a result of the significant improvement in the company’s performance noncapitalizable costs incurred to support the development of our revenue management system and a 20 million charge to record estimated unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property audits 

 

2007 objectives  — in 2007 we will continue to pursue our goal of improving our profitability by focusing on revenue growth through pricing eliminating our less profitable work lowering our operating expenses managing our selling general and administrative expenses and generating strong and consistent cash flows that can be returned to our shareholders 

 

late in 2006 we began to see a decline in our revenue growth due to decreases in volumes we believe that this decline can be attributed to our pricing strategy and an economic softening in certain lines of our business in certain parts of the country even when considering these volume declines which may continue in 2007 we have seen that our focus on increasing revenue through yield and shedding our less profitable volumes has been positive for our 

operating margins and our cash flows as we consider the continuing effects of this approach on our business we will continue to focus on our stated longterm strategy of seeking operational excellence and improving profitability divesting underperforming and nonstrategic operations and seeking acquisition and investment candidates such as landfill gastoenergy projects that we believe will offer superior margins and returns on capital 

 

basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information 

 

accounting change  — on january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” which requires compensation expense to be recognized for all sharebased payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant we adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which results in i the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of sfas no 123r for all sharebased awards granted or modified after december 31 2005 and ii the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas no 123” for all unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption 

 

through december 31 2005 as permitted by sfas no 123 we accounted for equitybased compensation in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended “apb no 25” under apb no 25 we recognized compensation expense based on an award’s intrinsic value for stock options which were the primary form of awards we granted through december 31 2004 this meant that we recognized no compensation expense in connection with the grants as the exercise price of the options was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and all other provisions were fixed as discussed below beginning in 2005 restricted stock units and performance share units became the primary form of equitybased compensation awarded under our longterm incentive plans for restricted stock units intrinsic value is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant for performance share units apb no 25 required “variable accounting” which resulted in the recognition of compensation expense based on the intrinsic value of each award at the end of each reporting period until such time that the number of shares to be issued and all other provisions are fixed 

 

in december 2005 the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive plans effective december 28 2005 the decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the noncash compensation expense that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a result of adopting sfas no 123r we estimated that the acceleration eliminated approximately 55 million of cumulative pretax compensation charges that would have been recognized during 2006 2007 and 2008 as the stock options would have continued to vest we recognized a 2 million pretax charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the acceleration but do not expect to recognize future compensation expense for the accelerated options under sfas no 123r 

 

additionally as a result of changes in accounting required by sfas no 123r and a desire to design our longterm incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to operating and market performance the management development and compensation committee approved a substantial change in the form of awards that we grant beginning in 2005 annual stock option grants were replaced with either i grants of restricted stock units and performance share units or ii an enhanced cash compensation award stock option grants in connection with new hires and promotions were replaced with grants of restricted stock units the terms of restricted stock units and performance share units granted during 2006 are summarized in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of stock options and the replacement of future awards of stock options with other forms of equity awards the adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 did not significantly affect our accounting for equitybased compensation or net income for the year ended december 31 2006 we do not currently expect this change in accounting to significantly impact our future results of operations however we do expect equitybased compensation expense to increase over the next three years because of the incremental expense that will be recognized each year as additional awards are granted 

 

reconsideration of a variable interest  — during 2006 the debt of a previously consolidated variable interest entity was refinanced as a result of the refinancing our guarantee arrangement was also renegotiated significantly reducing the value of our guarantee we determined that the refinancing of the entity’s debt obligations and 

corresponding renegotiation of our guarantee represented significant changes in the entity that required reconsideration of the applicability of fin 46r as a result of the reconsideration of our interest in this variable interest entity we concluded that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of this entity accordingly in april 2006 we deconsolidated the entity the deconsolidation of this entity did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 

 

certain reclassifications have also been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year information with the current period presentation the supplementary financial information included in this section has been updated to reflect these changes 

 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

 

in preparing our financial statements we make several estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of our assets liabilities stockholders’ equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in preparing our financial statements the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments and selfinsurance reserves and recoveries as described below actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

landfills  — the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 143 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations 

 

landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

 

final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often if significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain changes in estimates for closure and postclosure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization 

 

remaining permitted airspace — our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

 

expansion airspace — we include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely considering the following criteria 

 

  

for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the unpermitted airspace is included our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill in these circumstances continued inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 62 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2006 14 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace eight of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because of a lack of community or political support that could impede the expansion process the remaining six landfills required approval mainly due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes would not meet the one or five year requirements generally due to statespecific permitting procedures 

 

once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined an airspace utilization factor auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several sitespecific factors including current and projected mix of waste type initial and projected waste density estimated number of years of life remaining depth of underlying waste and anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate in addition the 

initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multilevel review by our engineering group our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 

 

when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

 

after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill amortization we look at factors such as the waste stream geography and rate of compaction among others to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change 

 

it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher final capping closure or postclosure rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

 

environmental remediation liabilities  — we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site these liabilities include potentially responsible party “prp” investigations settlements certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates and assumptions 

 

we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site next we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

 

  

asset impairments  — our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization however accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired if significant events or 

changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group or an actual thirdparty valuation if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 

 

typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include 

 

  

if any of these or other indicators occur the asset is reviewed to determine whether there has been an impairment estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below 

 

landfills — certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry 

 

goodwill — at least annually we assess whether goodwill is impaired we assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the book value of goodwill to its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of each of our reporting unit’s group’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances such as those listed above that would indicate that more likely than not the book value of goodwill has been impaired 

 

selfinsurance reserves and recoveries  — we have retained a portion of the risks related to our health and welfare automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table presents for the periods indicated the periodtoperiod change in dollars in millions and percentages for the respective consolidated statement of operations line items 

 

 

 

 

 30 

the following table presents for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that the respective consolidated statement of operations line items has to operating revenues 

 

 

 

operating revenues 

 

our operating revenues in 2006 were 134 billion compared with 131 billion in 2005 and 125 billion in 2004 we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western wheelabrator which includes our wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants or ipps and recycling groups these six operating groups are our reportable segments shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our six operating groups and our other waste services 

 

 

 

our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer wheelabrator and recycling services some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance a 

liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the weight volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semimonthly fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site and are normally billed monthly our wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam recycling revenue which is generated by our recycling group as well as our four geographic operating groups generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements the mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions 

 

 

 

the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

 

 

 

base business  — revenue growth from yield on base business reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection transfer disposal and wastetoenergy operations exclusive of volume changes our revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price increases but also i price decreases to retain customers ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided our pricing excellence initiative continues to be the primary contributor to internal revenue growth 

 

in both 2005 and 2006 revenue growth from base business yield was primarily attributable to our collection operations where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating group our base 

business yield improvement resulted largely from our focus on pricing our business based on marketspecific factors including our costs as discussed below the significant collection revenue increases due to yield have been partially offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes in assessing the impact of higher collection yield on our volumes we continue to find that in spite of collection volume declines revenue growth from base business yield and a focus on controlling variable costs are providing notable earnings margin and cash flow improvements 

 

throughout 2006 increases in revenue due to yield on base business at our transfer stations and for our construction and demolition and municipal solid waste streams at our landfills were also noteworthy these improvements were due to the practices implemented as a result of our findings from our pricing studies the increases in transfer station revenues in 2006 were the most significant in the eastern and western portions of the united states at our landfills construction and demolition revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the west and south and municipal solid waste revenue growth from yield was provided by the east south and midwest in 2005 our transfer business in the east and municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the south provided the most significant revenue growth from base business yield in those lines of our business 

 

we also experienced substantial yield contributions to revenues from our wastetoenergy facilities in the second half of 2005 and through the third quarter of 2006 the revenue improvements at our wastetoenergy facilities were largely due to significant increases in the rates charged for electricity under our longterm contracts with electric utilities which generally are indexed to natural gas prices 

 

our environmental cost recovery fee which is included in base business yield increased revenues on a yearoveryear basis by 43 million in 2006 and 33 million in 2005 other fee programs which were targeted at recovering the costs we incur for services that are included in base business yield such as fees for the collection of past due balances also contributed to yield improvement in 2006 

 

the 2005 revenue improvements attributable to yield discussed above were partially offset by a general decline in yield in special waste landfill disposal operations noted principally in our midwest and southern groups 

 

commodity  — our revenues in both 2005 and 2006 declined as compared with the prior year due to price decreases in recycling commodities average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by 8 in both 2005 and 2006 from 85 per ton in 2004 to 78 per ton in 2005 and to 72 per ton in 2006 average prices for old newsprint were also down by about 3 in 2005 and 7 in 2006 from 86 per ton in 2004 to 83 per ton in 2005 and to 77 per ton in 2006 

 

a significant portion of revenues attributable to commodities is rebated to our suppliers of recyclable materials accordingly changes in our revenues due to fluctuations in commodity prices have a corresponding impact on our cost of goods sold 

 

fuel surcharges and fees  — fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by 117 million for 2006 and 157 million for 2005 these increases are due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges the substantial increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be attributed to i increases in market prices for fuel ii an increase in the number of customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program and iii the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors 

 

increases in our operating expenses due to higher diesel fuel prices include our direct fuel costs for our operations which are included in operating expenses — fuel  as well as estimated indirect fuel costs which are included primarily in operating expenses — subcontractor costs as discussed in the operating expenses section below during 2006 our fuel surcharge program recovered both components of our higher costs our fuel surcharge program substantially recovered these costs for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the passthrough of fees and taxes assessed by various state county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations these mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above 

 

volume  — declines in revenue due to lower volumes between 2006 and 2005 were driven by decreases in our collection volumes due primarily to our focus on improving the margins in this line of business through pricing 

these revenue declines were the most significant in our residential and industrial collection operations with our eastern southern and midwestern groups experiencing the most notable decreases our commercial collection operations also had declines in revenue due to lower volumes in 2006 principally in the midwestern and eastern groups the decline in revenue due to lower volumes for our collection operations was also due to a decrease in hurricane related revenues in the south 

 

the revenue declines in our collection businesses in 2006 were partially offset by increased disposal volumes in all of our geographic regions through the first nine months of the year our special waste municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste streams were the primary drivers of this growth in revenues due to higher volumes we believe that the strength of the economy throughout most of the year and favorable weather in many parts of the country were the primary drivers of the higher disposal volumes in the fourth quarter of 2006 we experienced a decline in disposal volumes as compared with the fourth quarter of 2005 which we believe is due to the lack of hurricane volumes in 2006 competition impacts of our pricing initiatives and an economic softening in certain lines of our business in certain parts of the country 

 

also contributing to the decline in our revenues due to lower volumes for 2006 were i the completion of the construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a municipality in canada in early 2006 ii the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity during the second quarter of 2006 and iii decreased volumes from our transfer station and recycling operations 

 

revenues due to changes in volumes were relatively flat when comparing 2005 with 2004 this was generally because of the combined impacts of i a decline in revenues associated with hurricanes ii increases in recycling and landfill disposal volumes and iii lower revenue from residential commercial and industrial collection volumes particularly in the east and midwest which can generally be attributed to our focus on improving our margins by increasing yield 

 

our revenue due to volumes generated from hurricane related services were 56 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared with 115 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 59 million decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain of our operations in the gulf coast region during 2005 as a result of the severe destruction caused by hurricane katrina in addition much of our 2004 hurricane related revenues was associated with subcontracted services which generated comparatively lower margins in 2005 we generally elected not to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not support the required services with internal resources 

 

when excluding the impacts of the hurricanes revenue due to higher volumes increased 62 million or 05 during 2005 this increase was largely due to i increased recycling volumes provided by several brokerage contracts ii increased landfill disposal volumes in the midwest west and south iii increased transfer station volumes in the west and the south and iv increased residential collection volumes in the west also included as a component of revenue growth from volumes in 2005 was revenue generated from our construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a municipality in canada the revenue generated by this project was low margin and largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold  

 

these revenue increases were largely offset by volume declines experienced in each line of business in the eastern portion of the united states and significant volume declines in our collection business in the midwest 

 

acquisitions and divestitures  — the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on our revenues was a decrease of 102 million in 2006 and an increase of 50 million in 2005 the significant change in these impacts is a result of our divestiture plan which was initiated in the third quarter of 2005 

 

operating expenses 

 

our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below which include salaries and wages bonuses related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to thirdparty disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and are driven by transportation costs such as fuel prices 

v costs of goods sold which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include landfill remediation costs leachate and methane collection and treatment other landfill site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement obligations ix risk management costs which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent and property taxes 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

our operating expense margin improved 17 percentage points from 660 in 2005 to 643 in 2006 this improvement can be attributed to the fact that we experienced increased revenues while controlling our total operating costs our ability to manage operating costs demonstrates progress on our operational excellence initiatives such as improving productivity reducing fleet maintenance costs standardizing operating practices and improving safety in addition our operating expenses have declined when comparing 2006 with 2005 due in part to divestitures and reduced volumes divestitures and reduced volumes have contributed to reduced costs or have offset other cost increases in every category throughout 2006 

 

the impact of our cost control initiatives divestitures volumes and other significant factors on the comparability of costs incurred for each operating expense category in 2006 2005 and 2004 are summarized below 

 

labor and related benefits  — when comparing 2006 with 2005 these costs have increased due to annual merit increases and higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance on a yearoveryear basis these cost increases were partially offset by i declines in health and welfare insurance expenses due to our focus on controlling costs and reductions in operations personnel as a result of divestitures ii reduced overtime generally associated with our reduced volumes and iii reduced headcount due to divestitures and our focus on operating efficiencies in 2005 the yearoveryear increase in costs was generally due to higher salary and wage costs general increases in health care and benefits costs increased costs attributable to contract labor and increased payroll taxes 

 

transfer and disposal costs  — in 2006 and 2005 the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at thirdparty transfer stations or landfills declined due to our focus on improving internalization during 2006 declines in these costs are also attributable to the impact of divestitures and general volume declines 

 

maintenance and repairs  — in 2006 these costs were relatively flat due to the offsetting impacts of increases in labor costs and decreases driven by i changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our wastetoenergy facilities ii the impact of divestitures and iii various fleet initiatives all of which have favorably affected our maintenance parts and supplies costs the increases in these costs in 2005 were attributable to i higher parts and supplies costs which were driven by changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our wastetoenergy facilities 

and increased volumes in our southern and western groups ii increases in the cost of lubes and oils and iii increases in the labor costs associated with our maintenance and repairs 

 

subcontractor costs  — throughout 2006 and 2005 we experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to thirdparty subcontractors subcontractor cost increases attributable to higher fuel costs were offset by the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program which is reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues additionally in 2006 the increase in our subcontractor costs due to higher fuel costs was partially offset by a decrease attributable to our divestiture of underperforming and nonstrategic operations and decreases in volumes 

 

in 2005 we also incurred additional transportation costs due to increased volumes in subcontracted work particularly in our national accounts organization and our western group this cost increase was partially offset by a yearoveryear decline in the utilization of subcontractors to assist in providing hurricane related services which were particularly significant during 2004 

 

cost of goods sold  — these costs are primarily for rebates paid to our recycling suppliers which are driven by the market prices of recyclable commodities in 2006 we experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities and reduced recycling volumes 

 

additionally in 2006 the decrease in costs of goods sold was partially due to completion of the construction of an integrated waste facility in canada in early 2006 the increase in cost of goods sold in 2005 was partially due to costs incurred to construct this integrated waste facility also in 2005 we experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities than in prior years this decrease in pricing was more than offset by increased recycling volumes in 2005 due to several new brokerage contracts and acquisitions 

 

fuel  — we experienced an estimated average increase of 031 per gallon for 2006 as compared with 2005 and of 059 per gallon for 2005 as compared with 2004 while our fuel surcharge is designed to recover the cost increases incurred as a result of higher fuel prices increased fuel costs continue to negatively affect our operating margin percentages revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues 

 

disposal and franchise fees and taxes  — in 2006 these costs have remained relatively flat primarily as a result of decreases associated with divestitures and general volume declines partially offset by increases in rates for mandated fees and taxes in certain markets in 2005 these cost increases were the result of increased volumes and increased rates for mandated fees and taxes certain of these cost increases are passed through to our customers and have been reflected as fee yield increases within operating revenues 

 

landfill operating costs  — for 2006 and 2005 these cost increases have generally been related to higher site maintenance leachate collection monitoring and testing and closure and postclosure expenses 

 

risk management  — over the last two years we have been increasingly successful in reducing these costs largely due to reduced workers’ compensation costs which can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates 

 

other operating expenses  — the lower costs in 2006 as compared with 2005 can be attributed to i hurricane katrina related support costs in 2005 particularly in louisiana where we built camp waste management to house and feed hundreds of our employees who worked in the new orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts ii higher rental expense in 2005 and iii a decrease related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in early 2006 

 

in addition to the 2005 items noted above the increase in our other operating costs when comparing 2005 with 2004 can be attributed to i a yearoveryear decrease in the realization of gains on sales of assets ii costs incurred during 2005 attributable to labor strikes in new jersey and canada and iii an increase in costs generated by the variable interest entity discussed above 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs which include salaries bonuses related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunications advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

our professional fees and to a lesser extent our labor costs and other general and administrative costs for the year ended december 31 2006 were increased by 20 million for noncapitalizable costs incurred to support the planned implementation of our new revenue management system this increase and other significant changes in our selling general and administrative expenses are summarized below 

 

labor and related benefits  — in both 2006 and 2005 these costs increased yearoveryear due to higher bonus expense attributable to the overall improvement in our performance and higher noncash compensation costs associated with the equitybased compensation provided for by our longterm incentive plan also contributing to the increase in labor costs in 2006 and 2005 are higher salaries and hourly wages driven by annual merit raises and an increase in the size of our sales force these increases were partially offset by savings associated with our 2005 restructuring fluctuations in our use of contract labor for corporate support functions caused an increase in 2006 and a decline in 2005 as compared with the prior year periods 

 

professional fees  — in 2006 our professional fees were higher than in 2005 due to higher consulting fees associated with our pricing initiatives and the development of our revenue management system however the overall increase in consulting fees in 2006 was partially offset by costs incurred during 2005 for computer support costs related to a revenue management project for our recycling group in 2005 we experienced a decline in professional fees as compared with the prior year as a result of lower litigation and defense costs and lower consulting costs associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act as we moved from the implementation phase in 2004 to continued monitoring and testing in 2005 

 

other  — we are currently undergoing unclaimed property audits which are being conducted by various state authorities the property subject to review in this audit process generally includes unclaimed wages vendor payments and customer refunds during 2006 we submitted unclaimed property filings with all states as a result of our findings we determined that we had unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property for escheatable items for various periods between 1980 and 2004 the increase in our expenses includes a 20 million charge to record these estimated unrecorded obligations refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the nature of this charge additionally in both 2006 and 2005 our other costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs associated with our national advertising campaign and higher travel and entertainment costs due partially to the development of our revenue management system and our efforts to implement various initiatives 

 

depreciation and amortization 

 

depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded due to capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs including 

those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 27 million during 2006 when compared with 2005 the decrease was due in part to the suspension of depreciation on assets heldforsale divestitures and the discontinuation of depreciation on enterprisewide software that is now fully depreciated 

 

the comparability of our depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 has also been significantly affected by i a 21 million charge to landfill amortization recognized in 2005 to adjust the amortization periods of nine of our leased landfills and ii adjustments to landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 landfill amortization expense was reduced by 1 million 13 million and 18 million respectively for the effects of these changes in estimate in each year the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes 

 

restructuring 

 

management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure these reviews have highlighted efficiencies and cost savings we could capture by restructuring the most significant cost savings we have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “selling general and administrative” expenses 

 

during the third quarter of 2005 we reorganized and simplified our organizational structure by eliminating certain support functions performed at the group or corporate office we also eliminated the canadian group office which reduced the number of our operating groups from seven to six this reorganization has reduced costs at the group and corporate offices and increased the accountability of our market areas we recorded 28 million of pretax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure principally for employee severance and benefit costs 

 

income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

 

 

 

year ended december 31 2006 

 

asset impairments  — during the second and third quarters of 2006 we recorded impairment charges of 13 million and 5 million respectively for operations we intend to sell as part of our divestiture program the charges were required to reduce the carrying values of the operations to their estimated fair values less the cost to sell in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  for assets to be disposed of by sale 

 

during the third and fourth quarters of 2006 we recorded impairment charges of 10 million and 14 million respectively for assets and businesses associated with our continuing operations the charges recognized during the third quarter of 2006 were related to operations in our recycling and southern groups the charges recognized during the fourth quarter of 2006 were primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our eastern group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions 

 

income expense from divestitures  — we recognized 44 million of net gains on divestitures during the year ended december 31 2006 which were direct results of the execution of our plan to review underperforming or nonstrategic operations and to either improve their performance or dispose of the operations the majority of these net gains was recognized during the second quarter of 2006 and relates to operations located in our western group total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended december 31 2006 were 184 million all of which were received in cash 

 

other  — during the fourth quarter of 2006 we recognized a charge of approximately 26 million for the impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000 the party that purchased our interest in the joint venture had sued us seeking a variety of remedies ranging from monetary damages to unwinding the sale of assets in the fourth quarter of 2006 the arbitration tribunal ruled in the other party’s favor awarding them approximately 29 million which includes monetary damages interest and certain fees and expenses prior to the ruling the company had recorded a reserve of 3 million for additional information regarding this matter refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements 

 

year ended december 31 2005 

 

asset impairments  — during the second quarter of 2005 our eastern group recorded a 35 million charge for the impairment of the pottstown landfill located in west pottsgrove township pennsylvania we determined that an impairment was necessary after the pennsylvania environmental hearing board upheld a denial by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection of a permit application for a vertical expansion at the landfill after the denial was upheld the company reviewed the options available at the pottstown landfill and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options after such evaluation and considering the length of time required for the appeal process and the permit application review we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial this decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the permitting delays which would hinder our ability to fully utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill’s required closure in 2010 we continued to operate the pottstown landfill using existing permitted airspace through the landfill’s permit expiration date of october 2005 

 

through june 30 2005 our “property and equipment” had included approximately 80 million of accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system approximately 59 million of these costs were specifically associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use while the remaining costs were associated with the general efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our existing applications and hardware the development efforts associated with our revenue management system were suspended in 2003 since that time there have been changes in the viable software alternatives available to address our current needs during the third quarter of 2005 we concluded our assessment of potential revenue management system options as a result we entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the license implementation and maintenance of certain of its applications software including waste and recycling functionality we believe that these newly licensed applications when fully implemented will provide substantially better capabilities and functionality than the software we were developing our plan to implement this newly licensed software resulted in a 59 million charge in the third quarter of 2005 for the software that had been under development and capitalized costs associated with the development efforts specific to that software 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 we recognized an 18 million charge for asset impairments this charge was primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our eastern group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the impairment of capitalized software costs related to two applications we decided not to develop further 

 

income expense from divestitures  — during the first quarter of 2005 we recognized a 39 million gain as a result of the divestiture of a landfill in ontario canada which was required as a result of a divestiture order from the canadian competition bureau during the remainder of 2005 we recognized a total of 40 million in gains as a result of the divestiture of operations with the exception of our divestiture of the ontario canada landfill our divestitures during 2005 were direct results of the execution of our plan to review underperforming or nonstrategic operations and to either improve their performance or dispose of the operations 

 

total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended december 31 2005 were 172 million of which 140 million was received in cash 23 million was in the form of a note receivable and 9 million was in the form of nonmonetary assets 

 

other  — in the first quarter of 2005 we recognized a charge of approximately 16 million for the impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of stockholders that opted not to participate in the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998 and 1999 activity during the third quarter of 2005 we settled our ongoing defense costs and possible indemnity obligations for four former officers of wm holdings related to legacy litigation brought against them by the sec as a result we recorded a 268 million charge for the funding of the courtordered distribution of 275 million to our shareholders in settlement of the legacy litigation against the former officers these charges were partially offset by the recognition of a 12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended december 31 2005 which was primarily for adjustments to our receivables and estimated obligations for nonsolid waste operations divested in 1999 and 2000 

 

year ended december 31 2004 

 

for 2004 the significant items included within “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” were i 17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs ii 12 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain portolet ® operations and iii 18 million in miscellaneous net gains which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated obligations associated with nonsolid waste services which were divested in 1999 and 2000 

 

income from operations by reportable segment 

 

the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

overview  — revenue growth from base business yield improvement which is primarily the result of our continued focus on pricing significantly contributed to the operating income of each of our geographic groups during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 base business yield provided revenue growth for each line of business in 2006 but was driven primarily by our collection operations where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating group for the second consecutive year the operating results of the groups have also benefited from our focus on cost control and from increases in higher margin disposal volumes during 

both 2005 and 2006 these improvements were partially offset by declines in revenues due to lower volumes in the collection line of business particularly in our eastern group see the additional discussion in the operating revenues section above 

 

the operating results for the year ended december 31 2006 also compare favorably with the prior years due to the 27 million restructuring charge recognized during the third quarter of 2005 “corporate and other” reflects 10 million of this impact with the remaining 17 million allocated across the operating groups see additional discussion of these charges in the restructuring section above 

 

other significant items affecting the comparability of the operating segments’ results of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 are summarized below 

 

eastern  — the group’s operating income for the year ended december 31 2006 was negatively affected by 26 million in charges associated with i the impairment of businesses being sold as part of our divestiture program and ii the impairment of a landfill the year ended december 31 2005 was negatively affected by the recognition of 44 million in impairment charges related primarily to the pottstown landfill finally the operating results of our eastern group for 2006 and 2005 were negatively affected by costs incurred in connection with labor strikes for the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 14 million of costs related primarily to a strike in the new york city area the group incurred similar costs during the first quarter of 2005 for a labor strike in new jersey which decreased operating income for the year ended december 31 2005 by approximately 9 million 

 

midwest  — positively affecting 2005 results compared with the prior year was a decline in landfill amortization expense generally as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations 

 

southern  — during 2005 several large nonrecurring type items were recognized impacting comparisons to the other periods presented these items include 13 million of pretax gains recognized on the divestiture of operations during 2005 and declines in earnings related to i hurricanes largely due to the temporary suspension of operations in the areas affected by hurricane katrina ii the effects of higher landfill amortization costs generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations and iii higher landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations 

 

western  — gains on divestitures of operations were 48 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared with 24 million for 2005 and 10 million for 2004 

 

wheelabrator  — the electric rates we charge to our customers at our wastetoenergy facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of 2005 as a result of higher market prices for natural gas the rates we charge customers are indexed to natural gas prices which increased significantly as a result of hurricanerelated production disruptions increased demand and increases in crude oil prices this increase in rates was the principal reason for the 2005 increase in wheelabrator’s income from operations as compared with 2004 the favorable impact of market prices for natural gas was partially offset by higher costs of goods sold and higher repair and maintenance costs due to the scope and timing of maintenance performed in 2005 as compared with 2004 

 

recycling  — during 2006 the group recognized 10 million of charges for a loss on divestiture and an impairment of certain underperforming operations which were slightly more than offset by savings associated with the group’s cost control efforts the decrease in income from operations in our recycling group during 2005 when compared with 2004 can generally be attributed to i an increase in the rebates paid to our suppliers as a result of increased competition ii costs related to the deployment of new software and iii higher subcontractor costs primarily related to increased distances traveled by thirdparty haulers 

 

the comparability of operating results for the recycling group for all of the periods presented has been affected by variances in the market prices for recyclable commodities during the three years ended december 31 2006 yearoveryear changes in the quarterly average market prices of occ and onp have 

ranged from a decrease of as much as 33 to an increase of as much as 36 however declines in the market prices for recyclable commodities resulted in only marginal yearoveryear decreases to our income from operations during 2006 and 2005 because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers 

 

other  — the changes in “income from operations” attributed to our other operations is driven primarily by the 2005 recognition of a 39 million pretax gain resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in ontario canada this impact is included in “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” within our consolidated statement of operations as this landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005 reorganization historical financial information associated with its operations has not been allocated to our remaining reportable segments accordingly these impacts have been included in other the impact of this 2005 divestiture gain is partially offset by the effect of certain other quarterend adjustments related to the operating segments that are recorded in consolidation and due to timing not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed 

 

corporate  — expenses were higher in 2005 as compared with 2006 primarily due to impairment charges in 2005 of 68 million associated with capitalized software costs and 31 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters in 2006 we recognized 37 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters these items are discussed in the income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items section above 

 

in 2006 we experienced lower risk management and employee health and welfare plan costs largely due to our focus on safety and controlling costs these cost savings have been largely offset by the following cost increases i a 20 million charge recorded to recognize unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property which is discussed in the selling general and administrative section above ii increased incentive compensation expense associated with the company’s current strong performance iii higher consulting fees and sales commissions primarily related to our pricing initiatives iv an increase in our marketing costs due to our national advertising campaign and v the centralization of support functions that were provided by our group offices prior to our 2005 reorganization 

 

the higher expenses in 2005 as compared with 2004 were driven by the previously noted 99 million charged to “income expense from divestitures asset impairments and unusual items” during 2005 also contributing to the increase in expenses during 2005 were i noncash employee compensation costs associated with current year changes in equitybased compensation ii inflation in employee health care costs iii salary and wage annual merit increases iv costs for sales and marketing programs and v costs at corporate associated with our july 2005 restructuring charge and organizational changes which were partially offset by associated savings at corporate 

 

other components of income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

 

the following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions 

 

 

 

 

 42 

 

interest expense 

 

the increase in interest expense in 2006 and 2005 is generally related to higher market interest rates which have resulted in a decrease in the benefit of our interest rate swaps and an increase in the interest rates of our variable rate debt the increase in our interest expense in 2006 due to higher market interest rates was partially offset by the impact of a decrease in our outstanding debt which is due to our repayment of borrowings throughout the year 

 

we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates the combined impact of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in a net interest expense increase of 4 million for 2006 and net interest expense reductions of 39 million and 90 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively the significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our active interest rate swap agreements is attributable to the increase in shortterm market interest rates our periodic interest obligations under our active interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from the threemonth libor which has increased from 256 at december 31 2004 to 454 at december 31 2005 and to 536 at december 31 2006 included in the 4 million net increase in interest expense realized in 2006 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is a 41 million reduction in interest expense related to the amortization of terminated swaps our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by 37 million in 2007 33 million in 2008 and 19 million in 2009 

 

in addition we have 652 million of taxexempt borrowings remarketed either daily or weekly to effectively maintain a variable yield the interest rates of these borrowings increased over the last two years due to higher market rates 

 

interest income 

 

the increase in interest income when comparing 2006 with 2005 is due to an increase in our investments in variable rate demand notes and auction rate securities throughout the year interest income for 2006 and 2004 includes interest income of 14 million and 46 million respectively realized on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits 

 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 

 

in the first and second quarters of 2004 we acquired an equity interest in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the activities of these facilities drive our “equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” the significant decrease in the equity losses attributable to these facilities when comparing 2006 with prior years is due to i the estimated effect of a 36 phaseout of section 45k formerly section 29 credits generated during 2006 on our contractual obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses as a result of a substantial increase in market prices of crude oil ii the suspension of operations at the facilities from may to september of 2006 and iii a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately reflect our lifetodate obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and the value of our investment the increase in these losses from 2004 to 2005 is due to the timing of our initial investments in 2004 

 

these equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments the impact of these facilities on our provision for taxes is discussed below within provision for benefit from income taxes additional information related to these investments is included in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

minority interest 

 

on december 31 2003 we consolidated two special purpose type variable interest entities as a result of our implementation of fin 46r our minority interest expense for 2006 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to the other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities additional information related to these investments is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

other net 

 

our other income and expense is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation on our canadian operations 

 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 325 million in 2006 a benefit from income taxes of 90 million in 2005 and a provision for income taxes of 247 million in 2004 resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 221 82 and 210 for each of the three years respectively when excluding the effect of interest income related to audit settlements the settlement of various federal and state tax audit matters during 2006 2005 and 2004 resulted in a reduction in our provision for income taxes of 149 million representing a 101 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate 398 million representing a 364 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate and 101 million representing an 85 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate respectively 

 

the benefit of nonconventional fuel tax credits is derived from methane gas projects at our landfills and our investments in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities which are discussed in the equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities section above these tax credits are available through 2007 pursuant to section 45k of the internal revenue code and are phasedout if the price of crude oil exceeds a threshold annual average price determined by the irs our effective tax rate for 2006 reflects a phaseout of 36 of section 45k tax credits generated during 2006 and a temporary shut down of the synthetic fuel production facilities we have developed our estimate of the phaseout using market information for crude oil prices as of december 31 2006 our synthetic fuel production facility investments resulted in a decrease in our tax provision of 64 million for 2006 145 million for 2005 and 131 million for 2004 which more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities refer to note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impact of these investments on our provision for taxes 

 

for all periods a portion of the difference in income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes is due to state and local income taxes 

 

additionally in 2006 we recorded reductions to income tax expense related to i a decrease in our effective state tax rate resulting in a 9 million benefit related to the revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities ii a 20 million tax benefit due to scheduled tax rate reductions in canada and the resulting revaluation of related net accumulated deferred tax liabilities and iii an 11 million state tax benefit arising from the reduction in the valuation allowance related to the expected utilization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards 

 

in 2005 we recorded additional income tax expense related to i the accrual of 4 million to increase net accumulated deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in the provincial tax rate in quebec and ii the accrual of 34 million of taxes associated with our plan to repatriate 496 million of accumulated earnings and capital from certain of our canadian subsidiaries under the american jobs creation act of 2004 these amounts were offset in part by a change in our estimated state effective tax rate causing us to realize a benefit of 16 million related to the revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities 

 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

 

on march 31 2004 we recorded a credit of 8 million net of taxes or 001 per diluted share to “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by fin 46r see notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

general 

 

we have consistently generated cash flows from operations in excess of our reinvestment needs however we operate in a capitalintensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength in the past we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future these factors include 

 

 44 

 

  

we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet iii refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills and vi repaying debt and discharging other obligations we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business 

 

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” became law a provision of the act allowed us companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005 our chief executive officer and board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated 496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005 the repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings for a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

summary of cash shortterm investments restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations 

 

the following is a summary of our cash shortterm investments available for use restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less 

 

shortterm investments available for use  — these investments include auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes which are debt instruments with longterm scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates the interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic marketing of the underlying securities through an auction process due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the shortterm nature of our investment in these securities they have been classified as current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations funds deposited in connection with landfill closure postclosure and remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits these balances are primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

 

debt 

 

revolving credit and letter of credit facilities  — the table below summarizes the credit capacity maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility principal letter of credit facilities and other credit arrangements as of december 31 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

we have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs certain taxexempt bond issuances municipal and governmental waste management contracts closure and postclosure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits these facilities require us to pay fees to the financial institutions and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit we expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs 

 

canadian credit facility  — in november 2005 waste management of canada corporation one of our whollyowned subsidiaries entered into a threeyear credit facility agreement under which we could borrow up to canadian 410 million the agreement was entered into to facilitate wmi’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its canadian subsidiaries as discussed above 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had 313 million of principal 308 million net of discount outstanding under this credit facility advances under the facility do not accrue interest during their terms accordingly the proceeds we initially received were for the principal amount of the advances net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the advance and the debt was initially recorded based on the net proceeds received the advances have a weighted average effective interest rate of 48 at december 31 2006 which is being amortized to interest expense with a corresponding increase in our recorded debt obligation using the effective interest method during the year ended december 31 2006 we increased the carrying value of the debt for the recognition of 15 million of interest expense a total of 47 million of advances under the facility matured during 2006 and were repaid with available cash accounting for changes in the canadian currency translation rate did not significantly affect the carrying value of these borrowings during 2006 

 

our outstanding advances mature less than one year from the date of issuance but may be renewed under the terms of the facility while we may elect to renew portions of our outstanding advances under the terms of the facility we currently expect to repay our borrowings under the facility within one year with available cash accordingly these borrowings are classified as current in our december 31 2006 consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 we had expected to repay 86 million of outstanding advances with available cash and renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility based on our expectations at that time we classified 86 million as current and 254 million as longterm in our december 31 2005 consolidated balance sheet 

 

senior notes  — as of december 31 2006 we had 48 billion of outstanding senior notes the notes have various maturities ranging from october 2007 to may 2032 and interest rates ranging from 500 to 875 on october 15 2006 300 million of 70 senior notes matured and were repaid with cash on hand we have 300 million of 7125 senior notes that mature in october 2007 that we currently expect to repay with available cash accordingly this borrowing is classified as current as of december 31 2006 

 

taxexempt bonds  — we actively issue taxexempt bonds as a means of accessing lowcost financing for capital expenditures as of december 31 2006 we had 24 billion of outstanding taxexempt bonds we issued 159 million of taxexempt bonds during 2006 the proceeds from these debt issuances were deposited directly into a trust fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services accordingly the restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not been included in “new borrowings” in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2006 as we spend monies on the specific projects being financed we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds as discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above we have 94 million held in trust for future spending as of december 31 2006 during 2006 we received 258 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures 

 

as of december 31 2006 606 million of our taxexempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us these bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our 24 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us accordingly these obligations have been classified as longterm in our december 31 2006 consolidated balance sheet 

 

additionally as of december 31 2006 we have 255 million of fixed rate taxexempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months which is prior to their scheduled maturities if the reofferings of the bonds are unsuccessful then the bonds can be put to us requiring immediate repayment these bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our longterm facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed reoffering and are therefore considered a current obligation for financial reporting purposes however these bonds have been classified as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2006 the classification of these obligations as longterm was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other longterm financings in the event of a failed reoffering and our ability in the event other sources of longterm financing are not available to use our fiveyear revolving credit facility 

 

taxexempt project bonds  — as of december 31 2006 we had 352 million of outstanding taxexempt project bonds these debt instruments are primarily used by our wheelabrator group to finance the development of wastetoenergy facilities the bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments as of 

december 31 2006 46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our fiveyear revolving credit facility accordingly these obligations have been classified as longterm in our december 31 2006 consolidated balance sheet approximately 61 million of our taxexempt project bonds will be repaid with either available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve months 

 

interest rate swaps  — we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2006 the interest payments on 24 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates allowing us to maintain approximately 64 of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 36 of our debt at variable interest rates fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by 19 million as of december 31 2006 and 47 million at december 31 2005 

 

summary of cash flow activity 

 

the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities  — during 2006 and 2005 our cash flows from operating activities increased 149 million and 173 million respectively on a yearoveryear basis in both years the increases were due to growth in our operating income and comparative changes in our receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities and were partially offset by increases in cash paid for income taxes 

 

the change in our receivables balances net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures provided a source of cash of 12 million in 2006 compared to a use of cash in both 2005 and 2004 of 102 million and 223 million respectively in 2006 our receivables balances declined in part due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues as compared with the prior year but also due to improved efficiency of collections we have created and implemented new processes to assist our market areas with collections the increases in our receivables balances and resulting uses of cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows in 2005 and 2004 were primarily related to increased revenues however the significant yearoveryear change can partially be attributed to 2004 receivable balances associated with significant revenues generated from hurricane related services provided in the second half of 2004 

 

we made income tax payments of 475 million in 2006 233 million in 2005 and 136 million in 2004 the increase in 2006 is primarily the result of improved earnings a 36 phaseout of section 45k tax credits and the temporary shutdown of our two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities there was no phaseout of section 45k tax credits or temporary shutdown of the coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities in either 2005 or 2004 the increase from 2004 to 2005 is the combined result of increased earnings and the expiration of firstyear bonus depreciation on property acquired after september 1 2001 and before january 1 2005 which favorably impacted taxes paid in 2004 

 

our provision for income taxes has been significantly affected by tax audit settlements in each period presented tax audit settlements and related interest positively affected our net income by 158 million in 2006 398 million in 2005 and 129 million in 2004 additionally we received cash refunds of 62 million in 2006 and 71 million in 2005 related to these tax audit settlements the remaining impact of these settlements has been reflected as changes in our “accounts payable and accrued liabilities” for the related periods 

 

the comparability of our operating cash flows for the periods presented is also affected by our adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 sfas no 123r requires reductions in income taxes payable attributable to excess tax benefits associated with equitybased compensation to be included in cash flows from financing 

activities which are discussed below prior to adopting sfas no 123r our excess tax benefits associated with equitybased compensation were included within cash flows from operating activities as a change in “accounts payable and accrued liabilities” during 2005 and 2004 these excess tax benefits improved our operating cash flows by approximately 17 million and 37 million respectively 

 

net cash used in investing activities  — we used 788 million of our cash resources for investing activities during 2006 a decrease of 274 million compared with 2005 this decrease is primarily due to i a 417 million increase in net cash flows provided by purchases and sales of shortterm investments ii a 110 million decline in spending for acquisitions of businesses and iii a 46 million increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets the effect of these items on our cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a 149 million increase in capital spending and a 142 million decline in net receipts from restricted trust and escrow accounts 

 

net sales of shortterm investments provided 122 million of cash in 2006 compared with net purchases of shortterm investments of 295 million during 2005 in 2006 we experienced net sales of shortterm investments as we utilized our shortterm investments and available cash to fund our common stock repurchases dividend payments and debt repayments which are discussed below 

 

our spending on acquisitions decreased from 142 million during 2005 to 32 million in 2006 as we make progress on our divestiture program we plan to increase our focus on accretive acquisitions and other investments that will contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance and expand our existing service offerings 

 

proceeds from divestitures net of cash divested and other sales of assets were 240 million in 2006 compared with 194 million in 2005 an increase of 46 million approximately 89 million of our 2005 proceeds were related to the sale of one of our landfills in ontario canada as required by a divestiture order from the canadian competition tribunal when excluding the cash proceeds generated by this transaction proceeds from divestitures have increased by 135 million during 2006 when compared with 2005 this increase is primarily a result of the execution of our plan to divest of certain underperforming and nonstrategic operations 

 

net funds received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts which are largely generated from the issuance of taxexempt bonds for our capital needs contributed 253 million to our investing activities in 2006 compared with 395 million in 2005 the decrease is due to a decline in new taxexempt borrowings 

 

we used 1329 million during 2006 for capital expenditures compared with 1180 million in 2005 the increase occurred across all asset categories however our landfill and vehicles asset categories were the most significantly affected 

 

we used 1062 million of our cash resources for investing activities during 2005 an increase of 180 million compared with 2004 this increase is primarily due to a 266 million change in net cash flows associated with purchases and sales of shortterm investments net purchases of shortterm investments during 2005 were 295 million compared with net purchases of 29 million during 2004 the increase in our shortterm investments available for use as of december 31 2005 can generally be attributed to an increase in our available cash which we used to fund among other things a 275 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that became effective in january 2006 and our first quarter 2006 dividend that was paid in march 2006 our share repurchases and dividends are discussed in our net cash used in financing activities section below 

 

the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities as a result of our shortterm investments was partially offset by i an increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets and ii a decrease in capital expenditures proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other sales of assets were 194 million in 2005 and 96 million in 2004 the 98 million increase from 2004 to 2005 is largely attributable to the sale of one of our landfills in ontario canada capital expenditures were 1180 million in 2005 which is 78 million less than we invested in capital in 2004 

 

net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant changes in our financing cash flows during the three years ended december 31 2006 are related to i increases in cash paid for our repurchases of common stock and cash dividends ii variances in our net debt repayments which can generally be attributed to scheduled 

maturities and iii variances in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants these financing activities are discussed below 

 

our 2006 and 2005 share repurchases and dividend payments have been made in accordance with a threeyear capital allocation program that was approved by our board of directors this capital allocation program authorizes up to 12 billion of combined share repurchases and dividend payments each year during 2005 2006 and 2007 in june 2006 the board of directors authorized up to 350 million of additional share repurchases in 2006 increasing the total of capital authorized for share repurchases and dividends in 2006 to 155 billion 

 

we paid 1072 million for share repurchases in 2006 as compared with 706 million in 2005 and 496 million in 2004 we repurchased approximately 31 million 25 million and 17 million shares of our common stock in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above 

 

we paid an aggregate of 476 million in cash dividends during 2006 compared with 449 million in 2005 and 432 million in 2004 the increase in dividend payments is due to annual increases in our per share dividend payment which increased from a quarterly per share dividend of 01875 in 2004 to 020 in 2005 and to 022 in 2006 the impact of the yearoveryear increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase program in december 2006 the board of directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be 024 per share all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant 

 

net debt repayments were 500 million in 2006 11 million in 2005 and 386 million in 2004 the following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year in millions 

 

 

 

the exercise of common stock options and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of 340 million of financing cash inflows during 2006 compared with 129 million in 2005 and 193 million in 2004 we believe the significant increase in stock option and warrant exercises in 2006 is due to the substantial increase in the market value of our common stock during 2006 the accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock options in december 2005 also resulted in increased cash proceeds from stock option exercises because the acceleration made additional options available for exercise as discussed above the adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 resulted in the classification of tax savings provided by equitybased compensation as a financing cash inflow rather than an operating cash inflow beginning in the first quarter of 2006 this change in accounting increased cash flows from financing activities by 45 million in 2006 

 

summary of contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

 

 

 

 

 51 

 

we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely as a result the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements our thirdparty guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2006 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

 

seasonal trends and inflation 

 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year such as the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005 can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when electrical demand is generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities 

 

while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of fuel have affected our operating margins in recent periods we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

fin 48 — accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” which clarifies the relevant criteria and approach for the recognition derecognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions fin 48 will be effective for the company beginning january 1 2007 we do not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

sfas no 157 — fair value measurements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 will be effective for the company beginning january 1 2008 we are currently in the process of assessing the provisions of sfas no 157 and determining how this framework for measuring fair value will affect our current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements we have not determined whether the adoption of sfas no 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2006 all of our derivative transactions were related to 

actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider creditworthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 

 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 

 

interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are primarily denominated in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations which directly impacts variability in interest costs an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately 460 million at december 31 2006 and 480 million at december 31 2005 this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 

 

we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have 377 million and 460 million of assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included within longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure postclosure and environmental remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

 

currency rate exposure from time to time we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented in addition a change in foreign currency rates would not significantly affect our fair value positions 

 

commodities price exposure we market recycled products such as wastepaper aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities we have entered into commodity swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales under the swap agreements we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time with regard to our option agreements we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors put options and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings call options additionally we have entered into collars combination of a put and call option with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling we record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings as required all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used the fair value position of our commodity derivatives would decrease by approximately 5 million at december 31 2006 and by approximately 10 million at december 31 2005 if there were an instantaneous 10 increase across all commodities and applicable yield curves

 item 9b   other information tableend  

at the meeting of the management development and compensation committee of the board of directors on december 14 2006 the compensation committee set the fiscal 2007 performance criteria for our executive officers for annual bonuses paid under our annual incentive plan pursuant to the criteria approved by the committee the executives’ target bonuses are based entirely on financial measures although the committee may exercise its discretion to increase or decrease an executives’ potential bonus by up to 25 based on personal performance additionally the annual incentive plan provides that in no event will any award made under the plan exceed 05 of the company’s pretax income from operations each of the executives is party to an employment agreement with the company that sets forth such executive’s target incentive bonus which ranges from 50 to 115 of the executives’ annual base salary further the agreements provide that the executives’ actual bonuses may range from zero to two times the target bonus depending on the achievement of the goals set forth under the annual incentive plan 

 

the 2007 criteria set by the committee consists of financial measures divided equally between an earnings per share measure calculated for the company applicable to all executives and a cash flow target for purposes of the performance criteria “cash flow” is calculated as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures the cash flow targets are company based for corporate executives and calculated for each individual group for the group executives the committee may in its discretion adjust actual results by eliminating charges for restructuring extraordinary unusual or nonrecurring items discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles or changes in tax laws in determining whether the criteria have been met 

 

also on december 14 2006 the committee determined to make changes to the awards issued as part of its longterm incentive program beginning in 2007 rather than granting an equal number of restricted stock unit awards and performance share unit awards to executives the total value of the awards will be allocated 25 for restricted stock units and 75 performance share units additionally rather than ratable vesting over a fouryear period 100 of the restricted stock units will vest at the end of a threeyear service period

 item 1 business tableend general 

  the financial statements in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary waste management inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” refer to waste management inc its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities when we use the term “wmi” we are referring only to the parent holding company 

  we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america using our vast network of assets and employees we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services through our subsidiaries we provide collection transfer recycling disposal and wasteto energy services in providing these services we actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment including recovering and processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities during 2005 none of our customers accounted for more than 1 of our operating revenue we employed approximately 50000 people as of december 31 2005 

  our company’s goals are targeted at serving five key stakeholders our customers our employees the environment the communities in which we work and our shareholders our goals are 

   wmi was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger the oakbrook illinois based waste services company formerly known as waste management inc became a whollyowned subsidiary of wmi and changed its name to waste management holdings inc “wm holdings” at the same time our parent company changed its name to waste management inc like wmi wm holdings is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries 

  our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street suite 4000 houston texas 77002 our telephone number at that address is 713 5126200 our website address is httpwwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wmi” 

strategy 

  we have been working to improve our organization by concentrating on operational excellence and profitability rather than on revenue growth to accomplish this we continuously review our operations and identify our best practices adopt these best practices as the standards for all of our operating units and then work continuously to improve them 

  we are focusing our attention on executing strategies based on four objectives revenue growth through pricing initiatives lowering operating and selling general and administrative costs through process standardi 

1 zation and productivity improvements improving our portfolio of assets through our “fix or seek exit strategy” program and seeking acquisition candidates and generating strong and consistent cash flow from operations that can be returned to shareholders 

   our current revenue growth and pricing excellence strategy centers around attaining a return on invested capital that appropriately captures our cost of capital the risks we take in our business and our unique disposal assets we have been using an increasingly more disciplined approach to pricing where we carefully analyze our operations and make decisions based on market specific information including our costs in 2005 this was most clearly seen in our collection lines of business where we focused on new business pricing minimizing price rollbacks and charging an environmental cost recovery fee and a revised fuel surcharge in addition we have implemented fee programs to recover the costs we incur for items such as the collection of past due balances container delivery and other services in the second quarter 2005 we expanded our landfill pricing study which was originally implemented in january 2005 to cover 30 landfills to include 23 transfer stations and essentially all of the operating sites in four of our market areas by the end of 2005 we had implemented our findings from the study at nearly all of our landfills and transfer stations we believe our success in pricing as demonstrated by our increasing internal revenue growth is a direct result of our execution of these pricing strategies 

   we remain committed to finding the best practices throughout our organization and standardizing those practices and processes throughout the company in the second half of 2005 our focus on improving internalization rates standardizing operating and maintenance practices and emphasizing the importance of safety translated into cost savings across our organization we intend to continue to identify operational improvements that will provide cost reductions in 2006 and beyond in some cases we have determined that to achieve these operational improvements it is necessary to put in place new information systems or other tools that will provide our people with the necessary resources to make better decisions and work more efficiently for example in the fourth quarter of 2005 we announced that we had entered into agreements for new revenue management software and support services although that decision required an asset impairment charge we believe that this system will provide the best capabilities and functionality of the available alternatives 

  additionally in the third quarter of 2005 we unveiled plans to simplify and streamline our organizational structure we eliminated duplicative administrative functions that were in our field and corporate organization and eliminated one of our reporting groups and integrated those operations into our other groups as a way to further reduce administrative costs and improve efficiencies this affirms our commitment to making the choices that will benefit our company in the longterm which includes improving the way we operate in order to achieve cost savings 

   as announced in early 2005 we have been reviewing our underperforming and nonstrategic operations and assessing them for opportunities to improve their performance in the third quarter of 2005 we announced that our board of directors had approved a plan to divest of underperforming operations representing annual gross revenues of approximately 400 million the company has since identified additional operations representing over 500 million in annual gross revenues that also may be divested as part of the program the ultimate sale of any of the operations is dependent on several factors including identifying interested purchasers negotiating the terms and conditions of the sales and obtaining regulatory approvals 

  in addition to our focus on divesting underperforming operations we continue to look for acquisitions and other investments to improve our current operations’ performance and enhance and expand our services in 2006 we expect to make investments in our landfill gasto energy and medical waste programs as well as 

2 land purchases that we believe will benefit future expansion efforts all of which are complementary to our existing operations 

   we continue to use the cash that we generate not only to reinvest in our business but also to return value to our stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividend payments in late 2004 our board of directors approved our current threeyear capital allocation program which authorizes up to 12 billion of combined stock repurchases and dividend payments in 2005 2006 and 2007 under this program we repurchased over 700 million of shares and paid out dividends of nearly 450 million in 2005 in december 2005 our board of directors declared the first quarterly dividend payment for 2006 of 022 per share which is an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to allocate to our dividend program for the third straight year in january 2006 we repurchased over nine million shares through an accelerated stock repurchase agreement described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  we plan to continuously seek out the best information from our experiences our employees and our customers and develop additional strategies and additional ways to execute our strategies that will bring us closer to achieving our goals however we believe that once a goal has been met it is time to set a new higher goal so that we continue to build on the momentum we have created through these strategies 

operations 

   we provide integrated waste management services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers throughout the united states puerto rico and canada our core business includes collection disposal transfer wasteto energy and recycling services we manage and evaluate our operations through six operating groups four of which are organized by geographic area and the other two are organized by function the geographic groups include our eastern midwest southern and western groups and the two functional groups are our wheelabrator group which provides wasteto energy services and our recycling group we also provide additional waste management services that are not managed through our six groups these services include thirdparty subcontracted services managed by our national accounts organization methane gas recovery portable toilet and fence rentals and other miscellaneous services and are presented in this report as “other” 

  the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the 2004 and 2003 information has been presented in conformity with our current year presentation more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 

 3   the services we provide include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wheelabrator wasteto energy facilities and independent power production plants recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

   collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to a transfer station or disposal site we generally provide collection services under two types of arrangements 

   landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america and we have the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are built and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are operated under prescribed procedures a landfill must be maintained to meet federal state or provincial and local regulations the operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes 

  all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill we believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using third party disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited 

  we also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under federal environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must issue permits for all hazardous waste 

4 landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform wastes into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous wastes in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

  we owned or operated 277 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2005 compared with 280 solid waste landfills and six hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2004 the landfills that we operate but do not own are generally operated under a lease agreement or an operating contract the differences between the two arrangements usually relate to the owner of the landfill operating permit generally with a lease agreement the permit is in our name and we operate the landfill for its entire life making payments to the lessor who is generally a private landowner based either on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received we are generally responsible for closure and postclosure requirements under our lease agreements for operating contracts the owner of the property generally a municipality usually owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term which may be the life of the landfill the property owner is generally responsible for closure and postclosure obligations under our operating contracts 

  based on remaining permitted capacity as of december 31 2005 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 26 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are currently seeking expansion permits at 65 of our landfills for which we consider expansions to be likely although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 35 years when considering remaining permitted capacity the expansion capacity we consider likely and projected annual disposal volume at december 31 2005 and 2004 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

 5   the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 in millions 

  

   the number of landfills we own or operate segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and likely expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume as of december 31 2005 was as follows 

   the volume of waste as measured in tons that we received in 2005 and 2004 at all of our landfills is shown below in thousands 

 6  

   when a landfill we own or operate i reaches its permitted waste capacity ii is permanently capped and iii receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency management of the site including for any remediation activities is generally transferred to our closed sites management group in addition to the 283 active landfills we managed at december 31 2005 we also managed 184 closed landfills 

  transfer at december 31 2005 we owned or operated 370 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other thirdparty waste haulers the solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites 

  access to transfer stations is often critical to third party haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in close proximity to their collection operations fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred the distance to the disposal site and general market factors 

  the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations and iii we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our disposal sites 

  the transfer stations that we operate but do not own are generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for all of the regulatory requirements in accordance with the lease and operating agreements terms 

  wheelabrator through wheelabrator we own or operate 17 wasteto energy facilities and six independent power production plants “ipps” that are located in the northeast and in florida california and washington 

  at our wasteto energy facilities solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into highpressure steam which is either sold or used to generate electricity our wasteto energy facilities are capable of processing up to 24000 tons of solid waste each day in both 2005 and 2004 our wasteto energy facilities received 78 million tons of solid waste or approximately 21300 tons per day 

  our ipps convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam which is either sold or used to generate electricity the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining 

  our wasteto energy facilities and ipps sell steam to industrial and commercial users steam that is not sold is used to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities fees at our wasteto energy facilities and ipps are generally subject to the terms and conditions of longterm contracts interim adjustments to the prices for 

7 steam and electricity under these longterm contracts are made for changes in market conditions such as inflation natural gas prices and other general market factors 

  recycling our recycling group focuses on improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs within communities and industries as of september 30 2005 we acquired the remaining minority interests in recycle america alliance llc making our recycling group a whollyowned organization in addition to our recycling group our four geographic operating groups provide certain recycling services that are embedded within the groups’ other operations and therefore not included within the recycling group’s financial results 

  recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following 

   recycling fees are influenced by frequency of collection type and volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors 

  our recycling group purchases recyclable materials processed in our mrfs from various sources including third parties and other operating subsidiaries of wmi the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the finished goods to our customers the price our recycling group pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” and is based upon the price we receive for sales of finished goods and local market conditions as a result higher commodity prices increase our revenues and increase the rebates we pay to our suppliers 

  other we provide inplant services in which we outsource our employees to provide full service waste management to customers at their plants through our upstream division our vertically integrated waste management operations allow us to provide customers with full management of their waste including identifying recycling opportunities minimizing their waste determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and transporting and disposing of their waste 

  we also develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be 

8 gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel the united states environmental protection agency “epa” endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource in the same category as wind solar and geothermal resources landfill gas is an important part of renewable energy portfolios for communities utilities and industries we actively pursue landfill gas beneficial use projects and at december 31 2005 we were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 95 of our solid waste landfills at 59 of these landfills the processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives at 32 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes such as steam boilers cement kilns and utility plants at four landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

  in addition we rent and service portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet ®  and provide street and parking lot sweeping services 

competition 

  the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies private solid waste companies large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private wasteto energy companies we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills the municipalities and regional governmental authorities are often able to offer lower direct charges to the customer for the same service by subsidizing the cost of the service through the use of tax revenues and taxexempt financing generally however municipalities do not provide significant commercial and industrial collection or waste disposal 

  we compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other companies own or operate their own landfills to which they will send their waste we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and quality of services operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition based on quality of service and pricing under certain customer service contracts our ability to increase our prices or pass on cost increases to our customers may be limited from time to time competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts 

employees 

  at december 31 2005 we had approximately 50000 fulltime employees of which approximately 7500 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance were in operations approximately 13700 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

financial assurance and insurance obligations 

   municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require the contracting party to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits municipal and governmental waste management contracts typically require performance bonds or bank letters of credit to secure performance various forms of financial assurance are also required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure postclosure and remedial obligations at our landfills 

  we establish financial assurance in different ways including escrow accounts funded by revenues during the operational life of a facility letters of credit surety bonds trust agreements financial guarantees and 

9 insurance the instrument decision is based on several factors most importantly the jurisdiction contractual requirements market factors and availability of capacity the surety industry shows signs of recovery and appears to be moving forward with cautious optimism the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2005 

  

 

 

 10 

   the assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the closure postclosure and remedial obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established other than these permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

   we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy our general liability workers’ compensation and auto insurance programs have per incident deductibles of 25 million 1 million and 20000 respectively effective january 1 2006 we increased the per incident deductible for our auto insurance programs to 1 million we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2005 are summarized in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

regulation 

  our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the environmental protection agency “epa” and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations 

  because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain necessary required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain necessary governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to modification suspension or revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage 

  the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below 

 11 

 

 

 12    there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are stricter than comparable federal laws and regulations when not otherwise preempted by federal law additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling 

  various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outof state waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance was unconstitutional however other courts have refused to apply the supreme court precedent in various circumstances in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outof state or outof jurisdiction waste these congressional efforts have to date been unsuccessful the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outof state or outof jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level or the courts’ interpretation or validation of flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid waste management services 

  many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend   when we make statements containing projections about our accounting and finances plans and objectives for the future future economic performance or when we make statements containing any other projections or estimates about our assumptions relating to these types of statements we are making forwardlooking statements these statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results we make these statements in an effort to keep stockholders and the public informed about our business and have based them on our current expectations about future events you should view such statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

13   outlined below are some of the risks that we face and that could affect our business and financial position for 2006 and beyond however they are not the only risks that we face there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position 

   we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists of large national waste management companies and local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and taxexempt financing is more readily available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage 

  in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts when this happens we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or retain our customers resulting in a negative impact to our yield on base business 

   in recent years we have implemented several profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our revenues and continue to seek ways to reduce our selling general and administrative and operating expenses while we have generally been successful in reducing our selling general and administrative costs managing subcontractor costs and managing the effect of fuel price increases these initiatives may not be sufficient even as our revenues increase if we are unable to control variable costs or increases to our fixed costs in the future we will be unable to maintain or expand our margins in recent periods rising employeerelated costs and expenses including health care and other employee benefits such as unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation have negatively impacted our measures to reduce costs 

   we have announced several programs and strategies that we have implemented or planned to improve our margins and operating results for example we have implemented price increases and environmental fees and continue our fuel surcharge programs all of which have increased our internal revenue growth additionally we have announced plans to divest of underperforming assets if we cannot improve their profitability it is possible that we may lose volumes as a result of price increases or that we may not be able to increase prices or pass on increased costs to all of our customers due to contractual restraints additionally we may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming operations which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low margin businesses if we are not able to fully implement our plans for any reason many of which are out of our control we may not see the expected improvements in our income from operations or our operating margins 

   our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year can actually increase our revenues in 

14 the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when electrical demand is generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wasteto energy facilities 

  our business is affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are also outside of our control including interest rates and consumer confidence we have 30 billion of debt as of december 31 2005 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the combined impact of our variable rate taxexempt bonds and our interest rate swap agreements therefore any increase in interest rates can significantly increase our expenses additionally although our services are of an essential nature a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues we also face risks related to other adverse external factors such as the ability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect that significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may have on such ability 

  any of the factors described above could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally due to these and other factors operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period 

   we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of drinking water sources or soil under current law we could even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past and may in the future become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which 

   we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments 

   stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large number of complex laws rules orders and 

15 interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as 

   regulations affecting the siting design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial 

  in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

   the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have ranged from an increase of 41 to a decrease of 2 we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations and price escalations or reductions in the supply will likely increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on income from operations and cash flows additionally as fuel prices increase many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs we may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising costs of fuel although there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that such programs will be successful 

  additionally our current effective tax rate is estimated to be significantly lower than statutory tax rates due in part to section 29 tax credits we realize from our landfill gas sales and investments in coalbased synthetic fuel partnerships the ability to earn section 29 tax credits is tied to an average benchmark oil price determined by the internal revenue service and the credits are phased out as the benchmark average price increases higher fuel prices or continued high fuel prices will phase out our credits and increase our effective tax rate which will result in higher tax expense 

   the amount of insurance required to be maintained for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels we face the risk of incurring liabilities for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby allowing us to manage our selfinsurance exposure 

16 associated with claims to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results 

  in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to environmental closure and postclosure liabilities we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance or fund trust and escrow accounts we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations we do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future however we are aware of recent increases in the cost of surety bonds and in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance these types of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain which could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired a pending acquisition is not completed a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility acquisition or project we reduce the charge against earnings by any portion of the capitalized expenditures and advances that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise 

  in future periods we may be required to incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or due to other events that cause impairments depending on the magnitude any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

   our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard “occ” and old newsprint “onp” we enter into commodity price derivatives in an effort to mitigate some of the variability in cash flows from the sales of recyclable materials at floating prices in the past three years the yearoveryear changes in the quarterly average market prices for occ ranged from a decrease of as much as 37 to an increase of as much as 36 the same comparisons for onp have ranged from a decrease of as much as 17 to an increase of as much as 34 these fluctuations can affect future operating income and cash flows additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers based on the market prices of commodities we purchase therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase 

  additionally there may be significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energy related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wasteto energy and independent power production plant operations the marketing and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and wasteto energy operations are generally pursuant to longterm sales agreements therefore market fluctuations do not have a significant effect on these operations in the shortterm however revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly electricity prices have ranged from increases of as much as 12 to decreases of as much as 4 

   our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting in addition some state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard wastes at landfills or wasteto energy facilities although such mandates are a useful tool to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wasteto energy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wasteto energy facilities at full capacity as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wasteto energy services our recycling operations benefit from these mandates but those operations generally generate much lower margins than our disposal operations 

   labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements work stoppages including strikes could ensue depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions our operating expenses could increase significantly which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

   we are currently involved in civil litigation and governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these matters is uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity 

   we may experience problems with either the operation of our current information technology systems or the development and deployment of new information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved we have purchased a new revenue management system and plan to begin piloting the system in the second half of 2006 we may encounter problems in the development or deployment of this system that could result in significant errors in or disruption of our billing processes additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable law and regulations 

   our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results in future periods 

   we currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures acquisitions and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary additional financings however materially adverse events could reduce our cash flows from operations our board of directors approved a capital allocation program that provides for up to 12 billion in aggregate dividend payments and 

18 share repurchases each year during 2005 2006 and 2007 and recently announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments to be 022 per share if our cash flows from operations were negatively affected we could be forced to reduce capital expenditures acquisition activity share repurchase activity or dividend declarations in these circumstances we instead may elect to incur more indebtedness if we made such an election there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable terms in these circumstances we would likely use our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs 

  our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants in the event our interest expense is more than expected due to higher interest rates or our ratio of debt to earnings as determined pursuant to the terms of the credit facility is more than expected we may not be in compliance with the covenants this would result in a default under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain waivers or amendments to the credit facility the lenders could choose to declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable which we may not be able to pay in full additionally any such default could cause a default under all of our other credit agreements and debt instruments any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december 31 2005 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors  the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

   waste management is the leading provider of comprehensive waste services in north america throughout 2005 we continued to build a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality reliable service safety and environmental protection by continuing to cultivate this reputation and focusing on quality customer service we accomplished our main financial objectives for 2005 of strong earnings growth margin expansion and improved cash flow we believe that our pricing initiatives which allowed us to grow our revenues by increasing our prices while maintaining solid volumes were largely responsible for our improved financial performance significant financial achievements during the year ended december 31 2005 include 

   cash flow  — free cash flow is a nongaap measure of financial performance that we include in our disclosures because we believe the production of free cash flow is an important measure of our liquidity and performance and because we believe our investors are interested in the cash we produce from nonfinancing activities that is available for our acquisition program share repurchase program scheduled debt reduction and the payment of dividends the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities we calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below in millions 

   the growth in our 2005 operating and free cash flow reflects the current year improvements in our operating results particularly those contributed by our increase in revenue from price which is discussed below 

  internal revenue growth  — internal revenue growth or irg is the change in our revenues from base business yield commodities electricity fuel surcharges and fees and volumes irg is an important indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase revenues from our existing operations our irg for the year was 37 and consisted primarily of improvement in base business yield and an increase in revenues related to our fuel surcharge program revenue growth from yield on base business is the combined effects on our revenues from the pricing activities of our collection transfer disposal and wasteto energy 

23 operations exclusive of volume changes our revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price increases but also includes i price decreases to retain customers ii changes in average price from new and lost business and iii certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided our revenue growth from base business yield for 2005 was 27 which is an increase of 2 percentage points from the prior year in addition our fuel surcharge program contributed 157 million or 13 to revenue growth in 2005 compared with 53 million or 05 in 2004 the revenues generated by the program in 2005 substantially recovered the increase in our operating costs attributable to fuel 

  margin improvement  — we use our net income as a percentage of revenues and income from operations as a percentage of revenues to gauge performance for employee incentive awards and to determine the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and strategies our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as a percentage of revenues increased in 2005 to 90 from 74 in 2004 this increase is largely due to a tax benefit resulting from tax audit settlements our income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 131 in 2005 from 136 in 2004 on an increase of 558 million in revenue the decrease was caused primarily by 110 million of additional expenses in 2005 when compared with 2004 related to asset impairments and unusual items and restructuring excluding asset impairments and unusual items and restructuring charges for both periods our income from operations as a percentage of revenues improved by 03 percentage points 

  this improvement in our income from operations as a percentage of revenues is primarily a result of our increased revenue on essentially flat volumes we experienced a 403 million increase in our operating expenses from the prior year but as a percentage of revenue the measure increased by only 03 percentage points to 66 as compared with 2004 during the second half of 2005 our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 04 percentage points when compared with the comparable prior year period with the increased prices of fuel and other higher variable operating costs we believe that these are positive results brought about primarily by our focus on implementing programs to recover our own higher costs our selling general and administrative expenses in 2005 increased by 9 million but as a percentage of revenue actually decreased by 03 percentage points to 98 we achieved our goal of reducing selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue to below 10 as a result of both our revenue growth and our restructuring to streamline our business as a result of higher revenues on relatively flat volumes our depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 03 percentage points as compared with the prior period although there remains work to be done we believe our 2005 operating margins demonstrate our pricing progress as well as our continued efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations 

   as part of our continuing efforts to improve our operations we have developed a program to divest underperforming and nonstrategic operations in the third quarter of 2005 we identified operations with annual gross revenues of over 400 million for potential divestiture under this program we recently announced that we have identified additional assets representing over 500 million in annual gross revenues that may also be sold as part of the divestiture program while it is too early to assess the financial impact of the divestitures and whether there may be any material asset impairments as a result of the program we remain confident that our “fix or seek an exit strategy” approach to any underperforming operations will benefit our financial results in the long term additionally we are continuing our focus on acquisitions and other investments we intend to make investments in those locations and lines of businesses that offer superior margins and return on capital 

  our company is proud of the accomplishments made in 2005 we are focused on building on the momentum that we experienced this year to continue to expand our operating margins increase our return on invested capital and generate strong cash flows 

   as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following reclassifications have been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year financial information with the current period presentation 

  cash balances  — during 2004 we began making investments in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes which are debt instruments with longterm scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates through december 31 2004 we included these investments in “cash and cash equivalents” as a result of guidance issued in early 2005 associated with these types of securities we determined that these investments were more appropriately classified as shortterm investments which are a component of current “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets accordingly in our accompanying consolidated financial statements we have decreased our “cash and cash equivalents” and increased our current “other assets” by 19 million at december 31 2004 

  gross purchases and sales of these investments are presented within “cash flows from investing activities” in our statements of cash flows additionally in our 2004 and 2003 consolidated statements of cash flows relatively insignificant purchases and sales of other shortterm investments were included on a net basis within “cash flows from investing activities — other” this additional activity is now reflected within purchases and sales of shortterm investments in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 

  segments  — as discussed in notes 2 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2005 we eliminated our canadian group office and the management of our canadian operations was allocated among our eastern midwest and western groups we have allocated the operating results of our canadian operations to the eastern midwest and western groups for 2003 2004 and the first half of 2005 to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our operations this reorganization also resulted in the centralization of certain group office functions the administrative costs associated with these functions were included in the measurement of income from operations for our reportable segments through august 2005 when the integration of these functions with our existing centralized processes was completed beginning in september 2005 these administrative costs have been included in the income from operations of our corporate organization the reallocation of these costs has not significantly affected the operating results of our reportable segments for the periods presented 

  certain other reclassifications have also been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year information with the current period presentation the supplementary financial information included in this section has been updated to reflect these changes 

   in preparing our financial statements we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets liabilities stockholders’ equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset impairments and selfinsurance reserves and recoveries as described below 

  landfills  — the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “sfas no 143” based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and postclosure activities because 

25 landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations 

 

 26 

 

   it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher final capping closure or postclosure rates or higher expenses or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we may be required to recognize an asset impairment if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

  environmental remediation liabilities  — under current laws and regulations we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business these costs include potentially responsible party “prp” investigation settlement certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site next we review the same information 

27 with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on 

   asset impairments  — our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization however accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group or an actual thirdparty valuation if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 

  typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include 

   if any of these or other indicators occur we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment several of these indicators are beyond our control and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur additionally estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below 

 28 

   selfinsurance reserves and recoveries  — we have retained a portion of the risks related to our automobile general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable

 29   the following table presents for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that the respective statement of operations line items has to operating revenues 

 30 

   our operating revenues in 2005 were 131 billion compared with 125 billion in 2004 and 116 billion in 2003 we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western wheelabrator which includes our wasteto energy facilities and independent power production plants or ipps and recycling groups these six operating groups are our reportable segments shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year from our six operating groups and our other waste services 

   our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer wheelabrator and recycling services some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees which are generally based on the weight volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semimonthly fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site and are normally billed monthly our wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our wasteto energy facilities and ipps and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam recycling revenue which is generated by our recycling group as well as our four geographic operating groups generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 

  the mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions 

 31   the following table provides details associated with the periodto period change in revenues in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes 

   base business  — in 2005 base business yield improvements were driven by our collection operations where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating group the significant base business yield improvements in the collection line of business are primarily the result of our continued focus on pricing initiatives as a means of increasing our margins cash flows and return on capital and to a lesser extent the adoption of a 1 environmental cost recovery fee which increased revenues by 33 million during 2005 our transfer business in the east and municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the south have also provided significant revenue growth from base business yield improvements throughout the year 

  during the second half of 2005 we received substantial yield contributions to revenues from our wasteto energy facilities these revenue improvements were largely due to significant increases in the rates charged for electricity under our longterm contracts with electric utilities these rates are generally indexed to natural gas prices which increased significantly in 2005 as a result of hurricane related production disruptions increased demand and increases in crude oil prices 

  the 2005 revenue improvements attributable to yield have been partially offset by a general decline in yield in special waste landfill disposal operations noted principally in our midwest and southern groups 

  in 2004 base business yield improvements contributed to increased revenues in our collection transfer and wasteto energy operations in our collection business the most substantial yield improvements during 2004 were in our industrial and residential operations where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout 2004 was positive it was affected by increased price competition particularly in the midwest and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the south the base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout 2004 were almost exclusively attributable to the eastern portion of the united states 

  base business yield increases during 2004 were partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations this decline was primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste particularly in the south and midwest which was partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal 

  commodity  — our revenues in 2005 declined due to price decreases in recycling commodities average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by 8 during the year from 85 per ton in 2004 to 78 per ton in 2005 average prices for old newsprint were also down by about 3 from 86 per ton in 2004 to 83 per ton in 2005 conversely our revenues in 2004 were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process 

32   a significant portion of revenues attributable to commodities is rebated to our suppliers of recyclable materials accordingly changes in our revenues due to fluctuations in commodity prices have a corresponding impact on our cost of goods sold 

  fuel surcharges and fees  — fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by 157 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and 53 million for the year ended december 31 2004 due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges the substantial current year increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be attributed to i increases in market prices for fuel ii an increase in the number of customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program and iii the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors during the year ended december 31 2005 increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices which are included within both operating expenses — subcontractor costs and operating expenses — fuel  were substantially recovered by our fuel surcharge program 

  volume  — volumerelated revenues are relatively flat when comparing 2005 with 2004 this is generally because of the combined impacts of i a decline in revenues associated with hurricanes ii increases in recycling and landfill disposal volumes and iii lower revenue from residential commercial and industrial collection volumes particularly in the east and midwest which can generally be attributed to our focus on improving our margins by increasing yield 

  our volumerelated revenues generated from hurricane related services were 56 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared with 115 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 59 million decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain of our operations in the gulf coast region during 2005 as a result of the severe destruction caused by hurricane katrina in addition much of our 2004 hurricane related revenues were associated with subcontracted services which generated comparatively lower margins in 2005 we generally elected not to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not support the required services with internal resources 

  when excluding the impacts of the hurricanes revenue due to volume increased 62 million or 05 during 2005 current year volumerelated revenue increases have largely been due to i increased recycling volumes provided by several new brokerage contracts ii increased landfill disposal volumes in the midwest west and south iii increased transfer station volumes in the west and the south and iv increased residential collection volumes in the west also included as a component of volumerelated revenue growth is revenue generated from our construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a municipality in our midwest group the revenue generated by this project was low margin and largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold  

  these revenue increases were largely offset by volume declines experienced in each line of business in the eastern portion of the united states and significant volume declines in our collection business in the midwest we believe volume declines in our collection and transfer businesses in the east and midwest can generally be attributed to our focus on improving base business yield and the price competition typical in these regions 

  during 2004 we experienced significant volumerelated revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses a substantial portion of volumerelated revenue growth was due to the volume increases experienced in industrial collection operations for each of our operating groups in the southern and western portions of the united states our residential collection transfer construction and demolition disposal and special waste landfill disposal operations also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout 2004 

  acquisitions and divestitures  — during the year ended december 31 2005 acquisitions contributed 112 million of additional revenues offset by a decline in revenue of 62 million during the year as a result of divestitures we expect the decrease in revenues attributable to divestitures to increase in future periods as a result of our plan to divest underperforming or nonstrategic operations 

  in 2004 the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from allied waste industries inc in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 other acquisitions of recycling transfer and wasteto energy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of 2003 also provided increases in revenues during 2004 

   our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below which include salaries and wages related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment vehicles and facilities and related labor costs iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities v costs of goods sold which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties viii landfill operating costs which include landfill remediation costs leachate and methane collection and treatment other landfill site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement obligations ix risk management costs which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs which include among other costs equipment and facility rent and property taxes 

  the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

   labor and related benefits  — when comparing 2005 with 2004 these costs have increased due to i salary and wage increases as a result of annual merit increases ii a general increase in employee health care and benefit costs iii an increase in the costs attributable to contract labor used at our material recovery facilities due to acquisitions and iv increased payroll taxes in 2004 the yearoveryear increase in costs was generally due to higher salary costs and higher hourly wage and overtime costs 

  for purposes of the above disclosure the presentation of prior years has been conformed to our current year presentation that excludes labor costs related to fleet and container maintenance facilities as well as workers’ compensation costs labor costs attributable principally to our fleet and container maintenance facilities of 395 million for 2004 and 376 million for 2003 have been reclassified as a component of the caption “maintenance and repairs” and workers’ compensation costs of 131 million for 2004 and 139 million for 2003 have been included as a component of the caption “risk management” 

  transfer and disposal costs  — in 2005 the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at third party transfer stations or landfills declined due to our focus on improving internalization these costs significantly increased in 2004 as compared with 2003 due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions 

  maintenance and repairs  — increases in these costs are attributable to i higher parts and supplies costs which were driven by changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our wasteto energy facilities and 

34 increased volumes in our southern and western groups ii increases in the cost of lubes and oils and iii increases in the labor costs associated with our maintenance and repairs 

  subcontractor costs  — throughout 2005 and 2004 we have experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to third party subcontractors subcontractor cost increases attributable to higher fuel costs were significantly offset by the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program which is reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues  

  additionally in 2005 we incurred additional transportation costs due to increased volumes in subcontracted work particularly in our national accounts organization and western group the current year cost increases were partially offset by a yearoveryear decline in the utilization of subcontractors to assist in providing hurricane related services 

  in addition to the significant increase in subcontractor costs related to hurricanerelated services during 2004 we also experienced increases due to i the impact of acquisitions ii increased thirdparty transportation costs in our western group due to the service requirements of certain event work and iii additional transportation costs in our eastern group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills 

  cost of goods sold  — these costs are primarily for rebates paid to our suppliers which are driven by the market prices of recyclable commodities in 2005 we experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities than in prior years this decrease in pricing was more than offset by increased recycling volumes in 2005 due to several new brokerage contracts and recent acquisitions in 2005 the increase in cost of goods sold was also partially due to costs incurred to construct an integrated waste facility for a municipality in the midwest group the increase in 2004 over 2003 is directly related to the yearoveryear increase in market prices of recyclable commodities 

  fuel  — we experienced an average increase of 059 per gallon for 2005 as compared with 2004 and in 2004 we experienced an average increase of 030 per gallon for 2004 over 2003 while we recover a significant portion of the cost increases incurred as a result of higher fuel prices through our fuel surcharge program increased fuel costs continue to negatively affect our operating margins revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues 

  disposal and franchise fees and taxes  — these cost increases are the result of increased volumes and increased rates for mandated fees and taxes certain of these cost increases are passed through to our customers and have been reflected as fee yield increases within operating revenues 

  landfill operating costs  — these cost increases have generally been related to higher site maintenance leachate collection monitoring and testing and closure and postclosure expenses 

  risk management  — over the last two years we have been successful in maintaining these costs at a consistent level largely due to reduced workers’ compensation costs which can partially be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates 

  other operating expenses  — the increase in these costs since 2004 can be attributed to i hurricane katrina related support costs particularly in louisiana where we built camp waste management to house and feed hundreds of our employees who worked in the new orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts ii a yearoveryear decrease in the realization of gains on sales of assets iii costs incurred during 2005 attributable to labor strikes in new jersey and canada and iv an increase in costs generated by a surety bonding company we have consolidated since the third quarter of 2003 under the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” 

  the primary reason for the decrease during 2004 as compared with 2003 is the december 31 2003 consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities from which we lease three wasteto energy facilities the consolidation of these entities is as a result of our fin 46 implementation prior to the consolidation of these entities we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases the consolidation of these entities therefore resulted in a decline in rental expense in 2004 which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation interest expense and minority interest expense 

   our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs which include salaries related insurance and benefits contract labor payroll taxes and equitybased compensation ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other general and administrative expenses which include among other costs facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunications advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing 

  the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

   labor and related benefits  — throughout 2005 we experienced increases in i noncash compensation costs associated with recent changes in equitybased compensation provided for by our longterm incentive plan and ii group insurance costs largely due to general health care cost increases in both 2005 and 2004 these costs increased yearoveryear due to higher salaries and hourly wages driven by annual merit raises as well as higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance on a yearoveryear basis also contributing to the increase in labor costs in 2004 when compared with 2003 was an increase in commissions paid to our sales personnel declines in our use of contract labor particularly for corporate support functions partially offset these cost increases for both 2005 and 2004 additionally during the second half of 2005 we began to realize the benefits of our july 2005 reorganization which simplified our management structure to increase the accountability and responsibility of our market areas our ability to streamline our organization in this manner can be attributed to our continued focus on creating efficiencies with our key personnel our 2005 and 2003 restructurings have been a result of identifying the most effective utilization of our resources and are discussed in the restructuring section below 

  professional fees  — in 2004 we experienced an increase in professional fees as a result of higher litigation and defense costs as well as consulting fees that were largely due to our implementation of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the decline in our litigation and defense costs in the current year is due to several cases winding down and either being settled or moving into the settlement stages consulting costs associated with sarbanesoxley compliance have also decreased as we move from the implementation phase to continued monitoring and testing in 2005 an increase in consulting fees related to our pricing initiatives and an increase in our computer support costs have partially offset these reductions 

  provision for bad debts  — as a percentage of revenue these costs have continued to decline largely due to improved collection efforts the increase in these costs in 2005 was generally attributable to a yearoveryear increase in thirdparty collection costs 

  other selling general and administrative costs  — although we did not see a significant fluctuation in these costs when comparing 2005 with 2004 increased sales and marketing costs related to our national advertising campaign did result in a notable increase in these expenses in the current year the recognition of favorable settlements for legal disputes during 2003 drove the increase in these costs from 2003 to 2004 

   depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment including assets recorded due to capital leases on a straightline basis from three to 50 years ii amortization of landfill costs 

36 including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction closure and postclosure on a unitsof consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsof consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 

  depreciation and amortization expense increased by 25 million during the year ended december 31 2005 this increase is largely attributable to a 21 million charge to landfill amortization recorded to adjust the amortization periods of nine of our landfills these adjustments reflect cumulative corrections resulting from reducing the amortization periods of the landfills and were necessary to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations we determined that the impact of these adjustments was not material to 2005 or prior periods’ results of operations 

  our 2005 landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization also increased when compared with 2004 as a result of the comparative impact of landfill amortization reductions recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping closure and post closure obligations during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 landfill amortization expense was reduced by 12 million and 20 million respectively with the majority of the reduced expense resulting from revised estimates associated with final capping changes similar adjustments did not significantly affect our landfill amortization expense in 2003 

  depreciation and amortization expense increased by 71 million during the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with 2003 the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2004 was primarily related to i an increase in our landfill amortization rate net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs of 019 per ton and to a lesser extent an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes ii increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprisewide software systems into service during the latter half of 2003 and iii increased depreciation expense for our wheelabrator group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities 

   management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure these reviews have highlighted efficiencies and cost savings we could capture by restructuring the most significant cost savings we have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “selling general and administrative” expenses the following summarizes the organizational changes that have occurred during the last three years to reach our current structure 

  in february 2003 we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization as a result we incurred 20 million in onetime employee severance and benefit costs the operational efficiencies provided by the february 2003 organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in june 2003 we recorded an additional 24 million of pretax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during 2003 in 2004 we recorded a 1 million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with the 2003 workforce reductions 

  during the third quarter of 2005 we reorganized and simplified our organizational structure by eliminating certain support functions performed at the group or corporate office we also eliminated the canadian group office which reduced the number of our operating groups from seven to six this reorganization has reduced costs at the group and corporate offices and increased the accountability of our market areas we recorded 28 million of pretax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure principally for employee severance and benefit costs 

   the following table summarizes the major components of “asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions 

   the significant transactions and events resulting in asset impairments net gains on divestitures and other financial statement impacts within “asset impairments and unusual items” in our consolidated statements of operations during the three years ended december 31 2005 are discussed below 

  year ended december 31 2005 

  asset impairments  — during the second quarter of 2005 we recorded a 35 million charge for the impairment of the pottstown landfill located in west pottsgrove township pennsylvania we determined that an impairment was necessary after the pennsylvania environmental hearing board upheld a denial by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection of a permit application for a vertical expansion at the landfill after the denial was upheld the company reviewed the options available at the pottstown landfill and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options after such evaluation and considering the length of time required for the appeal process and the permit application review we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial this decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the permitting delays which would hinder our ability to fully utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill’s required closure in 2010 we continued to operate the pottstown landfill using existing permitted airspace through the landfill’s permit expiration date of october 2005 the pottstown landfill had not been a significant contributor to our recent earnings nor do we expect the expansion denial to have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows 

  through june 30 2005 our “property and equipment” had included approximately 80 million of accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system approximately 59 million of these costs were specifically associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use while the remaining costs were associated with the general efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our existing applications and hardware the development efforts associated with our revenue management system were suspended in 2003 since that time there have been changes in the viable software alternatives available to address our current needs during the third quarter of 2005 we concluded our assessment of potential revenue management system options as a result we entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the license implementation and maintenance of certain of its applications software including waste and recycling functionality we believe that these newly licensed applications when fully implemented will provide substantially better capabilities and functionality than the software we were developing our plan to implement this newly licensed software resulted in a 59 million charge in the third quarter of 2005 for the software that had been under development and capitalized costs associated with the development efforts specific to that software 

  during the fourth quarter of 2005 we recognized an 18 million charge for asset impairments this charge was primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our eastern group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the impairment of capitalized software costs related to two applications we decided not to develop further 

  net gains on divestitures  — during the first quarter of 2005 we recognized a 39 million gain as a result of the divestiture of a landfill in ontario canada which was required as a result of a divestiture order from the canadian competition bureau during the remainder of 2005 we recognized a total of 40 million in 

38 gains as a result of the divestiture of operations with the exception of our divestiture of the ontario canada landfill our divestitures during 2005 were generally part of our plan to review underperforming or nonstrategic operations and to either improve their performance or dispose of the operations 

  total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended december 31 2005 were 172 million of which 140 million was received in cash 23 million was in the form of a note receivable and 9 million was in the form of nonmonetary assets we do not believe that these divestitures are material either individually or in the aggregate and we do not expect these divestitures to materially affect our consolidated financial position or future results of operations or cash flows 

  other  — during the first quarter of 2005 we recognized a charge of approximately 16 million for the impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of stockholders that opted not to participate in the 2000 settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998 and 1999 activity during the third quarter of 2005 we settled our ongoing defense costs and any future indemnity obligations for four former officers of wm holdings related to legacy litigation brought by the sec against such former officers as a result we recorded a 268 million charge for the funding of the court ordered distribution to our shareholders for the former officers’ settlement of the litigation as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements this settlement agreement resulted in a distribution of 275 million to wmi shareholders of record as of august 25 2005 

  these charges were partially offset by the recognition of a 12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended december 31 2005 which was primarily for adjustments to our receivables and estimated obligations for nonsolid waste operations divested in 1999 and 2000 

  year ended december 31 2004 

  for 2004 the significant items included within “asset impairments and unusual items” were i 17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs ii 12 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain portolet ® operations and iii 18 million in miscellaneous net gains which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated obligations associated with nonsolid waste services which were divested in 1999 and 2000 

  year ended december 31 2003 

  for 2003 the significant items included within “asset impairments and unusual items” were 5 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and 13 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to divested operations in the western group 

   the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended december 31 for each respective period and provides explanations of factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments’ operating results in millions 

 39   eastern  — operating income was relatively flat when comparing 2005 with 2004 current year operating income has been favorably affected by base business yield improvement particularly in the collection and transfer lines of business and recent tuckin acquisitions these operational improvements were offset by i the recognition of a net charge of 44 million to “asset impairments and unusual items” which was driven by the impairment of the pottstown landfill and ii additional operating costs of 9 million attributable to a sevenweek labor strike in new jersey in the first quarter of 2005 in addition our focus on improving base business yield has resulted in partially offsetting volume declines during 2005 which reflects the competitive nature of the region and our decision to concentrate on higher margin revenues 

  the improvement in operating income from 2003 to 2004 was driven primarily by i revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business partially offset by volume declines in transfer residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year ii higher operating expenses incurred in 2003 as compared with 2004 due to the first quarter’s harsh weather conditions and iii acquisitions these earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill 

  midwest  — the current year increase in income from operations was primarily due to revenue growth associated with increased base business yield for the collection line of business which was driven principally by residential collection operations also positively affecting results compared with the prior year was a decline in landfill amortization expense generally as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations however our focus on improving base business yield has resulted in partially offsetting volume declines during 2005 

  operating income between 2003 and 2004 was relatively flat the slight increase in operating income in 2004 can largely be attributed to higher operating expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2003 due to harsh winter weather conditions 

  southern  — strong internal revenue growth contributed significantly to the increase in income from operations during 2005 the most significant revenue growth was associated with base business yield improvements in the collection line of business and volumerelated revenue growth in the transfer and landfill disposal lines of business in addition 13 million of the increase in income from operations was attributable to gains recognized on the divestiture of operations during 2005 these increases were partially offset by i a decline in earnings related to hurricanes largely due to the temporary suspension of operations in the areas affected by hurricane katrina ii the effects of higher landfill amortization costs generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations iii higher landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations and iv increases in salaries and wages 

  operating income in 2004 was favorably affected by i positive internal revenue growth largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations ii acquisitions iii increased revenue during the second half of 2004 as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter iv favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2004 largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout 2004 and v various operating and administrative cost reductions these improvements were partially offset by a charge to “asset impairments and unusual items” for the writeoff of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of 2004 

  western  — the significant increase in income from operations in 2005 can partially be attributed to internal revenue growth which was driven by yield improvements in commercial and industrial collection operations and volume growth in residential collection and transfer operations in addition during 2005 we recognized 24 million of gains associated with the divestiture of operations an increase of approximately 14 million from 2004 these earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs particularly for labor and related benefits 

  the increase in operating income between 2003 and 2004 was primarily attributable to revenue growth which was largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and 

40 average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations these gains were partially offset by i increased labor costs ii higher fuel costs not passed on to customers and iii increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs 

  wheelabrator  — the electric rates we charge to our customers at our wasteto energy facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of 2005 as a result of higher market prices for natural gas which increased significantly as a result of hurricanerelated production disruptions increased demand and increases in crude oil prices this increase in rates was the principal reason for the current year increase in wheelabrator’s income from operations the favorable impact of market prices for natural gas was partially offset by higher costs of goods sold and higher repair and maintenance costs due to the scope and timing of work performed in 2005 as compared with 2004 

  the increase in 2004 operating income was due in large part to i positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on longterm disposal contracts and ii the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december 31 2003 which increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs partially offset by increases in depreciation expense the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense wheelabrator’s 2003 operating results were favorably affected by an 11 million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented 

  recycling  — the decrease in income from operations in our recycling group during 2005 when compared with the prior year can generally be attributed to i an increase in the rebates paid to our suppliers as a result of increased competition ii costs related to the deployment of new software and iii higher subcontractor costs primarily related to increased distances traveled by thirdparty truckers 

  the comparability of operating results for the recycling group for all of the periods presented above has been affected by variances in the market prices for recyclable commodities during the three years ended december 31 2005 yearoveryear changes in the quarterly average market prices of occ and onp have ranged from a decrease of as much as 37 to an increase of as much as 36 in 2004 our operating revenues were favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for these commodities improvements in the market prices for recycable commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers 

  other  — the increase in income from operations from prior years is due to a pretax gain of 39 million resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in ontario canada during the first quarter of 2005 this impact is included in “asset impairments and unusual items” within our consolidated statement of operations as this landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005 reorganization historical financial information associated with its operations has not been allocated to our remaining reportable segments accordingly these impacts have been included in other partially offsetting this gain are certain yearend adjustments related to the reportable segments that are not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed 

  corporate  — the higher expenses in the current year were driven primarily by impairment charges of 68 million associated with capitalized software costs and 31 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters these items are discussed in the asset impairments and unusual items section above also contributing to the increase in expenses during 2005 were i an increase in noncash employee compensation costs associated with current year changes in equitybased compensation ii increases in employee health care costs iii salary and wage increases attributable to annual merit raises iv increased sales and marketing costs attributed to a national advertising campaign and consulting fees related to our pricing initiatives and v costs at corporate associated with our july 2005 restructuring charge and organizational changes which were partially offset by associated savings at corporate 

  higher professional fees contributed to the increase in 2004 expenses as compared with 2003 

   the following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions 

  

 

   net interest expense increased by 80 million from 2004 to 2005 due to a 41 million increase in interest expense and a 39 million decline in interest income the increase in interest expense in 2005 is generally related to a decline in the benefit of our interest rate swaps for all periods we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates the combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in net interest expense reductions of 39 million for 2005 90 million for 2004 and 96 million for 2003 the significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our interest rate swap agreements in 2005 is largely attributable to the increase in shortterm market interest rates our periodic interest obligations under our interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from the threemonth libor which has increased from 256 at december 31 2004 to 454 at december 31 2005 

  included in the 39 million in net reductions to interest expense realized in 2005 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is 42 million related to the amortization of terminated swaps our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by 41 million in 2006 37 million in 2007 and 33 million in 2008 

  the current year decrease in interest income is due primarily to interest income of 46 million realized during 2004 on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits the comparability of net interest expense for 2004 and 2003 was also significantly affected by this increase in interest income in 2004 

   in the first and second quarters of 2004 we acquired an equity interest in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities our equity interest in these facilities drives our equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities the yearoveryear increase in these losses is due to the timing of our initial investments in 2004 these equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for income taxes  if for any reason the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under section 29 of the internal revenue code we could unwind the related investment in the period that determination is made and not incur these equity losses in future periods additional information related to these investments is included in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

   on december 31 2003 we consolidated two special purpose type variable interest entities as a result of our implementation of fin 46 our minority interest expense for 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to the 

42 other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities the increase in minority interest expense as a result of the consolidation of these entities has been more than offset by related increases in our consolidated income from operations the increase in minority interest expense in 2005 when compared with 2004 was largely due to the improved operating results of the surety bonding company that we began consolidating in 2003 additional information related to these investments is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

   our other income and expense is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation on our canadian operations 

   we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 90 million in 2005 compared to a provision for income taxes of 247 million for 2004 and 404 million for 2003 for both 2005 and 2004 the effective income tax rates of 82 and 210 respectively are significantly less than the 2003 effective income tax rate of 360 partially due to the resolution of significant tax audits within those years the settlement of tax audits resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of 398 million in 2005 101 million in 2004 and 6 million in 2003 excluding the impact of tax audit settlements the effective tax rate for 2005 and 2004 would be 282 and 295 for 2005 and 2004 the decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate from 2003 is also attributable to our investments in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities that we obtained in the first half of 2004 the decrease in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in these coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities of 145 million in 2005 and 131 million in 2004 more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities these tax credits as well as our nonconventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills are available through 2007 pursuant to section 29 of the internal revenue code but may be phased out if the price of oil exceeds a threshold annual average price determined by the irs 

  for all periods a portion of the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes is due to state and local income taxes in 2005 we reduced our estimated effective state tax rate causing us to realize a benefit of 16 million related to the reduction of accumulated deferred taxes that was offset in part by additional income tax expense of 4 million to increase the accrued deferred tax as a result of a change in the provincial tax rate in quebec 

  in 2005 our overall tax benefit has been partially offset by the accrual of 34 million of taxes associated with our repatriation of 496 million of accumulated earnings and capital from certain of our canadian subsidiaries under the american jobs creation act of 2004 which is discussed further within the liquidity and capital resources section below see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

   on march 31 2004 we recorded a credit of 8 million net of taxes or 001 per diluted share to “cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles” as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by fin 46 see notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  in the first and fourth quarters of 2003 we recorded net of tax charges of 46 million and 43 million respectively to “cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles” for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below

 liquidity and capital resources 

   as an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations however we operate in a capitalintensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength in the past we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future these factors include 

   we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet iii refurbishments and improvements at wasteto energy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations and v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills we are also committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for up to 12 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during 2005 2006 and 2007 we also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business 

  on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” became law a provision of the act allowed us companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005 our chief executive officer and board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated 496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005 the repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings for a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

   the following is a summary of our cash shortterm investments available for use restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 in millions 

   cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less 

  for discussion regarding the december 31 2004 reclassification of cash refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and the basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information section above 

  shortterm investments available for use  — these investments include auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes which are debt instruments with longterm scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates the interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic marketing of the underlying securities through an auction process due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the shortterm nature of our investment in these securities they have been classified as current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

  restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations funds deposited in connection with landfill closure postclosure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits these balances are primarily included within “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

45 debt 

  revolving credit and letter of credit facilities  — the table below summarizes the credit capacity maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility principal letter of credit facilities and other credit arrangements as of december 31 2005 in millions 

  

   we have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs certain taxexempt bond issuances municipal and governmental waste management contracts closure and postclosure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits these facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit we expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs 

  canadian credit facility  — in november 2005 waste management of canada corporation one of our whollyowned subsidiaries entered into a threeyear credit facility agreement the agreement was entered into to facilitate wmi’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its canadian subsidiaries as discussed above the agreement which matures november 30 2008 allowed waste management of canada corporation to borrow up to canadian 410 million at any time on or before december 31 2005 any unused portion of the available credit was subject to immediate cancellation as of december 31 2005 the entire credit capacity of the facility had been advanced resulting in proceeds of us 339 million the advances do not accrue interest during their terms accordingly the proceeds we received were for the principal amount of us 353 million net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the advance the advances have a weighted average effective interest rate of 439 and mature either three months or twelve months from the date of issuance however the terms of the credit facility allow waste management of canada corporation to elect to renew the advances as of december 31 2005 we expect to repay us 86 million of outstanding advances with available cash and renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility accordingly 86 million of debt associated with these borrowings is classified as current in our december 31 2005 consolidated balance sheet and the remaining borrowings have been classified as longterm 

  senior notes  — as of december 31 2005 we had 52 billion of outstanding senior notes the notes have various maturities ranging from october 2006 to may 2032 and interest rates ranging from 500 to 875 on may 15 2005 100 million of 70 senior notes and 3 million of 665 senior notes matured and were repaid with cash on hand we have 300 million of 70 senior notes that mature in october 2006 that we currently expect to repay with available cash 

46   taxexempt bonds  — we actively issue taxexempt bonds as a means of accessing lowcost financing for capital expenditures as of december 31 2005 we had 23 billion of outstanding taxexempt bonds we issued 246 million of taxexempt bonds during 2005 the proceeds from these debt issuances were deposited directly into a trust fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services accordingly the restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not been included in “new borrowings” in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005 as we spend monies on the specific projects being financed we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds as discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above we have 185 million held in trust for future spending as of december 31 2005 during 2005 we received 404 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures 

  as of december 31 2005 615 million of our taxexempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us these bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our 24 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us accordingly these obligations have been classified as longterm in our december 31 2005 consolidated balance sheet 

  additionally we have 333 million of fixed rate taxexempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months which is prior to their scheduled maturities if the reoffering of the bonds is unsuccessful then the bonds can be put to us requiring immediate repayment these bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our longterm facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed reoffering and are therefore considered a current obligation however these bonds have been classified as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 the classification of these obligations as longterm was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other longterm financings in the event of a failed reoffering and our ability in the event other sources of longterm financing are not available to use our fiveyear revolving credit facility 

  taxexempt project bonds  — as of december 31 2005 we had 404 million of outstanding taxexempt project bonds these debt instruments are primarily used by our wheelabrator group to finance the development of wasteto energy facilities the bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments as of december 31 2005 46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our fiveyear revolving credit facility accordingly these obligations have been classified as longterm in our december 31 2005 consolidated balance sheet approximately 51 million of our taxexempt project bonds will be repaid with available cash within the next twelve months 

  convertible subordinated notes  — we had 35 million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid with cash on hand upon maturity on january 24 2005 

  interest rate swaps  — we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2005 the interest payments on 24 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates allowing us to maintain approximately 65 of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 35 at variable interest rates fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by 47 million as of december 31 2005 and 135 million at december 31 2004 

   the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions 

   net cash provided by operating activities  — we generated 2391 million in cash flows from our operating activities during the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 2218 million in 2004 an increase of 173 million in general our current year operating cash flow was favorably affected by growth in our operating income and comparative changes in our trade and other receivables as of december 31 2005 our trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful accounts have increased 40 million from december 31 2004 compared with a 223 million increase in trade receivables during 2004 the increase in our receivables in both periods was primarily related to increased revenues however the significant change yearoveryear can partially be attributed to 2004 receivable balances associated with significant revenues generated from hurricane related services provided in the second half of 2004 the relative change in our receivables can also be attributed to overall improvements in our collection efforts which have contributed to a reduction in our days sales outstanding 

  our 2005 and 2004 income taxes have been significantly affected by tax audit settlements the increases in our net income associated with these tax benefits resulted in offsetting reductions in our accrued liability balances therefore the significant variances in our income taxes during 2005 2004 and 2003 have had an insignificant impact on each respective period’s cash flows from operations 

  cash generated from operations during 2003 was negatively affected by a 223 million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit which was agreed to in 2001 this amount included i a final net cash settlement payment net of insurance proceeds of 377 million plus accrued interest ii a total tax benefit of approximately 138 million and iii related net settlement recoveries of approximately 16 million this net cash outflow was partially offset by 109 million of cash we received from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities after adjusting 2003 for the unusual items mentioned above our 2004 cash flows from operations increased 178 million over 2003 our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships were the primary contributors of this increase 

  net cash used in investing activities  — we used 1062 million of our cash resources for investing activities during 2005 an increase of 180 million as compared with 2004 this increase is primarily due to a 266 million change in net cash flows associated with purchases and sales of shortterm investments net purchases of shortterm investments during 2005 were 295 million compared with net purchases of 29 million during 2004 we increased our utilization of shortterm investments in the first quarter of 2004 which resulted in this activity being relatively insignificant in 2003 the increase in our shortterm investments available for use as of december 31 2005 can generally be attributed to an increase in our available cash which we plan to use to fund among other things a 275 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that became effective in january 2006 and our first quarter 2006 dividend that will be paid in march 2006 our share repurchases and dividends are discussed in our net cash used in financing activities section below 

  the current year increase in net cash outflows from investing activities as a result of our shortterm investments was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets which were 194 million in 2005 96 million in 2004 and 74 million in 2003 the 98 million increase from 2004 to 2005 is largely attributable to the sale of one of our landfills in ontario canada as required by a divestiture order from the canadian competition tribunal as we continue to focus on our plan to divest of 

48 certain underperforming and nonstrategic operations we expect proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales to make even greater contributions to our cash flows 

  our cash used for capital expenditures and acquisition spending has also caused significant changes in our net cash used for investing activities for the threeyear period due to the capitalintensive nature of our business we have invested between 12 billion and 13 billion in property and equipment during each of the last three years capital expenditures for 2005 were 1180 million which is 78 million and 20 million less than we invested in capital in 2004 and 2003 respectively cash used for acquisitions was 142 million in 2005 130 million in 2004 and 337 million in 2003 in recent years our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuckin acquisitions which are relatively small accretive businesses that will easily integrate with and provide value to our existing operations however our 2003 acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuckin acquisitions particularly in our recycling lineof business our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins 

  net cash used in financing activities  — the most significant changes in our financing cash flows during the three years ended december 31 2005 are related to i variances in our net debt repayments which can generally be attributed to scheduled maturities ii increases in our dividend payments and iii changes in cash paid for our repurchases of common stock cash paid for these financing activities are discussed below 

  net debt repayments were 11 million in 2005 386 million in 2004 and 456 million in 2003 the following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year 

   in august 2003 our board of directors approved our quarterly dividend program which began in the first quarter of 2004 under this program we declared and paid a dividend of 020 per share in each quarter of 2005 and of 01875 per share in each quarter of 2004 the payment of our quarterly dividends resulted in cash dividends of 449 million in 2005 and 432 million in 2004 before this program was implemented we paid an annual 001 per share dividend which resulted in a 6 million dividend payment in 2003 in october 2005 the board of directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be 022 per share on december 15 2005 the board declared our first quarterly dividend for 2006 of 022 per share which will be paid on march 24 2006 to stockholders of record as of march 6 2006 all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant 

  we paid 706 million for share repurchases in 2005 as compared with 496 million paid during 2004 and 550 million paid in 2003 our 2005 stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a board approved capital allocation program providing for the authorization of up to 12 billion for these activities 

49 during each of 2005 2006 and 2007 since the inception of our repurchase program in february 2002 we have repurchased approximately 102 million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately 27 billion we currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above and in january 2006 repurchased approximately 9 million shares for 275 million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the board in making dividend declarations 

summary of contractual obligations 

  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions 

  

 50   we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely as a result the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements our thirdparty guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2005 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 

seasonal trends and inflation 

  our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected however for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins certain weather conditions may actually result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months when electrical demand is generally lower to perform scheduled maintenance at our wasteto energy facilities 

  while inflationary increases in costs including the cost of fuel have affected our operating margins in recent periods we believe that inflation generally has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 

new accounting pronouncements 

  through december 31 2005 we accounted for equitybased compensation in accordance with apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended under apb no 25 companies were required to recognize compensation expense based on the “intrinsic value” of the award at the date of grant for stock options which were the primary form of awards we granted through december 31 2004 this meant that we recognized no compensation expense in connection with the grants as the exercise price of the options was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 share based payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense based on the “fair value” of share based payments on the date of grant we adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 which is discussed further in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

  in december 2005 the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive plans effective december 28 2005 the decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the noncash compensation expense that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a result of adopting sfas no 123r we estimate that the acceleration eliminated approximately 55 million of pretax compensation charges that would have been recognized over the next three years as the stock options continued to vest we recognized a 2 million pretax charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the acceleration but will not be required to recognize future compensation 

51 expense for the accelerated options under sfas no 123r unless further modifications are made to the options which is not anticipated 

  additionally as a result of the changes in accounting under sfas no 123r and a desire to design our longterm incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to operating and market performance our board of directors approved a substantial change in the form of awards that we grant beginning in 2005 annual stock options grants as well as stock option grants in connection with new hires and promotions were replaced with either i grants of restricted stock units and performance share units or ii an enhanced cash incentive compensation award the restricted stock units granted in 2005 vest over four years and the performance share units cliff vest based on the achievement of certain performance targets after a threeyear performance period using apb no 25 we generally have recognized compensation expense for these awards over their respective vesting periods compensation expense included in reported net income associated with restricted stock shares of which were granted to a limited number of employees in each of the last three years restricted stock units and performance share units was 17 million or 11 million net of tax for the year ended december 31 2005 the amount of compensation expense recognized would not have been significantly different had we accounted for them under the provisions of sfas no 123r 

  as a result of our board of directors’ decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding options and replace stock options with restricted stock units and performance share units we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 123r to significantly affect our accounting for equitybased compensation since the resulting compensation expense for our new share based payment awards is not significantly different than under apb no 25 however we do expect compensation expense to increase over the next three to four years because of the incremental expense that will be recognized each year as our board of directors grants additional awards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2005 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider creditworthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 

  we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 

  interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are primarily denominated in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations which directly impacts variability in interest costs an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately 480 million at december 31 2005 and 490 million at december 31 2004 this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 

  we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have 460 million and 647 million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of longterm “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure postclosure and remedial activities at our disposal 

52 facilities and are therefore invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities because of the short terms to maturity of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 

  currency rate exposure from time to time we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt transactions at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding 

  commodities price exposure we market recycled products such as wastepaper aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities we enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales under the swap agreements we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time with regard to our option agreements we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors put options and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings call options additionally we have entered into collars combination of a put and call option with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling we record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings as required all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used the fair value position of our commodity derivatives would decrease by approximately 10 million at december 31 2005 and by approximately 20 million at december 31 2004 if there were an instantaneous 10 increase across all commodities and applicable yield curves

 item 1 business tableend general   the financial statements in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation its majorityowned subsidiaries and entities required to be consolidated pursuant to the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” waste management inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” refer to waste management inc and its consolidated subsidiaries when we use the term “wmi” we are referring only to the parent holding company   we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america through our subsidiaries we provide collection transfer recycling and resource recovery and disposal services we are also a leading developer operator and owner of wastetoenergy facilities in the united states our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities during 2004 none of our customers accounted for more than 1 of our operating revenue we employed approximately 51000 people as of december 31 2004   our parent company was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger waste management inc an oakbrook illinois based waste services company became a 100 owned subsidiary and changed its name to waste management holdings inc at the same time our parent company changed its name to waste management inc our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street suite 4000 houston texas 77002 our telephone number at that address is 713 5126200 our website address is httpwwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wmi” strategy   under varying economic conditions we must achieve operational excellence in order to be successful for our stockholders due to challenging economic conditions in recent years our principal operational focus was on reducing our cost structure now that we have seen economic conditions improve we are focusing our operations on a combination of growth productivity improvements and continued cost cutting our plan for growth will be grounded in margin expansion from better pricing while continuing to cut costs and we will apply a disciplined approach to growing our returns from new capital investments   we will pursue operational excellence by focusing on what we are doing well particularly by focusing on the areas of safety maintenance and productivity we are committed to finding the best practices throughout our organization and standardizing those practices and processes throughout the company we recently announced a landfill pricing study at 30 of our landfills where we will gather and analyze information to assist us in understanding the reactions to our price increases in various markets in the united states and canada additionally we are continuing to put in place information systems that will provide our people with the necessary resources to make better decisions to determine which practices work and which do not we rely heavily on our people in the field we are also giving local management more latitude to apply our best practices in their specific circumstances finally we believe that we can achieve operational excellence by continuing to focus on our core business and related services our goal is to be best in class and we have initiated several programs and efforts to ensure that we provide the highest level of service to our customers   we are sustained by our strategic assets we have a large north american presence including 286 landfills that we own or operate which we intend to use to distinguish our company from our competition we plan to continue to do that through such programs as our national accounts our national presence and 1   our experience allow us to provide large multilocation commercial and industrial customers with a single point of contact for nationwide services at competitive pricing additionally we intend to grow our inplant services model where we use our skills and resources to manage customers’ waste needs by having our employees work onsite to reduce waste increase recycling and lower overall costs of disposal and to provide innovative waste service solutions 

  we also intend to continue to use the cash that we generate to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures using a disciplined process to make investments in those locations and lines of business that offer superior margins and return on capital we will continue our tuckin acquisition program primarily seeking collection operations that overlay our existing route structure and are strategically located near our existing disposal sites permitted landfills transfer stations or wastetoenergy facilities are also attractive acquisition candidates at the same time we are reviewing our under performing operations and assessing them for opportunities to improve their performance we expect that there may be no easy solutions for certain of these underperforming operations and we may elect to seek exit strategies which may include exiting lines of businesses not renewing or bidding on certain contracts or offering certain assets for sale to others   we have developed goals for our company for 2005 and beyond that are designed to help us achieve operational excellence these goals were developed around the concept of providing service to fostering relationships with or otherwise benefiting five key stakeholders    by focusing on these key stakeholders we believe we can achieve our goal of operational excellence we have developed the following goals objectives and initiatives around our stakeholders  2    operations 

 

   we manage and evaluate our operations through seven operating groups five of which are organized by geographic area and the other two of which are organized by function the geographic groups include our eastern midwest southern western and canadian groups and our two functional groups are the recycling and wheelabrator groups these seven operating groups represent our reportable segments   these reportable segments when combined with certain other operations not managed through any of the seven groups comprise our north american solid waste or “nasw” operations nasw our core business provides integrated waste management services consisting of collection disposal solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants that are managed by wheelabrator recycling and other services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers throughout the united states puerto rico and canada the operations not managed through our seven groups which include thirdparty subcontracted services managed by our national accounts organization methane gas recovery rentals and other miscellaneous services are presented in this report as “other nasw”   the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the 2003 and 2002 information has been presented in conformity with our current year presentation more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report  

 

   the services provided by our nasw segments include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wheelabrator wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants 3   recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated 

   collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to a transfer station or disposal site we generally provide collection services under two types of arrangements    landfill landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in north america and we have the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are built and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are operated under prescribed procedures a landfill must be maintained to meet federal state or provincial and local regulations the operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes   all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill we believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate a practice we refer to as internalization rather than using third party disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on several factors including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited   we also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under federal environmental laws the federal government or states with delegated authority must permit all hazardous waste landfills all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous 4   waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform wastes into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous wastes in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial geological confining layers 

  we owned or operated 281 solid waste and five hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2004 compared with 284 solid waste landfills and five hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2003 the landfills that we operate but do not own are generally operated under a lease agreement or an operating contract the differences between the two arrangements usually relate to the owner of the landfill operating permit generally with a lease agreement the permit is in our name and we operate the landfill for its entire life making payments to the lessor who is generally a private landowner based either on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received we are generally responsible for closure and postclosure requirements under our lease agreements for operating contracts the owner of the property generally a municipality usually owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term which may be the life of the landfill the property owner is generally responsible for closure and postclosure obligations under our operating contracts   based on remaining permitted capacity as of december 31 2004 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 27 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit we are currently seeking expansion permits at 73 of our landfills for which we consider expansions to be likely although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 36 years when considering remaining permitted capacity the expansion capacity we consider likely and projected annual disposal volume at december 31 2004 and 2003 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions  5     the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 in millions     the number of landfills we own or operate segregated by their estimated operating lives in years based on remaining permitted and probable expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume as of december 31 2004 were as follows    the volume of waste as measured in tons that we received in 2004 and 2003 at all of our landfills is shown below tons in thousands

   when a landfill we own or operate i reaches its permitted waste capacity ii is permanently capped and iii receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency management of the site including any remediation activities is generally transferred to our closed sites management group at december 31 2004 we managed 174 closed landfills   transfer at december 31 2004 we owned or operated 381 transfer stations in north america we deposit waste at these stations as do other thirdparty waste haulers at these stations the solid waste is consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste the waste is then transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites   access to transfer stations is often critical to third party haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in close proximity to their collection operations fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred the distance to the disposal site and general market factors   the utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect it allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because i transfer trucks railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip ii waste is compacted at transfer stations which increases the efficiency of our collection personnel and equipment because they are able to focus on collection activities rather than making trips to disposal sites and iii we can maintain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our disposal sites   the transfer stations that we operate but do not own are generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for all of the regulatory requirements in accordance with the lease and operating agreements terms   wheelabrator through wheelabrator we own or operate 17 wastetoenergy facilities that are located in 11 states in the northeast florida california and washington our wastetoenergy facilities are capable of processing up to 24200 tons of solid waste each day in 2004 our wastetoenergy facilities received approximately 78 million total tons or approximately 21300 tons per day compared to approximately 77 million total tons or approximately 21200 tons per day in 2003 the solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers at these facilities producing heat that is converted into highpressure steam we use that steam to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities under longterm contracts   our wheelabrator operations also include six independent power production plants that convert various waste and conventional fuels into electricity and steam the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining in addition to electricity production the plants also produce steam which is sold to industrial and commercial users   fees at our wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants are influenced by the market rates for electricity and steam type and volume of waste received and other general market factors   recycling our recycling group is comprised of recycle america alliance llc “raa” raa was formed in january 2003 to improve the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs and includes certain recycling assets transferred from our geographic operating groups as well as assets acquired from the peltz group who maintained approximately nine percent of the equity interest in raa as of 7   december 31 2004 in addition to our recycling group our five geographic operating groups provide certain recycling services that are embedded within the groups’ other operations and therefore were not transferred to raa 

  recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following    recycling fees are influenced by frequency of collection type and volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors   our recycling group purchases recyclable materials processed in our mrfs from various sources including third parties and other operating subsidiaries of wmi the cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the product to our customers the price our recycling group pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate” and is based upon the price we receive for sales of finished goods and local market conditions as a result higher commodity prices increase our revenues and increase the rebates we pay to our suppliers   other nasw we provide inplant services in which we outsource our employees to provide full service waste management to customers at their plants our vertically integrated waste management operations allow us to provide these customers with full management of their waste including identifying recycling opportunities minimizing their waste determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and transporting and disposing of their waste   we also develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program the natural breakdown of waste deposited in a landfill produces landfill gas the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel for a number of industrial and commercial applications we actively pursue landfill gas beneficial use projects and at december 31 2004 we were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 90 of our solid waste landfills for 57 of these landfills the processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 29 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a 8   direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes such as steam boilers cement kilns and utility plants at four landfills the landfill gas is processed to pipelinequality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers 

  in addition as part of our other nasw operations we rent and service portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet® and provide street and parking lot sweeping services competition   the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies private solid waste companies large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private wastetoenergy companies we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills the municipalities and regional governmental authorities can subsidize the cost of service through the use of tax revenues and taxexempt financing and therefore have a competitive advantage   operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition based on quality of service and pricing under certain customer service contracts our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers may be limited from time to time competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts employees   at december 31 2004 we had approximately 51000 fulltime employees of which approximately 7900 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 14500 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that we negotiate with unions financial assurance and insurance obligations 

 

   financial assurance is generally required in municipal and governmental waste service contracts it is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits municipal and governmental waste management contracts typically require performance bonds or bank letters of credit to secure performance we are also required to provide various forms of financial assurance for estimated closure postclosure and remedial obligations at our landfills   we establish financial assurance in different ways depending on the jurisdiction including escrow accounts funded by revenues during the operational life of a facility letters of credit surety bonds trust agreements and insurance although the supply of surety bonds has become increasingly limited in recent years we have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the financial assurance instruments 9   required for our current operations the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2004 

 

 

   the assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the closure postclosure and remedial obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established other than these 10   permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

 

   we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy our general liability workers’ compensation and auto insurance programs have per incident deductibles of 25 million 1 million and 20000 respectively except as discussed in notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows regulation   our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the environmental protection agency “epa” and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations   because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain necessary required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain necessary governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage   the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below  11      there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are more strict than comparable federal laws and regulations additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling   various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance was unconstitutional however other courts have refused to apply the supreme court precedent in various circumstances in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste these congressional efforts have to date been unsuccessful the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level or the courts’ interpretation or validation of flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid waste management services   many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or 12   permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

  see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of regulations on our current and future operations factors influencing future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements   when we make statements containing projections about our accounting and finances plans and objectives for the future future economic performance or when we make statements containing any other projections or estimates about our assumptions relating to these types of statements we are making forwardlooking statements these statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results we make these statements in an effort to keep stockholders and the public informed about our business and have based them on our current expectations about future events you should view such statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we do not control any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events or developments the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements   outlined below are some of the risks that we face and that could affect our business and financial position for 2005 and beyond however they are not the only risks that we face there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position    we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists of large national waste management companies and local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues and taxexempt financing are available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage   in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts when this happens we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or retain our customers resulting in a negative impact to our yield on base business    in recent years we have implemented several profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our revenues and continue to seek ways to reduce our selling general and administrative and operating expenses while we have generally been successful in reducing our selling general and administrative costs managing subcontractor costs and managing the effect of fuel price increases these initiatives may not be sufficient even as our revenues increase if we are unable to control variable costs or increases to our fixed costs in the future we will be unable to maintain or expand our margins in recent periods rising employeerelated costs and expenses including health care and other employee benefits such as unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation have negatively impacted our measures to reduce costs 13      our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the summer such as the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of 2004 actually increase our revenues in the areas affected although for several reasons including the increased use of subcontractors such revenues tend to be low margin conversely harsh winter weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of those periods the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities   additionally our business is affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are also outside of our control including interest rates and consumer confidence we have approximately 32 billion of debt as december 31 2004 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the combined impact of our variable rate taxexempt bonds and our interest rate swap agreements therefore any increase in interest rates can significantly increase our expenses additionally although our services are of an essential nature a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which decreases our revenues we also face risks related to other adverse external factors such as the ability of our insurers to meet their commitments timely and the effect that significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may have on such ability   any of the factors described above could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally due to these and other factors operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period    we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of drinking water sources or soil under current law we could even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows   in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past and may in the future become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which    we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised if we are not successful the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our costs or liabilities 14      stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as    regulations also affect the siting design and closure of landfills and could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial   in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit operations    the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other events outside our control such as actions by opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns and environmental concerns in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have ranged from an increase of 41 to a decrease of 2 we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations and price escalations or reductions in the supply will likely increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on income from operations and cash flows we have in place a fuel surcharge program designed to offset increased fuel expenses however we are not able to pass through all of the increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs additionally as fuel prices increase many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs we may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising costs of fuel    the amount of insurance required to be maintained for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels we face the risk of incurring liabilities for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss thereby allowing us to manage our selfinsurance exposure associated with claims to the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results   in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to environmental closure and postclosure liabilities we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds rely on insurance including captive insurance or fund trust and escrow accounts we currently have in place all necessary financial assurance 15   instruments we do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future we are aware of recent increases in the cost of surety bonds however in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance these types of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain which could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects acquisitions software development costs and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired a pending acquisition is not completed a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility acquisition or project we reduce the charge against earnings by any portion of the capitalized expenditures and advances that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise   in future periods we may be required to incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or due to other events that cause impairments depending on the magnitude any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations    our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers including old corrugated cardboard “occ” and old newsprint “onp” we enter into commodity price derivatives in an effort to mitigate some of the variability in cash flows from the sales of recyclable materials at floating prices in the past three years the yearoveryear changes in the quarterly average market prices for occ ranged from a decrease of as much as 37 to an increase of as much as 131 the same comparisons for onp have ranged from a decrease of as much as 20 to an increase of as much as 64 these fluctuations can affect future operating income and cash flows additionally our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers based on the market prices of commodities we purchase therefore even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities the rebates we pay will also increase   additionally there may be significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energy related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations the marketing and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and wastetoenergy operations are generally pursuant to longterm sales agreements therefore market fluctuations do not have a significant effect on these operations in the shortterm however revenues from our independent power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly electricity prices have ranged from increases of as much as 7 to decreases of as much as 4    our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting in addition some state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard wastes at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities although such mandates are a useful tool to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to 16   operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services 

   labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements work stoppages including strikes could ensue depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions our operating expenses could increase significantly which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows    we are currently involved in civil litigation and governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these matters is uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity    we currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures acquisitions and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary additional financings however our board of directors has approved a new capital allocation program that provides for up to 12 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during 2005 2006 and 2007 materially adverse events could reduce our cash flows from operations in such an event we could be forced to reduce capital expenditures acquisition activity share repurchase activity or dividend declarations in these circumstances we may elect to incur more indebtedness if we made such an election there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable terms in these circumstances we would likely use our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs   our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants in the event our interest expense is more than expected due to higher interest rates or our ratio of debt to earnings as per the credit facility terms is more than expected we may not be in compliance with the covenants this would result in a default under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain waivers or amendments to the credit facility the lenders could choose to declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable which we may not be able to pay in full default under our credit agreements or unavailability of this capital source could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our borrowing and financial assurance needs    we may experience problems with our information technology systems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved these problems could be with respect to the operation of our current systems or the implementation of new systems additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable law and regulations 17      our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results in future periods

   this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december 31 2004 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1 of this report under the section “factors influencing future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements” the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   we had some positive experiences in 2004 but also some challenges volumes were generally strong throughout 2004 providing the most significant volumerelated revenue growth we had seen in a few years while generating revenue growth from pricing remained difficult we experienced a positive change in yield on base business in 2004 we had reasonable success with price increases to existing customers in our collection line of business in most markets however we continue to experience increased pricing competition in our collection operations characterized by offers from competitors to our customers to provide the same services at much lower prices than we are charging and by lower average rates being offered by the competition on new business bids this was especially prevalent in the midwest group additionally we experienced declines in yield from 2003 to 2004 for our landfill operations due largely to competitive pricing on special waste although those declines were partially offset by increased municipal solid waste pricing   although we saw an economic recovery in 2004 that brought with it increased volumes we did not experience significantly increased pricing we previously implemented a pricing model for our collection operations and recently announced a landfill pricing study pursuant to this study we chose 30 landfills at which we will be increasing pricing on municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste the objective is to gather and analyze information to help us better understand the reactions to the increases which will help us to manage our pricing in the future   we also had continued success in implementing our operational excellence initiatives during 2004 in the area of safety we launched mission to zero in late 2000 with the objective of promoting zero tolerance for unsafe actions conditions and attitudes across the organization our goal is to attain worldclass safety for the protection of our employees customers and communities we continue to see improvements in both our total recordable incident rate and hourly accident recordable rate which are the metrics we use to measure our success in attaining this goal we also continued to make progress in 2004 in the area of fleet maintenance and route optimization the metric we use for our fleet maintenance is maintenance cost per driver hour which we try to improve through basic planning and scheduling of maintenance work as well as enhanced training for our route optimization initiative we use a proprietary software application called wasteroute designed to help us organize our routes more efficiently we believe the optimization initiative has resulted in improved productivity as we continue to reduce the number of routes our plans going forward are to institutionalize the best practices we have identified to support our future productivity improvement   in 2004 we experienced increases in operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses as compared with the prior year however these costs as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat which we believe demonstrates the effectiveness of our cost reduction programs in these areas we experienced the increases in operating expenses that are expected as a result of increased revenues the biggest drivers increasing costs of operations were increased subcontractor costs as a result of higher volumes some of which came from the hurricane clean up work higher costs of goods sold fuel costs and an increase in the cost of steel our costs of goods sold include rebates made by the recycling group to suppliers and are based on market prices of recyclable commodities fuel costs also increased during the year although a significant portion of those costs were offset through our fuel surcharges to customers the increase in dollars spent in 2004 on selling general and administrative costs related to increased salaries and wages and increased commissions and bonuses which are a result of the overall improvement in our operating results additionally we experienced increased professional fees as a result of our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and increased litigation defense and indemnification costs related to legal matters 23     we believe that the production of free cash flow is a very important measure of our liquidity and operating results as it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase stock and execute our acquisition program free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and is not intended to replace the consolidated statement of cash flows that was prepared in accordance with gaap we generated approximately 106 billion in free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2004 free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities and adding to that the proceeds from divestitures net of cash divested and other sales of assets as shown in the following table in millions    we are projecting fullyear 2005 free cash flow to be in the range of 11 billion to 12 billion based on estimated net cash provided by operating activities being in the range of 225 billion to 235 billion capital expenditures between 125 billion and 135 billion and proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets of 125 million to 150 million 

 

   as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following reclassifications have been made in our prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation  24      additionally certain other minor reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financials statements in order to conform to the current year presentation the financial information included herein has been updated to reflect these changes 

 

   in preparing our financial statements we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets liabilities stockholders’ equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments as described below   landfills  — effective january 1 2003 our method of accounting for landfill closure and postclosure as well as landfill final capping changed as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  through december 31 2002 the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and postclosure obligations on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill this practice referred to as lifecycle accounting within the waste industry continues to be followed with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs as a result of the adoption of sfas no 143 future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 143   the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 143 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations   landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and 25   landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs are dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

  final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events they then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often as significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset however as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense   closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain   available airspace — our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity   expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely using the following criteria    these criteria are initially evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits however our policy provides that based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill if these criteria are not met inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed in these circumstances inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of 26   directors on a quarterly basis of the 73 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2004 19 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace approximately threefourths of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because legal community or other issues could impede the expansion process while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements which in many cases were due to statespecific permitting procedures when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

  after determining the costs at our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed we look at factors such as the waste stream geography and rate of compaction among others to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change   it is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner the costs of the landfill including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion may be subject to impairment testing as described below lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher closure and postclosure rates and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace additionally if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately   environmental remediation liabilities  — under current laws and regulations we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business these costs include potentially responsible party “prp” investigation settlement certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site next we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on    asset impairments  — our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization however accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets rather than a 27   single asset if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an actual thirdparty valuation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 

  typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include    if any of these or other indicators occur we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment several of these indicators are beyond our control and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur additionally estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below   landfills  — certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry   goodwill  — at least annually we assess whether goodwill is impaired upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances such as those listed above that would indicate that more likely than not the book value of goodwill has been impaired 28   results of operations   the following table presents for the periods indicated the periodtoperiod change in dollars in millions and percentages for the respective statement of operations line items   29     the following table presents for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that the respective statement of operations line items has to operating revenues  

 

   our operating revenues in 2004 were 125 billion compared to 116 billion in 2003 and 112 billion in 2002 as shown below north american solid waste or “nasw” is our principal operation and is comprised of seven operating groups within north america along with our other nasw services the operations shown as “nonnasw divested operations” in the table below consisted of our nonsolid waste services which were divested as of march 31 2002  30     our nasw operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties generally based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semimonthly fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site and are normally billed monthly recycling revenue which is generated by our recycling group as well as our five geographic operating groups generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements   the mix of nasw operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions    the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in nasw revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes    base business  — base business yield improvements contributed to increased revenues in our collection transfer and wastetoenergy operations in 2004 as compared with 2003 in our collection business the most substantial yield improvements during 2004 were in our industrial and residential operations where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout 2004 has been positive it was affected by increased price competition particularly in the midwest and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the south the base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout 2004 31   have been almost exclusively attributable to the eastern portion of the united states however increased pricing in our transfer business in the east has negatively affected our volumerelated revenue in that region the base business yield increases during 2004 have been partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations this decline is primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste particularly in the south and midwest which has been partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal 

  in 2003 the increase in base business yield as compared to 2002 was attributable to our collection transfer and wastetoenergy businesses with a significant increase in our residential collection operations certain of these price increases related to additional costs and taxes were passed on to our customers however the increase was partially offset by our landfill business where we experienced decreases in pricerelated revenue principally due to our special waste landfill operations mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the southern and western portions of the united states   commodity  — our revenues in both 2004 and 2003 were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process average prices for old corrugated cardboard were up approximately 33 during the year from 64 per ton in 2003 to 85 per ton in 2004 average prices for old newsprint have also improved yearoveryear by approximately 25 from 69 per ton in 2003 to 86 per ton in 2004 however a significant portion of increases from commodity prices is rebated to our suppliers thereby increasing our cost of goods sold resulting in a relatively small impact to our income from operations   fuel surcharges and fees  — we experienced revenue improvements during 2004 due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by approximately 53 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and approximately 33 million for the year ended december 31 2003 these increases were more than offset by increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices as discussed in operating expenses — fuel    volume  — during 2004 we experienced significant volumerelated revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses driven principally by our southern and western groups a substantial portion of volumerelated revenue growth is due to the volume increases each of our operating groups has experienced in its industrial collection operations in the southern and western portions of the united states our residential collection and transfer volumes have also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout the year additionally hurricane cleanup efforts increased the southern group’s 2004 volumerelated revenues by approximately 115 million landfill volume increases have also provided significant revenue improvements during 2004 the volume increases in our landfill business have been the most significant in the south and west where increases in both construction and demolition waste and special waste have been substantial excluding the impact of hurricanes we believe that a relatively strong economic environment has driven our volumerelated revenue improvements   our revenue due to volumes decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily in our collection and recycling businesses we believe the 2003 declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition particularly in the eastern and midwestern portions of the united states our loss of a contract with the city of chicago during february 2003 was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling accounting for lost revenues of approximately 60 million for the year ended december 31 2003 partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills primarily in the southern and western portions of the united states   acquisitions  — in 2004 the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from allied waste industries inc in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 other acquisitions of recycling transfer and wastetoenergy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of 2003 also provided increases in revenues during 2004 in 2003 we also acquired the peltz group the largest privatelyheld recycler in the united states 32   

 

   our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits which include salaries and wages related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to both equipment and facilities iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities v costs of goods sold which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oils to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes host community fees and royalties and viii other operating costs which include equipment and facility rent property taxes insurance and claims costs and landfill operating costs   the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions    when comparing the year ended december 31 2002 to other periods our 2002 restructuring as discussed below within restructuring  resulted in the recharacterization of certain labor and facilityrelated costs through march 31 2002 these costs were included within other selling general and administrative costs after the adoption of the new organizational structure these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since april 1 2002 when the organizational changes became effective the components of operating expenses impacted are labor and related benefits as well as other operating expenses   labor and related benefits  — after excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling general and administrative costs as discussed above these costs have increased yearover year as a result of i higher salaries and hourly wages when compared with the prior year due to annual merit increases ii increased overtime costs due in part to increased volumes and iii salary and hourly wage costs related to acquisitions additionally the increases in 2004 and to a lesser extent in 2003 have been partially offset by savings realized as a result of our 2003 workforce reductions   transfer and disposal costs  — the increases are due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions   subcontractor costs  — these cost increases during 2004 as compared with the prior year are primarily due to higher volumes we have experienced throughout the year including increased subcontractor costs of approximately 78 million in 2004 attributable to hurricane cleanup services provided by our southern group also contributing to the increases are i the impact of acquisitions ii increased thirdparty transportation costs in our western group due to the service requirements of certain event work iii higher fuel surcharges paid to third party subcontractors and iv additional transportation costs in our eastern group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills 33     in 2003 we also experienced to a lesser extent the effects of the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints in the eastern group additionally we had increased subcontractor costs in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to i increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business ii general volume increases and iii increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services   cost of goods sold  — our recycling group provides our suppliers with rebates that are driven by market prices of recyclable commodities which means that the increase in cost of goods sold correlates directly to the increase in the market prices of these commodities and our revenue yield   fuel  — we experienced an average increase of 030 per gallon for 2004 as compared with 2003 and in 2003 we experienced an average increase of 019 per gallon over 2002 however a significant portion of this cost increase is offset by our fuel surcharges to customers which are reflected as fuel price increases within our operating revenues section above   other operating expenses  — the primary reason for the decrease during 2004 as compared with 2003 is the impact of the december 31 2003 consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities from which we lease three wastetoenergy facilities prior to the consolidation of these entities we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases the consolidation of these entities has therefore resulted in a decline in rental expense in 2004 which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation interest expense and minority interest expense additionally in 2004 we experienced increased landfill and environmental costs but had partially offsetting gains from the sale of certain assets   after excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling general and administrative costs as discussed above the increase in 2003 other operating expenses over 2002 is partially attributable to i increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately 24 million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of sfas no 143 and ii increased risk management expenses of approximately 20 million largely as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs 

 

   our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs which include salaries related insurance and benefits contract labor and payroll taxes ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other general and administrative expenses which include facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunications advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing   the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions    labor and related benefits  — we realized an increase in labor and related benefits for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with the prior year primarily attributable to i increased commissions paid to our sales personnel ii higher salaries and hourly wages that were partially offset by the 2003 workforce reduction and iii higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance for 2004 a decline in our use of contract labor has partially offset these increases 34     during the year ended december 31 2003 the overall reduction in labor and related benefits was a result of reductions in salary and other laborrelated costs which were primarily derived from our march 2002 reorganization and february and june 2003 restructurings   professional fees  — we experienced increases in professional fees for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with the year ended december 31 2003 as a result of higher litigation and defense costs and consulting fees for both general business reasons and our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we did not see a significant fluctuation in professional fees between the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002   other selling general and administrative costs  — during 2003 we obtained favorable settlements for legal disputes which are driving the apparent increase in costs in 2004 as compared with 2003 after excluding this impact we have maintained our cost reduction efforts that were put in place in 2003 in 2003 management focused on reducing spending related to travel and entertainment and other administrative costs   this focus on cost reduction is a primary factor for the lower other selling general and administrative costs for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared with 2002 additionally in 2002 we experienced increases in our legal reserves that resulted in an unfavorable effect on results as compared with 2003   also when comparing the year ended december 31 2002 to other periods our 2002 restructuring as discussed below within restructuring resulted in the recharacterization of certain labor and facilityrelated costs through march 31 2002 these costs were included within other selling general and administrative costs after the adoption of the new organizational structure these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since april 1 2002 which is when the organizational changes became effective 

 

   depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset ii depreciation of property and equipment on a straightline basis from three to 50 years iii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site and iv amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event   the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily related to i an increase in our landfill amortization rate net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs of 019 per ton and to a lesser extent an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes ii increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprisewide software systems into service during the latter half of 2003 and iii increased depreciation expense for our wheelabrator group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities the increase in our landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization in 2004 was partially offset by the impact of approximately 18 million of incremental changes related to our final capping closure and post closure obligations due to i the addition of new landfill expansions and the removal of certain expansions from the landfill cost base ii permit modifications iii the settlement of final capping events and iv changes in certain estimates that are derived from an annual review which occurs in the fourth quarter of each year depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003 

 

   in 2002 we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic groups to better align collection transport recycling and disposal resources as part of the restructuring we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately 1900 fieldlevel administrative and operational 35   positions in 2002 we recorded 38 million in pretax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure these charges included 36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and 2 million related to abandoned operating lease agreements all payments related to this restructuring have been made 

  in february 2003 we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization as a result we incurred approximately 20 million in onetime employee severance and benefit costs the operational efficiencies provided by the february 2003 organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in june 2003 we recorded 24 million of pretax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during 2003   during 2004 we recorded a 1 million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with these workforce reductions as of december 31 2004 substantially all obligations associated with the february restructuring and workforce reduction have been paid the first quarter of 2005 is the final period we are obligated to make any severance payments to employees associated with the february 2003 reorganization and workforce reduction approximately 1 million remains accrued as of december 31 2004 for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of the june 2003 workforce reduction which will be paid to certain employees through the third quarter of 2005 

 

   in 2004 the net gain of 13 million for asset impairments and unusual items related to i 17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs ii 15 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain portolet operations and iii 15 million of gains in 2004 related to adjustments we made to our estimated obligations associated with our nonnasw divested operations and our receipt of cash from a thirdparty for a previously settled remedial obligation   during 2003 we recorded a net gain of 8 million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of 13 million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset in part by 5 million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges   in 2002 the net gain of 34 million for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to i our receipt of approximately 11 million related to a previously impaired nonrevenue producing asset ii net gains of approximately 8 million on divestitures during the year and iii reductions to legal reserves of approximately 8 million and loss contract reserves of approximately 7 million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items 

 

   we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western canadian wheelabrator and recycling groups these groups when combined with certain other operations comprise our nasw operations the operations not managed through our seven operating groups are presented herein as “other nasw”   as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements charges associated with our restructuring and workforce reductions impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in 2003 and 2002 the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended december 31 36   for each respective period and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments’ operating results in millions 

   canadian  — while general economic factors such as foreign currency rates favorably affected operating results yearoveryear a favorable legal settlement of 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an unfavorable legal settlement of 26 million in 2002 were the primary drivers of these changes   eastern  — operating income improvement from 2003 to 2004 was driven primarily by i revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business partially offset by volume declines in transfer residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year ii higher operating expenses incurred in 2003 due to the first quarter’s harsh weather conditions and iii acquisitions these earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill the most significant factors affecting the decline from 2002 to 2003 were i lower collection and landfill volumes ii increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the united states iii general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs and iv harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2003   midwest  — lower operating income in 2003 as compared with 2002 was primarily due to i the harsh winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2003 ii soft economic conditions leading to lower volume and iii an increase in competitive activity leading to price rollbacks and lost business these economic and competitive pressures continued to impact the midwest’s results during 2004   southern  — operating income in 2004 has been favorably affected by i positive internal revenue growth largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations ii acquisitions iii increased revenue during the second half of 2004 as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter iv favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2004 largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout 2004 and v various operating and administrative cost reductions these improvements were partially offset by the writeoff of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of 2004 results for the southern group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003   western  — the 2004 increase is primarily attributable to revenue growth which is largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations these gains were partially offset by i increased labor costs ii higher fuel costs not passed on to customers and iii increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs results for the western group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003   wheelabrator  — the increase in 2004 operating income was due in large part to i positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on longterm disposal contracts and ii the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december 31 2003 which has increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs partially offset by 37   increases in depreciation expense the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense wheelabrator’s 2003 operating results were favorably affected by an 11 million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented 

  recycling  — the recycling group’s 2004 operating revenues have been favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for recycling commodities improvements in the market prices for these commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers these favorable market conditions were the primary drivers of the current year’s increase in earnings 

 

   the following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions   

 

   in 2004 net interest expense decreased approximately 42 million when compared with 2003 which is due to a 58 million increase in interest income from 12 million in 2003 to 70 million in 2004 this increase is due primarily to interest income of 46 million realized on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits partially offsetting the benefit of the current year increase in interest income is a 16 million increase in interest expense which is primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december 31 2003 as a result of our implementation of fin 46   the decline in net interest expense in 2003 when compared with 2002 can be largely attributed to our increased utilization of taxexempt financing which contributed to a decline in our weighted average interest rate for the period   for all periods we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates the combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in interest expense reductions of approximately 90 million for 2004 approximately 96 million for 2003 and approximately 86 million for 2002 while we expect the benefits of our interest rate derivative contracts to continue in 2005 the benefit derived from our interest rate contracts will be impacted by changes in shortterm rates on our active agreements and will decline as the debt associated with terminated contracts matures   of the 90 million in reductions to interest expense realized in 2004 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements 48 million related to the amortization of terminated swaps our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by 42 million in 2005 41 million in 2006 and 37 million in 2007 

 

   in the first and second quarters of 2004 we acquired an equity interest in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities we account for our investments in these entities using the equity method of accounting 38   and their related losses are the reason for the 2004 versus 2003 change in equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities these equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for income taxes if for any reason the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under section 29 of the internal revenue code we would no longer incur these equity losses additional information related to these investments is included in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   the increase in 2004 minority interest expense over prior years was primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities on december 31 2003 as a result of our implementation of fin 46 this increase was more than offset by an increase in our income from operations as a result of consolidating the entities additional information related to these investments is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   our other income and expense in 2003 and 2004 is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation   we experienced a significant impact to other income in 2002 due primarily to the sale of an equity investment in 2002 a company in which we held an approximately 17 interest was acquired by another entity we also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition the proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 

 

   we recorded a provision for income taxes of 247 million for 2004 404 million for 2003 and 422 million for 2002 resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 210 360 and 340 for each of the three years respectively   the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2004 is primarily due to i the realization of nonconventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills and our investments in the coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities discussed above within equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities and ii the realization of a net benefit of approximately 101 million for tax audit settlements that occurred during the year offset in part by iii state and local income taxes the decrease of approximately 131 million in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in the coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities discussed above   the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes offset in part by nonconventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills additionally in 2003 we recognized a 6 million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits in 2002 we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture a tax benefit of approximately 31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carryback of losses by our dutch subsidiary   see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

   on march 31 2004 we recorded a credit of approximately 8 million net of taxes or 001 per diluted share as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by fin 46 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 39     in the first and fourth quarters of 2003 we recorded net of tax charges of 46 million and 43 million respectively to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below    in the first quarter of 2002 we recorded a credit of 2 million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 141 accounting for business combinations liquidity and capital resources 

 

   as an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations however we operate in a capitalintensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength in the past we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future these factors include    we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet iii refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations and v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills beginning in 2002 we committed ourselves to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment 40   through our share repurchase program and in 2004 began a quarterly dividend program our board of directors has approved a new capital allocation program that provides for up to 12 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during 2005 2006 and 2007 we also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business 

  on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” became law a provision of the act temporarily reduces the tax rate on repatriated income if the income is permanently reinvested in the us we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this legislation which includes an analysis of the funds provided by our canadian operations available for repatriation however we do not expect this legislation to materially impact our consolidated liquidity position 

 

   the following is a summary of our cash restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 in millions    cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less   restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trusts and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations funds deposited in connection with landfill closure postclosure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits these balances are primarily included within longterm other assets in our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion   debt  — revolving credit and letter of credit facilities — the table below summarizes the credit capacity maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and principal letter of credit facilities outstanding at december 31 2004 in millions we also had an additional 88 million in 41   outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2004 that have been issued under various arrangements none of which provide for committed capacity 

 

 

   we have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs certain taxexempt bond issuances municipal and governmental waste management contracts closure and postclosure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits these facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit we expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs   on october 15 2004 we renegotiated our threeyear 650 million and fiveyear 175 billion revolving credit facilities replacing them with a single fiveyear 24 billion syndicated revolving credit facility   senior notes  — during march 2004 we issued 350 million of 50 senior notes due march 15 2014 the net proceeds of the offering were approximately 346 million after deducting underwriters’ discounts and expenses we used these proceeds to repay 150 million of 80 senior notes due april 30 2004 and 200 million of 65 senior notes due may 15 2004 with cash on hand we repaid 295 million of 70 senior notes that matured on october 1 2004 we have 100 million of 70 senior notes and 3 million of 665 senior notes both due may 15 2005 that we currently expect to redeem with available cash   taxexempt bonds  — as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 2047 million of outstanding taxexempt bonds we issued approximately 345 million of taxexempt bonds during 2004 35 million of which was issued to refinance higher rate taxexempt bonds we actively issue taxexempt bonds as a means of accessing lowcost financing for capital expenditures the proceeds from these financing arrangements are deposited directly into trust funds and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services as we spend monies on the specific projects being financed we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds as discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above we have approximately 333 million held in trust for future spending as of december 31 2004 during 2004 we received 442 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures   as of december 31 2004 approximately 590 million of our taxexempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us these bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our 24 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us during the second quarter of 2004 we fixed the interest rates of approximately 379 million of taxexempt bonds that had previously been remarketed on a weekly basis 42   because our variablerate taxexempt bonds require letter of credit support fixing the interest rates of these debt instruments resulted in a decrease in our financial assurance needs 

  taxexempt project bonds — as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 496 million of outstanding taxexempt project bonds these debt instruments are primarily used by our wheelabrator group to finance the development of wastetoenergy facilities the bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments as of december 31 2004 approximately 46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our fiveyear revolving credit facility approximately 91 million of these bonds will be repaid with either available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve months   convertible subordinated notes — we had approximately 35 million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid with cash on hand upon maturity on january 24 2005   interest rate swaps — we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2004 the interest payments on approximately 26 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates allowing us to maintain approximately 63 of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 37 at variable interest rates fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by approximately 135 million as of december 31 2004 and approximately 168 million at december 31 2003 

 

   the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions    net cash provided by operating activities  — during both 2003 and 2002 cash generated from operations was positively affected by cash we received of approximately 109 million and 166 million respectively from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities the positive cash receipts during 2002 were offset partially by cash payments of approximately 66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances   cash generated from operations during 2003 was negatively affected by a 223 million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit in the third quarter of 2003 settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during 2003 includes i a final net cash settlement payment net of insurance proceeds of 377 million plus accrued interest ii a total tax benefit of approximately 138 million and iii related net settlement recoveries of approximately 16 million   after adjusting 2003 and 2002 for the unusual items mentioned above our 2004 cash flows from operations increased 178 million over 2003 and 165 million over 2002 our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships are the primary contributors of this increase   net cash used in investing activities  — the primary contributor to the variation in cash used in investing activities is acquisition spending which was 130 million in 2004 337 million in 2003 and 162 million in 2002 in recent years our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuckin acquisitions which are 43   relatively small accretive businesses that will easily integrate with and provide value to our existing operations however our 2003 acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuckin acquisitions particularly in our recycling lineofbusiness our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins we intend to continue to make accretive tuckin investments and expect acquisition spending in 2005 to be approximately 250 million 

  in addition to decreased acquisition spending net receipts from restricted trust fund and escrow accounts in 2004 have increased 73 million over 2003 and 171 million over 2002 as discussed above our restricted trust and escrow accounts are related to our i taxexempt bonds ii closure postclosure and remedial requirements or iii debt service requirements the increase in cash received from these sources is due to increased utilization of this type of financing which is a direct result of the favorable interest rates available   our capital expenditures have been maintained at a manageable range of annual spending of approximately 12 billion to 13 billion we anticipate that our capital expenditures during 2005 will be in the range of 125 billion to 135 billion   additionally we continue to receive cash proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets in january of 2005 we received proceeds of approximately 89 million for the divestiture of one of our landfills due to a divestiture order from the canadian competition bureau from time to time we may be required to divest of certain assets due to governmental regulations   net cash used in financing activities  — the primary reason for the increase in net cash used in financing activities is the payment of our quarterly dividends which resulted in cash dividends of 432 million in 2004 compared with cash dividends of 6 million paid in each of 2003 and 2002 our board of directors approved our quarterly dividend program in august 2003 and we have declared and paid a dividend of 01875 per share of common stock in each quarter of 2004 compared with the annual 001 per share dividend in 2003 and 2002 additionally the board of directors announced that it expects dividends to be 020 per share per quarter beginning in 2005 all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant on january 28 2005 the board declared our first quarterly dividend under the program of 020 per share which will be paid on march 24 2005 to stockholders of record as of march 1 2005   offsetting the increase in cash dividend payments were decreases in share repurchases and net debt repayments and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants we paid approximately 496 million for share repurchases in 2004 as compared to 550 million paid during 2003 and 982 million paid in 2002 our 2004 share repurchases include a cash payment of approximately 24 million to settle repurchases made in december 2003 our 2004 stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a capital allocation program that authorized management to spend up to 1 billion for this activity during the year since the inception of the repurchase program in february 2002 we have repurchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately 2 billion we currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the board in making dividend declarations   net debt repayments were approximately 386 million in 2004 456 million in 2003 and 697 million in 2002 the following summary shows our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during 2004  44      cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises increased to 193 million in 2004 from 52 million in 2003 and 27 million in 2002 increased cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises were driven by the increase in our stock price during the year summary of contractual obligations   the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions  

 

   we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely as a result the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 45   offbalance sheet arrangements   we are party to i lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities and ii guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements these lease agreements are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities at competitive marketdriven prices our thirdparty guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2004 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity seasonal trends and inflation   our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the summer such as the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of 2004 actually increase our revenues in the areas affected although for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenues tend to provide lower margins conversely harsh winter weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of those periods the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities   we believe that inflation has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities new accounting pronouncements   information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

   in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2004 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider creditworthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance   we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements   interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are primarily denominated in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations which directly impacts variability in interest costs 46   an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately 490 million at december 31 2004 and 440 million at december 31 2003 this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 

  we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately 647 million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2004 these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure postclosure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities because of the shortterms of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant   currency rate exposure from time to time we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt there would have been no material impact to our fair value position if there were an instantaneous 10 decrease in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2003 at december 31 2004 we have no foreign currency derivatives outstanding   commodities price exposure we market recycled products such as waste paper aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities we enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales under the swap agreements we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time with regard to our option agreements we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors put options and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings call options additionally we have entered into collars combination of a put and call option with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling we record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings as required all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used an instantaneous 10 increase in recyclable material prices would decrease the fair value of our commodity derivatives by approximately 10 million at december 31 2003 and by approximately 20 million at december 31 2004 this analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity positions that are being hedged   see notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments 47

   the financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation our majorityowned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary see note 19 waste management inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries when the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” are used in this document those terms refer to waste management inc and all of its consolidated subsidiaries when we use the term “wmi” we are referring only to the parent holding company   we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america we provide collection transfer recycling and resource recovery and disposal services we are also a leading developer operator and owner of wastetoenergy facilities in the united states our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities 

 

 

 

 

 

   in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” which requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries a primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity   as it applies to us the effective dates for fin 46 were as follows    the financial statement impact of our implementation of fin 46 is summarized below   special purpose variable interest entities  — on december 31 2003 we began consolidating two limited liability companies from which we lease three wastetoenergy facilities prior to the consolidation of the entities we accounted for the underlying leases as operating leases and accounted for our investment in the llcs under the equity method of accounting upon consolidating these entities we recorded a charge to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of approximately 43 million net of tax benefit or 007 per diluted share the consolidation of these variable interest entities increased income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december 31 2004 by approximately 56   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 4 million net of taxes or 001 per diluted share the following table summarizes the balance sheet impact of consolidation of these entities as of december 31 2003 in millions    nonspecial purpose variable interest entities  — on march 31 2004 our application of fin 46 to nonspecial purpose type variable interest entities resulted in the consolidation of certain trusts established to support the performance of closure postclosure and environmental remediation activities upon consolidating these entities we recorded an increase in our net assets and a credit of approximately 8 million net of taxes or 001 per diluted share as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the consolidation of these variable interest entities has not materially affected our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2004 additionally our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 would not have been significantly impacted by the consolidation of these entities as of the beginning of the earliest year presented therefore the application of fin 46 to these variable interest entities has been excluded from the pro forma disclosures provided below   see note 19 for further discussion on these variable interest entities 

 

   through december 31 2002 we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and we deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants effective january 1 2003 we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded approximately 25 million net of taxes or 004 per diluted share as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles our current method of accounting is preferable because it i provides operating results that more clearly reflect the timing and amount of required expenditures ii more clearly reflects our assets and liabilities and iii reduces the need to make additional estimates and assumptions 57   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 

 

   through december 31 2002 if our customer contracts were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues over the life of the contract we accrued for those future losses effective january 1 2003 we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these losses as they are incurred in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded approximately 30 million net of taxes or 005 per diluted share as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles our current method of accounting is preferable because it i provides operating results that more clearly reflect the timing and amount of contract losses generated ii more clearly reflects our liabilities and iii reduces the need to make additional estimates and assumptions 

 

   in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded approximately 101 million including tax benefit or 017 per diluted share as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the adoption of sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  substantially all of this charge was related to changes in accounting for landfill final capping closure and postclosure costs the initial adoption of sfas no 143 resulted in a 96 million increase in net landfill assets and a 266 million increase in our landfill liabilities of which 67 million related to our current liabilities   see further discussion related to the impact of our adoption of sfas no 143 on our accounting policies under landfill accounting within note 3 

 

   if the accounting changes we implemented during 2003 for special purpose variable interest entities major repairs and maintenance loss contracts and asset retirement obligations had been effective since 2002 the impact on income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and earnings per common share in millions except per share amounts would have been as follows  58   waste management inc

   in 2004 as a result of internal review processes we identified certain items that required modification to our accounting and reporting the following discussion provides information about each of the changes identified and the reclassifications made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform our prior years’ presentation to the current year’s presentation    we have various investments in unconsolidated entities that we account for using the equity method our equity in the earnings of these entities has historically been presented as a component of other income in our statements of operations and the related cash flow impact has been reflected as a component of the change in other assets within our statements of cash flows as a result of investments we made during 2004 as described 59   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued in note 8 this activity has become a more significant component of our net income and operating cash flow activity accordingly we have shown equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities as a separate component within our statement of operations and equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities net of distributions as a separate component of cash provided by operating activities prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation   in march 2002 we adopted a new organizational structure to align collection transportation recycling and disposal resources into market areas and we reduced the number of layers of management and consolidated certain administrative and support functions after the adoption of the new organizational structure we determined that certain employee costs and facilityrelated expenses previously recorded as selling general and administrative expenses were more appropriately classified as operating expenses these costs include certain maintenance and repairs property taxes insurance and claims rent utilities permits and fees costs identified for reclassification are those costs incurred beginning in the second quarter of 2002 as this was the first full accounting period that these organizational changes were effective as a result operating and selling general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2002 are not comparable to those of subsequent periods   additionally certain other minor reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation the supplementary financial information included herein has been updated to reflect these changes 

 

 

 

   the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wmi its majorityowned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities after elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method of accounting as appropriate these investments are regularly reviewed for impairment and propriety of accounting treatment 

 

   in preparing our financial statements we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition of assets liabilities stockholders’ equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty that we make in preparing our financial statements relate to our accounting for landfills environmental liabilities and asset impairments as described below within landfill accounting asset impairments and contingent liabilities 

 

   cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less for discussion regarding the reclassification made to prior years’ balances to conform to the current year’s presentation refer to note 2 60   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 

 

   financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents investments held within our trust funds and escrow accounts accounts receivable and derivative instruments we control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by i placing our assets and other financial interests with a diverse group of creditworthy financial institutions ii holding high quality financial instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument and iii maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit evaluations credit limits and monitoring procedures although generally we do not have collateral requirements in addition our overall credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large number of geographically diverse customers we service at december 31 2004 and 2003 no single customer represented greater than 5 of total accounts receivable 

 

   our receivables are recorded when billed or advanced and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash the carrying value of our receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts represents their estimated net realizable value we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends type of customer such as municipal or nonmunicipal the age of outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions if events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific receivable balances may be impaired further consideration is given to the collectiblity of those balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly pastdue receivable balances are writtenoff when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due also we generally recognize interest income on longterm interestbearing notes receivable as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes 

 

   property and equipment are recorded at cost expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized minor replacements maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred   depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straightline method we assume no salvage value for our depreciable property and equipment the estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows in years    we capitalize certain costs associated with developing or obtaining internaluse software these costs include external direct costs of materials and services used in developing or obtaining the software and payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees directly associated with the software development project we depreciate software development costs over a period of up to five years once the related systems are placed in service we are currently assessing our options with respect to the implementation of a revenue management system with an accumulated cost basis at december 31 2004 of approximately 80 million no impairment of this asset has been required through december 31 2004 although there are certain reasonably possible implementation alternatives that could result in impairment 61   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued   when property and equipment are retired sold or otherwise disposed of the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations as increases or offsets to operating expense for the period 

 

   we lease certain property plant and equipment in the ordinary course of our business our leases have varying terms some may include renewal or purchase options escalation clauses restrictions penalties or other obligations that we consider in determining minimum lease payments the leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases as appropriate   operating leases — management expects that in the normal course of business operating leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases our future operating lease payments for which we are contractually obligated as of december 31 2004 are disclosed in note 10   capital leases — assets under capital leases are capitalized using interest rates appropriate at the inception of each lease and are amortized over either the useful life of the asset or the lease term on a straightline basis the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation our future minimum annual capital lease payments are included in our total future debt obligations as disclosed in note 7 

 

   effective january 1 2003 our method of accounting for landfill final capping closure and postclosure changed as a result of our adoption of sfas no 143 with the exception of the accounting for capitalized and future landfill final capping costs sfas no 143 does not change basic lifecycle accounting the table below compares our historical practices to the method prescribed by sfas no 143  62   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued  63   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued    the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 143 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally additionally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations   landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs are dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs   final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events they then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often as 64   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset however as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense   closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in where appropriate inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain   available airspace — our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity   expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the final expansion permit is likely using the following criteria    these criteria are initially evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits however our policy provides that based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill if these criteria are not met inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed in these circumstances inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 73 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2004 19 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace approximately threefourths of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because legal community or other issues could impede the expansion process while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirement which in many cases were due to statespecific permitting procedures when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 65   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued   after determining the costs at our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed we look at factors such as the waste stream geography and rate of compaction among others to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and likely expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change   it is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner the costs of the landfill including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion may be subject to impairment testing as described below lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher closure and postclosure rates and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace additionally if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving the expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 

 

   all acquisitions since january 1 2000 have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting we allocate the cost of the acquired business to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values thereof these estimates are revised during the allocation period as necessary if and when information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation period generally does not exceed one year to the extent contingencies such as preacquisition environmental matters litigation and related legal fees are resolved or settled during the allocation period such items are included in the revised allocation of the purchase price after the allocation period the effect of changes in such contingencies is included in results of operations in the periods in which the adjustments are determined we do not believe potential differences between our fair value estimates and actual fair values are material   in certain business combinations we agree to pay additional amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals such as targeted revenue levels targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for expanded landfill airspace contingent payments when incurred are recorded as purchase price adjustments or compensation expense as appropriate based on the nature of each contingent payment

   longlived assets consist primarily of property and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets property equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded in our balance sheets based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization the recoverability of longlived assets is tested whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include    if any of these or other indicators occur the asset is reviewed to determine whether there has been an impairment an impairment loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets rather than a single asset if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flow if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an actual thirdparty valuation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs to asset impairments and unusual items several impairment indicators are beyond our control and cannot be predicted with any certainty whether or not they will occur estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below   landfills — certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry 67   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued   goodwill — at least annually we assess whether goodwill is impaired upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances such as those listed above that would indicate that more likely than not the book value of goodwill has been impaired

   we have material financial commitments for final capping closure and postclosure obligations with respect to our landfills we develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel engineers and accountants our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value under the provisions of sfas no 143 absent quoted market prices the estimate of fair value should be based on the best available information including the results of present value techniques in general we contract with third parties to fulfill most of our obligations for final capping closure and postclosure accordingly the fair value of these obligations is based upon quoted and actual prices paid for similar work however we intend to perform some of these activities using internal resources where internal resources are expected to be used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation we add a profit margin to the estimated cost of such services to better reflect the fair value of the obligation when we then perform these services internally the added profit margin is recognized as a component of operating income in the period earned an estimate of fair value should include the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for bearing the uncertainties in cash flows however when using discounted cash flow techniques reliable estimates of market premiums may not be obtainable in the waste industry there is no market for selling the responsibility for final capping closure and postclosure obligations independent of selling the landfill in its entirety accordingly we do not believe that it is possible to develop a methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium and have therefore excluded any such market risk premium from our determination of expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations 72   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued   once we have determined the final capping closure and postclosure costs we inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value during 2004 and 2003 we have inflated these costs in current dollars until the expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 25 we discounted these costs to present value using a creditadjusted riskfree discount rate of 625 and 725 during 2004 and 2003 respectively the creditadjusted riskfree rate is based on the riskfree interest rate on obligations of similar maturity adjusted for our own credit rating changes in our creditadjusted riskfree rate do not change recorded liabilities but subsequently recognized obligations are measured using the revised creditadjusted riskfree rate   we record the estimated fair value of final capping closure and postclosure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity consumed through the current period the liability and corresponding asset are recorded on a perton basis as waste is accepted and deposited at our landfills we assess the appropriateness of our recorded balances annually unless there are indications that a more frequent review is appropriate significant changes in inflation rates or the amount or timing of future final capping closure and postclosure cost estimates associated with airspace to be consumed in future periods typically result in both i a current adjustment to the recorded liability and corresponding adjustment to the landfill asset based on the landfill’s capacity consumed to date and ii a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill any changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our amortization policy which would generally result in amortization expense being recognized prospectively over the remaining capacity of the final capping event or the landfill as appropriate changes in such estimates associated with airspace that has been fully utilized result in an adjustment to the recorded liability and a corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace amortization expense during the year ended december 31 2004 adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the timing and cost of future final capping closure and postclosure of fully utilized airspace resulted in a 20 million credit to landfill airspace amortization expense with the majority of the credit resulting from final capping changes in managing our landfills our engineers look for ways to reduce or defer our construction costs including final capping costs most of the benefit recognized in 2004 is the result of concerted efforts to obtain landfill permit modifications to allow us to final cap a landfill using more cost effective methods landfill expansions that result in reduced or deferred final capping costs or completed final capping construction that cost less than the accrual such adjustments to final capping closure and postclosure were not significant in the prior year   interest accretion on final capping closure and postclosure liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and is recorded as final capping closure and postclosure expense which is included in operating costs and expenses on the income statement   in the united states the final capping closure and postclosure requirements are established by the epa and applied on a statebystate basis the costs to comply with these requirements could change materially as a result of legislation or regulation 

 

   we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates and assumptions as described in note 3 there can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with the likely remedy of a site in these cases we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amounts that are the low ends of such ranges in accordance with sfas no 5 and its interpretations if we used the high ends of such ranges our aggregate potential liability would be approximately 175 million higher on a discounted basis than the 324 million recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2004 73   waste management inc

   we continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are accretive to our nasw operations during the year ended december 31 2004 we completed over 50 acquisitions for a cost net of cash acquired of approximately 130 million these acquisitions primarily affected our eastern midwest and southern groups   during the year ended december 31 2003 we paid 337 million net of cash acquired for the acquisitions of approximately 75 businesses which are included within our nasw operations this included approximately 85 million in the first quarter of 2003 primarily for our acquisition of the peltz group the largest privatelyheld recycler in the united states whose assets we contributed to our recycling group’s operations known as recycle america alliance the most significant of the other transactions was the acquisition of certain collections assets from allied waste industries inc in the third and fourth quarters of 2003   additionally in 2003 we acquired certain operations from bioenergy partners a general partnership in which we have a 50 ownership interest for 18 million bioenergy partners owns and operates facilities that produce electrical power from landfill gas that is ultimately sold to public utilities and other commercial users concurrent with this transaction we received net cash proceeds from bioenergy partners of 30 million in exchange for assuming a like amount of indebtedness of the partnership we continue to account for our remaining interests in bioenergy partners as an equity investment   as a result of the acquisitions in 2003 we recorded approximately 458 million in additional assets including approximately 154 million of goodwill and approximately 65 million of other intangible assets of 97   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued this acquired goodwill approximately 143 million is deductible for income tax purposes additionally as a result of these acquisitions we assumed approximately 117 million of liabilities   in 2002 we completed over 50 acquisitions of nasw operations that were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for approximately 162 million 

 

   the approximate aggregate sales price for the divestiture of our nonintegrated north american operations was approximately 39 million in 2004 18 million in 2003 and 103 million in 2002 these sales were comprised substantially of cash proceeds we recognized net gains on these divestitures of approximately 12 million in 2004 13 million in 2003 and 8 million during 2002 

 

   we have financial interests in various variable interest entities following is a description of all interests that we consider significant for purposes of applying fin 46 we are considered the primary beneficiary of certain of these entities such entities have been consolidated into our financial statements as noted below consolidated variable interest entities   financial interest in surety bonding company  — during the third quarter of 2003 we issued a 286 million letter of credit to support the debt of a surety bonding company established by an unrelated third party to issue surety bonds to the waste industry and other industries the letter of credit serves to guarantee the surety bonding company’s obligations associated with its debt and represents our exposure to loss associated with our financial interest in the entity   as of december 31 2004 approximately 45 million of current assets 6 million of longterm assets 25 million of current liabilities 24 million of longterm debt and 2 million in minority interest have been included in our consolidated balance sheet as a result of applying fin 46 to this variable interest entity   although we are the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity the creditors of the entity do not have recourse against our general credit and our losses are limited to our exposure under the guarantee consolidation of this entity did not materially impact our results of operations during the year ended december 31 2004 or 2003 nor do we anticipate that it will materially impact our results of operations in the foreseeable future see note 10 for additional discussion related to our financial assurance activities   wastetoenergy llcs  — on june 30 2000 two limited liability companies “llcs” were established to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three wastetoenergy facilities that we operate under an agreement with the owner john hancock life insurance company “hancock” has a 995 ownership interest in one of the llcs “llc i” and the second llc “llc ii” is 9975 collectively owned by llc i and the cit group “cit” we own the remaining equity interest in each llc hancock and cit made an initial investment of approximately 167 million in the llcs the llcs used these proceeds to purchase the three wastetoenergy facilities that we operate and assumed the seller’s indebtedness related to these facilities under the llc agreements the llcs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following events i a written decision of all the members of the llcs to dissolve ii december 31 2063 iii the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under the delaware limited liability company act or iv the llcs ceasing to own any interest in the wastetoenergy facilities   income losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based on their initial capital account balances until hancock and cit achieve targeted returns thereafter the earnings of llc i will be allocated 20 to hancock and 80 to us and the earnings of llc ii will be allocated 20 to hancock and cit and 80 to us we do not expect hancock and cit to achieve the targeted returns at any time during the initial base term of 98   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued the leases we are required under certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the llcs in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss amounts and terminated values under the llc agreements to the extent they are different from the underlying lease agreements we believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of these circumstances is remote additionally if we exercise certain renewal options under the leases we will be required to make payments to the llcs for the difference between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents if any   as of december 31 2004 our consolidated balance sheet includes approximately 389 million of net property and equipment associated with the llcs’ wastetoenergy facilities and 130 million of debt associated with the financing of the facilities   trusts for closure postclosure or environmental remediation obligations  — we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of trust funds that were created to settle certain of our closure postclosure or environmental remediation obligations as the trust funds are expected to continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were established we do not believe that there is any material exposure to loss associated with the trusts the consolidation of these variable interest entities has not materially affected our financial position or results of operations in 2004 significant unconsolidated variable interest entities   investments in coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities  — as discussed in note 8 we own an interest in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities along with the other equity investors we support the operations of the entities in exchange for a prorata share of the tax credits generated by the facilities our obligation to support the facilities’ future operations is therefore limited to the tax benefit we expect to receive we are not the primary beneficiary of either of these entities and we do not believe that we have any material exposure to loss as measured under the provisions of fin 46 as a result of our investments as such we account for these investments under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the facilities 

 

   we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western canadian wheelabrator and recycling groups these seven operating groups are presented below as our reportable segments these reportable segments when combined with certain other operations not managed through the seven operating groups comprise our north american solid waste or nasw operations nasw our core business provides integrated waste management services consisting of collection disposal solid waste and hazardous waste landfills transfer wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants that are managed by wheelabrator recycling services and other services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers throughout the united states and in puerto rico and canada the operations not managed through our seven operating groups are presented herein as “other nasw”   early in the third quarter of 2004 we implemented a market realignment that consisted of moving our ohio operations to the midwest group and our kentucky operations to the southern group both of which were previously in the eastern group we believe that the realignment will provide benefits to each of the operating groups affected specifically the ohio market area faces many of the same issues as other industrial regions in the midwest group and the kentucky market area’s rural characteristics make it similar to other markets in the southern group further we believe that reducing the revenues of the eastern group will enable its leadership team to focus on the challenges associated with the northeast corridor as a result of the realignment we have reclassified the operating results of the ohio and kentucky market areas for all periods presented to provide segment financial information that appropriately reflects our approach to managing operations prior period information has also been reclassified to reflect our change in accounting for certain mandatory fees and taxes as described in note 2 99   waste management inc

   historically our quarterly operating results have fluctuated the fluctuations may be caused by many factors including periodtoperiod changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of business and operating segment and general economic conditions our revenues and income from operations typically reflect seasonal patterns our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the summer such as the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of 2004 actually increase our revenues in the areas affected although for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenues tend to be low margin conversely harsh winter weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of those periods the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities   the following table summarizes the unaudited quarterly results of operations for 2004 and 2003 in millions except per share amounts  103   waste management inc

   in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” which amends sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees sfas no 123r requires compensation expense to be recognized for all sharebased payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant eliminating the intrinsic value alternative allowed by sfas no 123 generally the approach to determining fair value under the original pronouncement has not changed however there are revisions to the accounting guidelines established such as accounting for forfeitures that will change our accounting for stockbased awards in the future   sfas no 123r must be adopted in the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2005 the statement allows companies to adopt its provisions using either of the following transition alternatives  108   waste management inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued   we currently plan to adopt sfas no 123r on july 1 2005 using the modified prospective method this change in accounting is not expected to materially impact our financial position however because we currently account for sharebased payments to our employees using the intrinsic value method our results of operations have not included the recognition of compensation expense for the issuance of stock option awards had we applied the fairvalue criteria established by sfas no 123r to previous stock option grants the impact to our results of operations would have approximated the impact of applying sfas no 123 which was a reduction to net income of approximately 57 million in 2004 68 million in 2003 and 85 million in 2002 the impact of applying sfas no 123 to previous stock option grants is further summarized in note 3 we currently expect the recognition of compensation expense for stock options issued and outstanding at december 31 2004 to reduce our 2005 net income by approximately 20 million   sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce our net operating cash inflows and increase our net financing cash flows in periods after adoption excess tax benefits included as a component of operating cash inflows in 2004 2003 and 2002 were 37 million 9 million and 7 million respectively the impact that this change in reporting will have on future periods cannot be determined at this time because the benefit recognized is dependent upon attributes that vary for each option exercise   additionally as a result of both the changes in accounting for sharebased payments and a desire to design our longterm incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to operating and market performance our board of directors has approved a substantial change in the form of awards to be made in 2005 in january 2005 we granted approximately 715000 restricted stock units and approximately 765000 performance share units to selected participants under our 2004 stock incentive plan the restricted stock units will vest ratably over a fouryear period compensation expense associated with these restricted stock units will be recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period the performance share units will be paid in shares of common stock on the third anniversary of the date of grant the number of common shares issued upon the vesting of the performance share units will be proportional to the percentage of the target performance criteria achieved compensation expense associated with these performance share units will be recognized ratably over the vesting period based on our expectations for achieving the defined performance criteria we do not currently plan to make stock option awards a material component of our longterm incentive plan in the future

   we had some positive experiences in 2004 but also some challenges volumes were generally strong throughout 2004 providing the most significant volumerelated revenue growth we had seen in a few years while generating revenue growth from pricing remained difficult we experienced a positive change in yield on base business in 2004 we had reasonable success with price increases to existing customers in our collection line of business in most markets however we continue to experience increased pricing competition in our collection operations characterized by offers from competitors to our customers to provide the same services at much lower prices than we are charging and by lower average rates being offered by the competition on new business bids this was especially prevalent in the midwest group additionally we experienced declines in yield from 2003 to 2004 for our landfill operations due largely to competitive pricing on special waste although those declines were partially offset by increased municipal solid waste pricing   although we saw an economic recovery in 2004 that brought with it increased volumes we did not experience significantly increased pricing we previously implemented a pricing model for our collection operations and recently announced a landfill pricing study pursuant to this study we chose 30 landfills at which we will be increasing pricing on municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste the objective is to gather and analyze information to help us better understand the reactions to the increases which will help us to manage our pricing in the future   we also had continued success in implementing our operational excellence initiatives during 2004 in the area of safety we launched mission to zero in late 2000 with the objective of promoting zero tolerance for unsafe actions conditions and attitudes across the organization our goal is to attain worldclass safety for the protection of our employees customers and communities we continue to see improvements in both our total recordable incident rate and hourly accident recordable rate which are the metrics we use to measure our success in attaining this goal we also continued to make progress in 2004 in the area of fleet maintenance and route optimization the metric we use for our fleet maintenance is maintenance cost per driver hour which we try to improve through basic planning and scheduling of maintenance work as well as enhanced training for our route optimization initiative we use a proprietary software application called wasteroute designed to help us organize our routes more efficiently we believe the optimization initiative has resulted in improved productivity as we continue to reduce the number of routes our plans going forward are to institutionalize the best practices we have identified to support our future productivity improvement   in 2004 we experienced increases in operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses as compared with the prior year however these costs as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat which we believe demonstrates the effectiveness of our cost reduction programs in these areas we experienced the increases in operating expenses that are expected as a result of increased revenues the biggest drivers increasing costs of operations were increased subcontractor costs as a result of higher volumes some of which came from the hurricane clean up work higher costs of goods sold fuel costs and an increase in the cost of steel our costs of goods sold include rebates made by the recycling group to suppliers and are based on market prices of recyclable commodities fuel costs also increased during the year although a significant portion of those costs were offset through our fuel surcharges to customers the increase in dollars spent in 2004 on selling general and administrative costs related to increased salaries and wages and increased commissions and bonuses which are a result of the overall improvement in our operating results additionally we experienced increased professional fees as a result of our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and increased litigation defense and indemnification costs related to legal matters 23     we believe that the production of free cash flow is a very important measure of our liquidity and operating results as it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends repurchase stock and execute our acquisition program free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and is not intended to replace the consolidated statement of cash flows that was prepared in accordance with gaap we generated approximately 106 billion in free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2004 free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities and adding to that the proceeds from divestitures net of cash divested and other sales of assets as shown in the following table in millions    we are projecting fullyear 2005 free cash flow to be in the range of 11 billion to 12 billion based on estimated net cash provided by operating activities being in the range of 225 billion to 235 billion capital expenditures between 125 billion and 135 billion and proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets of 125 million to 150 million 

 

   as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following reclassifications have been made in our prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation  24      additionally certain other minor reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financials statements in order to conform to the current year presentation the financial information included herein has been updated to reflect these changes 

 

   in preparing our financial statements we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets liabilities stockholders’ equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments as described below   landfills  — effective january 1 2003 our method of accounting for landfill closure and postclosure as well as landfill final capping changed as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  through december 31 2002 the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and postclosure obligations on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill this practice referred to as lifecycle accounting within the waste industry continues to be followed with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs as a result of the adoption of sfas no 143 future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 143   the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 143 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations   landfill costs — we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and 25   landfill gas directly related engineering capitalized interest and onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure costs additionally landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property the projection of these landfill costs are dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs 

  final capping costs — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events they then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill we review these costs annually or more often as significant facts change changes in estimates such as timing or cost of construction for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset however as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense   closure and postclosure costs — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain   available airspace — our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity   expansion airspace — we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely using the following criteria    these criteria are initially evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits however our policy provides that based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill if these criteria are not met inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed in these circumstances inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of 26   directors on a quarterly basis of the 73 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2004 19 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace approximately threefourths of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because legal community or other issues could impede the expansion process while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements which in many cases were due to statespecific permitting procedures when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace we also include the projected costs for development as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 

  after determining the costs at our landfills we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed we look at factors such as the waste stream geography and rate of compaction among others to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future these rates per ton are updated annually or more often as significant facts change   it is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner the costs of the landfill including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion may be subject to impairment testing as described below lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher closure and postclosure rates and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace additionally if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately   environmental remediation liabilities  — under current laws and regulations we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business these costs include potentially responsible party “prp” investigation settlement certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site next we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on    asset impairments  — our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization however accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets rather than a 27   single asset if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an actual thirdparty valuation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 

  typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include    if any of these or other indicators occur we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment several of these indicators are beyond our control and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur additionally estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below   landfills  — certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry   goodwill  — at least annually we assess whether goodwill is impaired upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances such as those listed above that would indicate that more likely than not the book value of goodwill has been impaired 28   results of operations   the following table presents for the periods indicated the periodtoperiod change in dollars in millions and percentages for the respective statement of operations line items   29     the following table presents for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that the respective statement of operations line items has to operating revenues  

 

   our operating revenues in 2004 were 125 billion compared to 116 billion in 2003 and 112 billion in 2002 as shown below north american solid waste or “nasw” is our principal operation and is comprised of seven operating groups within north america along with our other nasw services the operations shown as “nonnasw divested operations” in the table below consisted of our nonsolid waste services which were divested as of march 31 2002  30     our nasw operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties generally based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semimonthly fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site and are normally billed monthly recycling revenue which is generated by our recycling group as well as our five geographic operating groups generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements   the mix of nasw operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions    the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in nasw revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes    base business  — base business yield improvements contributed to increased revenues in our collection transfer and wastetoenergy operations in 2004 as compared with 2003 in our collection business the most substantial yield improvements during 2004 were in our industrial and residential operations where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout 2004 has been positive it was affected by increased price competition particularly in the midwest and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the south the base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout 2004 31   have been almost exclusively attributable to the eastern portion of the united states however increased pricing in our transfer business in the east has negatively affected our volumerelated revenue in that region the base business yield increases during 2004 have been partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations this decline is primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste particularly in the south and midwest which has been partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal 

  in 2003 the increase in base business yield as compared to 2002 was attributable to our collection transfer and wastetoenergy businesses with a significant increase in our residential collection operations certain of these price increases related to additional costs and taxes were passed on to our customers however the increase was partially offset by our landfill business where we experienced decreases in pricerelated revenue principally due to our special waste landfill operations mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the southern and western portions of the united states   commodity  — our revenues in both 2004 and 2003 were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process average prices for old corrugated cardboard were up approximately 33 during the year from 64 per ton in 2003 to 85 per ton in 2004 average prices for old newsprint have also improved yearoveryear by approximately 25 from 69 per ton in 2003 to 86 per ton in 2004 however a significant portion of increases from commodity prices is rebated to our suppliers thereby increasing our cost of goods sold resulting in a relatively small impact to our income from operations   fuel surcharges and fees  — we experienced revenue improvements during 2004 due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges fuel surcharges increased revenues yearoveryear by approximately 53 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and approximately 33 million for the year ended december 31 2003 these increases were more than offset by increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices as discussed in operating expenses — fuel    volume  — during 2004 we experienced significant volumerelated revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses driven principally by our southern and western groups a substantial portion of volumerelated revenue growth is due to the volume increases each of our operating groups has experienced in its industrial collection operations in the southern and western portions of the united states our residential collection and transfer volumes have also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout the year additionally hurricane cleanup efforts increased the southern group’s 2004 volumerelated revenues by approximately 115 million landfill volume increases have also provided significant revenue improvements during 2004 the volume increases in our landfill business have been the most significant in the south and west where increases in both construction and demolition waste and special waste have been substantial excluding the impact of hurricanes we believe that a relatively strong economic environment has driven our volumerelated revenue improvements   our revenue due to volumes decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily in our collection and recycling businesses we believe the 2003 declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition particularly in the eastern and midwestern portions of the united states our loss of a contract with the city of chicago during february 2003 was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling accounting for lost revenues of approximately 60 million for the year ended december 31 2003 partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills primarily in the southern and western portions of the united states   acquisitions  — in 2004 the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from allied waste industries inc in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 other acquisitions of recycling transfer and wastetoenergy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of 2003 also provided increases in revenues during 2004 in 2003 we also acquired the peltz group the largest privatelyheld recycler in the united states 32   

 

   our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits which include salaries and wages related payroll taxes insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor ii transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations iii maintenance and repairs relating to both equipment and facilities iv subcontractor costs which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities v costs of goods sold which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities vi fuel costs which represent the costs of fuel and oils to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes which include landfill taxes host community fees and royalties and viii other operating costs which include equipment and facility rent property taxes insurance and claims costs and landfill operating costs   the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses including the impact of foreign currency translation for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions    when comparing the year ended december 31 2002 to other periods our 2002 restructuring as discussed below within restructuring  resulted in the recharacterization of certain labor and facilityrelated costs through march 31 2002 these costs were included within other selling general and administrative costs after the adoption of the new organizational structure these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since april 1 2002 when the organizational changes became effective the components of operating expenses impacted are labor and related benefits as well as other operating expenses   labor and related benefits  — after excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling general and administrative costs as discussed above these costs have increased yearover year as a result of i higher salaries and hourly wages when compared with the prior year due to annual merit increases ii increased overtime costs due in part to increased volumes and iii salary and hourly wage costs related to acquisitions additionally the increases in 2004 and to a lesser extent in 2003 have been partially offset by savings realized as a result of our 2003 workforce reductions   transfer and disposal costs  — the increases are due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions   subcontractor costs  — these cost increases during 2004 as compared with the prior year are primarily due to higher volumes we have experienced throughout the year including increased subcontractor costs of approximately 78 million in 2004 attributable to hurricane cleanup services provided by our southern group also contributing to the increases are i the impact of acquisitions ii increased thirdparty transportation costs in our western group due to the service requirements of certain event work iii higher fuel surcharges paid to third party subcontractors and iv additional transportation costs in our eastern group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills 33     in 2003 we also experienced to a lesser extent the effects of the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints in the eastern group additionally we had increased subcontractor costs in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to i increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business ii general volume increases and iii increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services   cost of goods sold  — our recycling group provides our suppliers with rebates that are driven by market prices of recyclable commodities which means that the increase in cost of goods sold correlates directly to the increase in the market prices of these commodities and our revenue yield   fuel  — we experienced an average increase of 030 per gallon for 2004 as compared with 2003 and in 2003 we experienced an average increase of 019 per gallon over 2002 however a significant portion of this cost increase is offset by our fuel surcharges to customers which are reflected as fuel price increases within our operating revenues section above   other operating expenses  — the primary reason for the decrease during 2004 as compared with 2003 is the impact of the december 31 2003 consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities from which we lease three wastetoenergy facilities prior to the consolidation of these entities we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases the consolidation of these entities has therefore resulted in a decline in rental expense in 2004 which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation interest expense and minority interest expense additionally in 2004 we experienced increased landfill and environmental costs but had partially offsetting gains from the sale of certain assets   after excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling general and administrative costs as discussed above the increase in 2003 other operating expenses over 2002 is partially attributable to i increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately 24 million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of sfas no 143 and ii increased risk management expenses of approximately 20 million largely as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs 

 

   our selling general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs which include salaries related insurance and benefits contract labor and payroll taxes ii professional fees which include fees for consulting legal audit and tax services iii provision for bad debts which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and iv other general and administrative expenses which include facilityrelated expenses voice and data telecommunications advertising travel and entertainment rentals postage and printing   the following table summarizes the major components of our selling general and administrative costs for the year ended december 31 for the respective periods in millions    labor and related benefits  — we realized an increase in labor and related benefits for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with the prior year primarily attributable to i increased commissions paid to our sales personnel ii higher salaries and hourly wages that were partially offset by the 2003 workforce reduction and iii higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance for 2004 a decline in our use of contract labor has partially offset these increases 34     during the year ended december 31 2003 the overall reduction in labor and related benefits was a result of reductions in salary and other laborrelated costs which were primarily derived from our march 2002 reorganization and february and june 2003 restructurings   professional fees  — we experienced increases in professional fees for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with the year ended december 31 2003 as a result of higher litigation and defense costs and consulting fees for both general business reasons and our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we did not see a significant fluctuation in professional fees between the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002   other selling general and administrative costs  — during 2003 we obtained favorable settlements for legal disputes which are driving the apparent increase in costs in 2004 as compared with 2003 after excluding this impact we have maintained our cost reduction efforts that were put in place in 2003 in 2003 management focused on reducing spending related to travel and entertainment and other administrative costs   this focus on cost reduction is a primary factor for the lower other selling general and administrative costs for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared with 2002 additionally in 2002 we experienced increases in our legal reserves that resulted in an unfavorable effect on results as compared with 2003   also when comparing the year ended december 31 2002 to other periods our 2002 restructuring as discussed below within restructuring resulted in the recharacterization of certain labor and facilityrelated costs through march 31 2002 these costs were included within other selling general and administrative costs after the adoption of the new organizational structure these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since april 1 2002 which is when the organizational changes became effective 

 

   depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of intangible assets with a definite life either using a 150 declining balance approach or a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset ii depreciation of property and equipment on a straightline basis from three to 50 years iii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site and iv amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event   the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily related to i an increase in our landfill amortization rate net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs of 019 per ton and to a lesser extent an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes ii increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprisewide software systems into service during the latter half of 2003 and iii increased depreciation expense for our wheelabrator group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities the increase in our landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization in 2004 was partially offset by the impact of approximately 18 million of incremental changes related to our final capping closure and post closure obligations due to i the addition of new landfill expansions and the removal of certain expansions from the landfill cost base ii permit modifications iii the settlement of final capping events and iv changes in certain estimates that are derived from an annual review which occurs in the fourth quarter of each year depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003 

 

   in 2002 we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic groups to better align collection transport recycling and disposal resources as part of the restructuring we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately 1900 fieldlevel administrative and operational 35   positions in 2002 we recorded 38 million in pretax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure these charges included 36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and 2 million related to abandoned operating lease agreements all payments related to this restructuring have been made 

  in february 2003 we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization as a result we incurred approximately 20 million in onetime employee severance and benefit costs the operational efficiencies provided by the february 2003 organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in june 2003 we recorded 24 million of pretax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during 2003   during 2004 we recorded a 1 million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with these workforce reductions as of december 31 2004 substantially all obligations associated with the february restructuring and workforce reduction have been paid the first quarter of 2005 is the final period we are obligated to make any severance payments to employees associated with the february 2003 reorganization and workforce reduction approximately 1 million remains accrued as of december 31 2004 for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of the june 2003 workforce reduction which will be paid to certain employees through the third quarter of 2005 

 

   in 2004 the net gain of 13 million for asset impairments and unusual items related to i 17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs ii 15 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain portolet operations and iii 15 million of gains in 2004 related to adjustments we made to our estimated obligations associated with our nonnasw divested operations and our receipt of cash from a thirdparty for a previously settled remedial obligation   during 2003 we recorded a net gain of 8 million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of 13 million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset in part by 5 million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges   in 2002 the net gain of 34 million for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to i our receipt of approximately 11 million related to a previously impaired nonrevenue producing asset ii net gains of approximately 8 million on divestitures during the year and iii reductions to legal reserves of approximately 8 million and loss contract reserves of approximately 7 million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items 

 

   we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western canadian wheelabrator and recycling groups these groups when combined with certain other operations comprise our nasw operations the operations not managed through our seven operating groups are presented herein as “other nasw”   as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements charges associated with our restructuring and workforce reductions impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in 2003 and 2002 the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended december 31 36   for each respective period and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments’ operating results in millions 

   canadian  — while general economic factors such as foreign currency rates favorably affected operating results yearoveryear a favorable legal settlement of 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an unfavorable legal settlement of 26 million in 2002 were the primary drivers of these changes   eastern  — operating income improvement from 2003 to 2004 was driven primarily by i revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business partially offset by volume declines in transfer residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year ii higher operating expenses incurred in 2003 due to the first quarter’s harsh weather conditions and iii acquisitions these earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill the most significant factors affecting the decline from 2002 to 2003 were i lower collection and landfill volumes ii increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the united states iii general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs and iv harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2003   midwest  — lower operating income in 2003 as compared with 2002 was primarily due to i the harsh winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2003 ii soft economic conditions leading to lower volume and iii an increase in competitive activity leading to price rollbacks and lost business these economic and competitive pressures continued to impact the midwest’s results during 2004   southern  — operating income in 2004 has been favorably affected by i positive internal revenue growth largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations ii acquisitions iii increased revenue during the second half of 2004 as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter iv favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2004 largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout 2004 and v various operating and administrative cost reductions these improvements were partially offset by the writeoff of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of 2004 results for the southern group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003   western  — the 2004 increase is primarily attributable to revenue growth which is largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations these gains were partially offset by i increased labor costs ii higher fuel costs not passed on to customers and iii increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs results for the western group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003   wheelabrator  — the increase in 2004 operating income was due in large part to i positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on longterm disposal contracts and ii the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december 31 2003 which has increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs partially offset by 37   increases in depreciation expense the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense wheelabrator’s 2003 operating results were favorably affected by an 11 million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented 

  recycling  — the recycling group’s 2004 operating revenues have been favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for recycling commodities improvements in the market prices for these commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers these favorable market conditions were the primary drivers of the current year’s increase in earnings 

 

   the following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions   

 

   in 2004 net interest expense decreased approximately 42 million when compared with 2003 which is due to a 58 million increase in interest income from 12 million in 2003 to 70 million in 2004 this increase is due primarily to interest income of 46 million realized on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits partially offsetting the benefit of the current year increase in interest income is a 16 million increase in interest expense which is primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december 31 2003 as a result of our implementation of fin 46   the decline in net interest expense in 2003 when compared with 2002 can be largely attributed to our increased utilization of taxexempt financing which contributed to a decline in our weighted average interest rate for the period   for all periods we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates the combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in interest expense reductions of approximately 90 million for 2004 approximately 96 million for 2003 and approximately 86 million for 2002 while we expect the benefits of our interest rate derivative contracts to continue in 2005 the benefit derived from our interest rate contracts will be impacted by changes in shortterm rates on our active agreements and will decline as the debt associated with terminated contracts matures   of the 90 million in reductions to interest expense realized in 2004 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements 48 million related to the amortization of terminated swaps our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by 42 million in 2005 41 million in 2006 and 37 million in 2007 

 

   in the first and second quarters of 2004 we acquired an equity interest in two coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities we account for our investments in these entities using the equity method of accounting 38   and their related losses are the reason for the 2004 versus 2003 change in equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities these equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for income taxes if for any reason the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under section 29 of the internal revenue code we would no longer incur these equity losses additional information related to these investments is included in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   the increase in 2004 minority interest expense over prior years was primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities on december 31 2003 as a result of our implementation of fin 46 this increase was more than offset by an increase in our income from operations as a result of consolidating the entities additional information related to these investments is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   our other income and expense in 2003 and 2004 is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation   we experienced a significant impact to other income in 2002 due primarily to the sale of an equity investment in 2002 a company in which we held an approximately 17 interest was acquired by another entity we also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition the proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 

 

   we recorded a provision for income taxes of 247 million for 2004 404 million for 2003 and 422 million for 2002 resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 210 360 and 340 for each of the three years respectively   the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2004 is primarily due to i the realization of nonconventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills and our investments in the coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities discussed above within equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities and ii the realization of a net benefit of approximately 101 million for tax audit settlements that occurred during the year offset in part by iii state and local income taxes the decrease of approximately 131 million in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in the coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities discussed above   the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes offset in part by nonconventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills additionally in 2003 we recognized a 6 million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits in 2002 we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture a tax benefit of approximately 31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carryback of losses by our dutch subsidiary   see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

   on march 31 2004 we recorded a credit of approximately 8 million net of taxes or 001 per diluted share as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by fin 46 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 39     in the first and fourth quarters of 2003 we recorded net of tax charges of 46 million and 43 million respectively to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below    in the first quarter of 2002 we recorded a credit of 2 million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 141 accounting for business combinations liquidity and capital resources 

 

   as an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations however we operate in a capitalintensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength in the past we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future these factors include    we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows our liquidity and our capital resources enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet iii refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy and materials recovery facilities iv the container and equipment needs of our operations and v capping closure and postclosure activities at our landfills beginning in 2002 we committed ourselves to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment 40   through our share repurchase program and in 2004 began a quarterly dividend program our board of directors has approved a new capital allocation program that provides for up to 12 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during 2005 2006 and 2007 we also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business 

  on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” became law a provision of the act temporarily reduces the tax rate on repatriated income if the income is permanently reinvested in the us we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this legislation which includes an analysis of the funds provided by our canadian operations available for repatriation however we do not expect this legislation to materially impact our consolidated liquidity position 

 

   the following is a summary of our cash restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 in millions    cash and cash equivalents  — cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less   restricted trust and escrow accounts  — restricted trusts and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations funds deposited in connection with landfill closure postclosure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits these balances are primarily included within longterm other assets in our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion   debt  — revolving credit and letter of credit facilities — the table below summarizes the credit capacity maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and principal letter of credit facilities outstanding at december 31 2004 in millions we also had an additional 88 million in 41   outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2004 that have been issued under various arrangements none of which provide for committed capacity 

 

 

   we have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs certain taxexempt bond issuances municipal and governmental waste management contracts closure and postclosure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits these facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit we expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs   on october 15 2004 we renegotiated our threeyear 650 million and fiveyear 175 billion revolving credit facilities replacing them with a single fiveyear 24 billion syndicated revolving credit facility   senior notes  — during march 2004 we issued 350 million of 50 senior notes due march 15 2014 the net proceeds of the offering were approximately 346 million after deducting underwriters’ discounts and expenses we used these proceeds to repay 150 million of 80 senior notes due april 30 2004 and 200 million of 65 senior notes due may 15 2004 with cash on hand we repaid 295 million of 70 senior notes that matured on october 1 2004 we have 100 million of 70 senior notes and 3 million of 665 senior notes both due may 15 2005 that we currently expect to redeem with available cash   taxexempt bonds  — as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 2047 million of outstanding taxexempt bonds we issued approximately 345 million of taxexempt bonds during 2004 35 million of which was issued to refinance higher rate taxexempt bonds we actively issue taxexempt bonds as a means of accessing lowcost financing for capital expenditures the proceeds from these financing arrangements are deposited directly into trust funds and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services as we spend monies on the specific projects being financed we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds as discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above we have approximately 333 million held in trust for future spending as of december 31 2004 during 2004 we received 442 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures   as of december 31 2004 approximately 590 million of our taxexempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us these bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our 24 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us during the second quarter of 2004 we fixed the interest rates of approximately 379 million of taxexempt bonds that had previously been remarketed on a weekly basis 42   because our variablerate taxexempt bonds require letter of credit support fixing the interest rates of these debt instruments resulted in a decrease in our financial assurance needs 

  taxexempt project bonds — as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 496 million of outstanding taxexempt project bonds these debt instruments are primarily used by our wheelabrator group to finance the development of wastetoenergy facilities the bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments as of december 31 2004 approximately 46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our fiveyear revolving credit facility approximately 91 million of these bonds will be repaid with either available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve months   convertible subordinated notes — we had approximately 35 million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid with cash on hand upon maturity on january 24 2005   interest rate swaps — we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2004 the interest payments on approximately 26 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates allowing us to maintain approximately 63 of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 37 at variable interest rates fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by approximately 135 million as of december 31 2004 and approximately 168 million at december 31 2003 

 

   the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december 31 for each respective period in millions    net cash provided by operating activities  — during both 2003 and 2002 cash generated from operations was positively affected by cash we received of approximately 109 million and 166 million respectively from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities the positive cash receipts during 2002 were offset partially by cash payments of approximately 66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances   cash generated from operations during 2003 was negatively affected by a 223 million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit in the third quarter of 2003 settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during 2003 includes i a final net cash settlement payment net of insurance proceeds of 377 million plus accrued interest ii a total tax benefit of approximately 138 million and iii related net settlement recoveries of approximately 16 million   after adjusting 2003 and 2002 for the unusual items mentioned above our 2004 cash flows from operations increased 178 million over 2003 and 165 million over 2002 our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships are the primary contributors of this increase   net cash used in investing activities  — the primary contributor to the variation in cash used in investing activities is acquisition spending which was 130 million in 2004 337 million in 2003 and 162 million in 2002 in recent years our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuckin acquisitions which are 43   relatively small accretive businesses that will easily integrate with and provide value to our existing operations however our 2003 acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuckin acquisitions particularly in our recycling lineofbusiness our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins we intend to continue to make accretive tuckin investments and expect acquisition spending in 2005 to be approximately 250 million 

  in addition to decreased acquisition spending net receipts from restricted trust fund and escrow accounts in 2004 have increased 73 million over 2003 and 171 million over 2002 as discussed above our restricted trust and escrow accounts are related to our i taxexempt bonds ii closure postclosure and remedial requirements or iii debt service requirements the increase in cash received from these sources is due to increased utilization of this type of financing which is a direct result of the favorable interest rates available   our capital expenditures have been maintained at a manageable range of annual spending of approximately 12 billion to 13 billion we anticipate that our capital expenditures during 2005 will be in the range of 125 billion to 135 billion   additionally we continue to receive cash proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets in january of 2005 we received proceeds of approximately 89 million for the divestiture of one of our landfills due to a divestiture order from the canadian competition bureau from time to time we may be required to divest of certain assets due to governmental regulations   net cash used in financing activities  — the primary reason for the increase in net cash used in financing activities is the payment of our quarterly dividends which resulted in cash dividends of 432 million in 2004 compared with cash dividends of 6 million paid in each of 2003 and 2002 our board of directors approved our quarterly dividend program in august 2003 and we have declared and paid a dividend of 01875 per share of common stock in each quarter of 2004 compared with the annual 001 per share dividend in 2003 and 2002 additionally the board of directors announced that it expects dividends to be 020 per share per quarter beginning in 2005 all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant on january 28 2005 the board declared our first quarterly dividend under the program of 020 per share which will be paid on march 24 2005 to stockholders of record as of march 1 2005   offsetting the increase in cash dividend payments were decreases in share repurchases and net debt repayments and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants we paid approximately 496 million for share repurchases in 2004 as compared to 550 million paid during 2003 and 982 million paid in 2002 our 2004 share repurchases include a cash payment of approximately 24 million to settle repurchases made in december 2003 our 2004 stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a capital allocation program that authorized management to spend up to 1 billion for this activity during the year since the inception of the repurchase program in february 2002 we have repurchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately 2 billion we currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the board in making dividend declarations   net debt repayments were approximately 386 million in 2004 456 million in 2003 and 697 million in 2002 the following summary shows our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during 2004  44      cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises increased to 193 million in 2004 from 52 million in 2003 and 27 million in 2002 increased cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises were driven by the increase in our stock price during the year summary of contractual obligations   the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions  

 

   we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely as a result the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 45   offbalance sheet arrangements   we are party to i lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities and ii guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements these lease agreements are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities at competitive marketdriven prices our thirdparty guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31 2004 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity seasonal trends and inflation   our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends additionally certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the summer such as the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of 2004 actually increase our revenues in the areas affected although for several reasons including significant startup costs such revenues tend to provide lower margins conversely harsh winter weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect the operating results of those periods the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities   we believe that inflation has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities new accounting pronouncements   information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

   in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2004 all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider creditworthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance   we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements   interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are primarily denominated in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations which directly impacts variability in interest costs 46   an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately 490 million at december 31 2004 and 440 million at december 31 2003 this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 

  we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately 647 million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2004 these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure postclosure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities because of the shortterms of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant   currency rate exposure from time to time we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany canadiancurrency denominated debt there would have been no material impact to our fair value position if there were an instantaneous 10 decrease in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2003 at december 31 2004 we have no foreign currency derivatives outstanding   commodities price exposure we market recycled products such as waste paper aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities we enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales under the swap agreements we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time with regard to our option agreements we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors put options and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings call options additionally we have entered into collars combination of a put and call option with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling we record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings as required all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used an instantaneous 10 increase in recyclable material prices would decrease the fair value of our commodity derivatives by approximately 10 million at december 31 2003 and by approximately 20 million at december 31 2004 this analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity positions that are being hedged   see notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments 47

 item 1 business general   the financial statements in this report represent the consolidation of waste management inc a delaware corporation its majorityowned subsidiaries and entities required to be consolidated pursuant to the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” waste management inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries the terms “the company” “we” “us” or “our” refer to waste management inc and its consolidated subsidiaries   we are the leading provider of integrated waste services in north america through our subsidiaries we provide collection transfer recycling and resource recovery and disposal services we are also a leading developer operator and owner of wastetoenergy facilities in the united states our customers include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entities during 2003 none of our customers accounted for more than 1 of our operating revenue we employed approximately 51700 people as of december 31 2003   our parent company was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name “usa waste services inc” and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in a 1998 merger waste management inc became a 100 owned subsidiary and changed its name to waste management holdings inc at the same time our parent company changed its name to waste management inc our principal executive offices are located at 1001 fannin street suite 4000 houston texas 77002 our telephone number at that address is 713 5126200 our website address is httpwwwwmcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k are all available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the sec our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “wmi” strategy   our goals are operational excellence and financial strength which we seek by concentrating on i providing excellent customer service ii lowering costs iii increasing cash flow and iv maintaining our credit ratings at investment grade we focus and continue to make progress on the following key initiatives  1    operations 

 

   we manage and evaluate our operations through seven operating groups five of which are organized by geographic area and the other two of which are organized by function the geographic groups include our eastern midwest southern western and canadian groups and our two functional groups are the recycling and wheelabrator groups in 2002 we reorganized our operations to form market areas within the geographic groups that are responsible for the sales marketing and delivery of our services we believe that this structure which resulted in the elimination of one layer of field operations and two layers of administrative and support staff better aligns our collection transport recycling and disposal resources additionally we believe that the geographic structure results in a better use of our resources and more efficient service to our customers we manage and evaluate our business through the seven groups which represent our reportable segments   these reportable segments when combined with certain other operations not managed through any of the seven groups comprise our north american solid waste or nasw operations nasw our core business provides integrated waste management services consisting of collection disposal solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants that are managed by wheelabrator and recycling and other miscellaneous services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers throughout the united states puerto rico and canada the operations not managed through our seven groups which include methane gas recovery rentals inplant services and other miscellaneous services are presented in this report as “other nasw”   until december 31 2001 our operations included waste management operations in mexico and certain countries outside of north america and until march 31 2002 included nonsolid waste operations these divested operations are presented in this report as “other” although we no longer hold any revenue generating assets related to the other operations we continue to incur minimal administrative expenses in connection with these divested operations 2     the table below shows the total revenues in millions contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the threeyear period ended december 31 2003 the 2002 and 2001 information has been restated to conform to the current year presentation which includes our newly formed recycling group more information about our results of operations by reportable segment is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report  

 

   the services provided by our nasw segments include collection landfill solid and hazardous waste landfills transfer wheelabrator wastetoenergy facilities and independent power production plants and recycling and other services as described below the following table shows revenues in millions contributed by these services for each of the three years indicated    collection our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to a transfer station or disposal site we generally provide collection services under two types of arrangements  3      landfill landfills are the main depository for solid waste in north america and we have the largest network of landfills in north america solid waste landfills are built and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are operated under prescribed procedures a landfill must be maintained to meet federal state or provincial and local regulations the operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes excavation construction of liners continuous spreading and compacting of waste covering of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing final capping of the landfill these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes   all solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill we believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate which we refer to as internalization rather than using third party disposal facilities internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows the fees charged at disposal facilities which are referred to as tipping fees are based on market factors and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited   we also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states under federal environmental laws all hazardous waste landfills must be permitted by the federal government all of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste these landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards only hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets regulatory requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform wastes into inert materials that are no longer hazardous our hazardous waste landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide longterm containment of waste we also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous wastes in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial geological confining layers   we owned or operated 284 solid waste and five hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2003 compared with 288 solid waste landfills and five hazardous waste landfills at december 31 2002 the landfills that we operate but do not own are generally operated under a lease agreement or an operating contract the differences between the two arrangements usually relate to the owner of the landfill operating permit generally with a lease agreement the permit is in our name and we operate the landfill for its entire life and make payments to the lessor who is generally a private landowner based either on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received we are generally responsible for closure and postclosure requirements under our lease agreements for operating contracts the owner of the property generally a municipality usually owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term which may be the life of the landfill the property owner is generally responsible for closure and postclosure obligations under our operating contracts   based on remaining permitted capacity as of december 31 2003 and projected annual disposal volumes the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 26 years many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion we are currently seeking expansion permits at 84 of our landfills for which we consider expansions to be probable although no assurances can be made that all future expansions 4   will be permitted as designed the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 36 years when considering remaining permitted capacity probable expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume at december 31 2003 and 2002 the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below in millions 

   the following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes as measured in tons of waste for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 in millions  

 

   the estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and probable expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume in years as of december 31 2003 is as follows  5     the volume of waste as measured in tons that we received in 2003 and 2002 at all of our landfills is shown below tons in thousands  

 

   when a landfill we own or operate i reaches its permitted waste capacity ii is permanently capped and iii receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency management of the site including any remediation activities is generally transferred to our closed sites management group at december 31 2003 we manage 173 closed landfills most of which are managed by our closed sites management group   transfer transfer stations are located near residential and commercial collection routes where collection trucks take the solid waste that has been collected the solid waste is then consolidated and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites fees at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred the distance to the disposal site and general market factors at december 31 2003 we owned or operated 366 transfer stations in north america there are two main reasons for using transfer stations    the transfer stations that we operate but do not own are generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties there are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract generally for municipalities in most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for all of the regulatory requirements in accordance with the lease and operating agreement terms   wheelabrator through wheelabrator we own or operate 17 wastetoenergy facilities that accept solid waste for disposal fees at our wastetoenergy facilities are influenced by the market rates for electricity type and volume of waste received and other general market factors our wastetoenergy facilities are capable of processing up to 24250 tons of solid waste each day in 2003 our wastetoenergy facilities received 6   approximately 77 million total tons or approximately 21200 tons per day compared to approximately 75 million total tons or approximately 20700 tons per day in 2002 the solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers at these facilities producing heat that is converted into highpressure steam we use that steam to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities under longterm contracts our wastetoenergy facilities can generate up to an aggregate of 690 megawatts “mw” of renewable electricity per hour 

  our wheelabrator operations also include six independent power production plants that convert various waste and conventional fuels into electricity and steam fees at our independent power production plants are influenced by the market rates for electricity and steam type and volume of waste received and other general market factors the plants burn wood waste anthracite coal waste culm tires landfill gas and natural gas these facilities are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste tires railroad ties and utility poles our anthracite culm facility in pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago ash remaining after burning the culm piles at the facility is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining in addition to electricity production the plants also produce steam which is sold to industrial and commercial users the plants can produce a total of 246 mw of electricity per hour   recycling our recycling group is comprised of recycle america alliance llc “raa” raa was formed in january 2003 to improve the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs and includes certain recycling assets transferred from our geographic operating groups as well as assets contributed by the peltz group who maintains approximately nine percent of the equity interest in raa in addition to our recycling group our five geographic operating groups provide certain recycling services the recycling services provided by other than raa are generally those which are embedded within the groups’ other operations and therefore were not transferred to raa   recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition our recycling operations include the following    recycling fees are influenced by frequency of collection type and volume or weight of the recyclable material degree of processing required the market value of the recovered material and other market factors   other nasw we develop operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our waste management renewable energy program the natural breakdown of waste deposited in a landfill 7   produces landfill gas the methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel for a number of industrial and commercial applications we actively pursue landfill gas beneficial use projects and at december 31 2003 are producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 85 of our solid waste landfills for 54 of these landfills the processed gas is delivered to electricity generators the electricity is then sold to public utilities municipal utilities or power cooperatives for 29 landfills the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes such as steam boilers cement kilns and utility plants at the remaining two landfills we further process the gas to pipelinequality natural gas and then we sell it to natural gas suppliers 

  in addition as part of our other operations we rent and service portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name portolet® and provide street and parking lot sweeping services we also provide inplant services in which we outsource our employees to provide full service waste management to customers at their plants our vertically integrated waste management operations allow us to provide these customers with full management of their waste including finding recycling opportunities minimizing their waste determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and transporting and disposing of their waste competition   the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publiclyheld solid waste companies private solid waste companies and large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills the municipalities and regional governmental authorities can subsidize the cost of service through the use of tax revenues and taxexempt financing and therefore have a competitive advantage   operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense competition based on quality of service and pricing under certain customer service contracts our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers may be limited from time to time competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts employees   at december 31 2003 we had approximately 51700 fulltime employees of which approximately 8000 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations approximately 14800 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that we negotiate with unions we have not experienced a significant work stoppage and management considers its employee relations to be good financial assurance and insurance obligations 

 

   financial assurance is generally required in municipal and governmental waste management contracts it is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits municipal and governmental waste management contracts typically require performance bonds or bank letters of credit to secure performance we are also required to provide various forms of financial assurance for estimated closure postclosure and remedial obligations at our landfills 8     we establish financial assurance in different ways depending on the jurisdiction including escrowtype accounts funded by revenues during the operational life of a facility letters of credit surety bonds trust agreements and insurance although the supply of financial assurance instruments has become increasingly limited in recent years we have not experienced an unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the financial assurance instruments required for our current operations the following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts in millions of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of december 31 2003  

 

 9     the restricted funds held in our trust funds and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the closure postclosure and remedial obligations for which the trust and escrow agreements were established other than these permitted draws on funds virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past and considering our current financial position management does not expect that these instruments will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity we are continually evaluating various options to access costeffective sources of financial assurance 

 

   we also carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability automobile liability real and personal property workers’ compensation directors’ and officers’ liability pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy our workers compensation auto and general liability insurance programs have per incident deductibles of 750000 20000 and 2 million respectively except as discussed in notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements we do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental or other contingency to be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows regulation   our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state or provincial and local environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by the environmental protection agency and various other federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use health and safety agencies in the united states and various agencies in canada many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations   because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related either directly or indirectly to environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state or provincial and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or maintain necessary required permits and approvals there cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain necessary governmental approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage   the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below  10      there are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations sometimes states’ regulations are more strict than comparable federal laws and regulations additionally our collection and landfill operations could be affected by the trend toward requiring the development of waste reduction and recycling programs and legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at the source and waste recycling   various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance was unconstitutional however other courts have refused to apply the supreme court precedent in various circumstances in addition from time to time the united states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste these congressional efforts have to date been unsuccessful the united states congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control the adoption of legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the state level or the courts’ interpretation or validation of flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid waste management services   many states provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or permit holder’s compliance history some states provinces and local jurisdictions go further 11   and consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

  see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of regulations on our current and future operations factors influencing future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements   when we make statements containing projections about our accounting and finances plans and objectives for the future future economic performance or when we make statements containing any other projections or estimates about our assumptions relating to these types of statements we are making forwardlooking statements these statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues earnings or other aspects of our operations or operating results we make these statements in an effort to keep stockholders and the public informed about our business and have based them on our current expectations about future events you should view such statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events all phases of our business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which we have no control over any of these factors either alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement as a result of future events or developments   outlined below are some of the risks that we face and that could affect our business and financial position for 2004 and beyond however they are not the only risks that we face there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position 

 

   we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners particularly as a result of the contamination of drinking water sources or soil under current law we could even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in the ordinary course of our business we have in the past and may in the future become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in which    the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in among other things material increases in our liabilities   from time to time we have received citations or notices from governmental authorities that our operations are not in compliance with our permits or certain environmental or land use laws and regulations in the future we may receive additional citations or notices we generally seek to work with the authorities to 12   resolve the issues raised by these citations or notices if we are not successful in these resolutions we may incur fines penalties or other sanctions that could result in material unanticipated costs or liabilities 

  the amount of insurance required to be maintained for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and therefore our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels we face the risk of incurring liabilities for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages   in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to environmental closure and postclosure liabilities we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds or rely on insurance including captive insurance we currently have in place all necessary financial assurance instruments but are aware of recent decreases in the availability and increases in the cost of financial assurance we do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future however in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance these types of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain which could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

 

   stringent government regulations at the federal state provincial and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as    regulations also affect the siting design and closure of landfills and could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently future changes in these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial   in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land use the permits and approvals are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit operations 

 

   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development expansion projects and acquisitions we expense indirect acquisition costs as incurred such as executive salaries general corporate overhead public affairs and other corporate services our policy is to charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to any facility or operation that is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired any pending acquisition that is not consummated and any disposal site development or expansion project that is not completed or determined to be impaired the charge against earnings is reduced by any portion of the capitalized expenditures and advances that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise in 13   future periods we may be required to incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or due to other events that cause impairments depending on the magnitude any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and possibly our ability to meet the financial covenants in our credit arrangements which could negatively affect our liquidity 

 

   our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting in addition some state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard wastes at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities although such mandates are a useful tool to protect our environment these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy services 

 

   our operating revenues are usually lower in the winter months primarily because the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities usually increases in the spring and summer months and the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate usually decreases during the winter months our first and fourth quarter results of operations typically are adversely affected by these seasonal changes in addition particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of our operations 

 

   our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials including fibers aluminum and glass all of which are subject to significant price fluctuations the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are fibers including old corrugated cardboard “occ” and old newsprint “onp” we enter into commodity price derivatives in an effort to mitigate some of the variability in cash flows from the sales of fibers at floating prices in the past three years the yearoveryear changes in the quarterly average market prices for occ ranged from a decrease of as much as 66 to an increase of as much as 131 the same comparisons for onp have ranged from a decrease of as much as 48 to an increase of as much as 64 these fluctuations can affect future operating income and cash flows   additionally there may be significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energy related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery wastetoenergy and independent power production plant operations our landfill gas recovery and wastetoenergy operations generally enter into longterm sales agreements therefore market fluctuations do not have a significant effect on these operations in the shortterm however revenues from our independent power production plants can be effected by price fluctuations in the past two years the yearoveryear changes in the average quarterly electricity prices have ranged from increases of as much as 7 to decreases of as much as 39 

 

   we and some of our subsidiaries are also currently involved in civil litigation and governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these matters is uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include judgments against us or settlements either of which could require substantial payments by us adversely affecting our liquidity 

 

   we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry consists of large national waste management companies and local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with these 14   companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues and taxexempt financing are available to them also such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts 

 

   labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements we might have to wait through “cooling off” periods which are often followed by unioninitiated work stoppages including strikes depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions our operating expenses could increase significantly which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

   the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns and environmental concerns fuel is needed to run our collection and transfer trucks and any price escalations or reductions in the supply could increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have implemented a fuel surcharge to partially offset increased fuel costs however we are not always able to pass through all of the increased fuel costs due to the terms of certain customers’ contracts 

 

   we face risks related to general economic and market conditions including the potential impact of the status of the economy and interest rate fluctuations we also face risks related to other adverse external economic conditions such as the ability of our insurers to timely meet their commitments and the effect that significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may have on such ability any negative general economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

   we currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures acquisitions and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary additional financings however our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may at management’s discretion repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock in 2004 our board of directors also initiated a quarterly dividend which resulted in the declaration of an 01875 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2004 if our cash flows from operations are less than is currently expected or our capital expenditures or acquisitions increase we may elect to incur more indebtedness or decrease share repurchase activity however there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable terms in these circumstances we would likely use our revolving credit facilities to meet our cash needs   our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial ratios if our cash flows are less than expected our capital requirements are more than expected or we incur additional indebtedness we may not be in compliance with the ratios this would result in a default under our credit facilities if we were unable to obtain waivers or amendments to the credit facilities the lenders could choose to declare all outstanding 15   borrowings immediately due and payable which we may not be able to pay in full default under our credit agreements or unavailability of this capital source could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our borrowing and bonding needs 

 

   upon implementation of new information technology systems we may experience problems that could adversely affect or even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved 

 

   our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules including new accounting rules and interpretations could adversely affect our operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results in future periods 

 

   our principal executive offices are in houston texas where we lease approximately 400000 square feet under leases expiring at various times through 2010 we also have us fieldbased administrative offices in arizona illinois pennsylvania new hampshire and georgia and a fieldbased administrative office in ontario canada   our principal property and equipment consist of land primarily landfills and other disposal facilities transfer stations and bases for collection operations buildings and vehicles and equipment we own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations we have operations in each of the fifty states other than montana and wyoming we also have operations in the district of columbia puerto rico and throughout canada   at december 31 2003 of our 289 active landfills 247 were either owned or operated through lease agreements these sites occupy approximately 134900 acres of land including approximately 33500 permitted acres and approximately 6000 acres we consider to be probable expansion acreage for landfill use our remaining 42 landfills were operated through contractual agreements primarily with municipalities at december 31 2003 we operated 366 transfer stations 138 material recovery facilities and 16 secondary processing facilities we also owned or operated 17 wastetoenergy facilities and six independent power production plants as of december 31 2003   we believe that our vehicles equipment and operating properties are adequately maintained and adequate for our current operations however we expect to continue to make investments in additional equipment and property for expansion for replacement of assets and in connection with future acquisitions for more information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included within this report

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december 31 2003 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1 of this report under the section “factors influencing future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements” the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   we are in an industry that provides an essential service needed by nearly every business and person our success depends on our ability to focus on our core business operational excellence and financial strength and flexibility in 2003 we continued to build financial strength by meeting our goal of producing adjusted free cash flow in the range of 900 million to 1 billion free cash flow is not a financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles however we include it in our communications to stockholders because we believe that the amount of cash we produce from our nonfinancing activities that is available to us for such things as acquisitions share repurchases debt reductions and dividends is important in evaluating our performance including meeting our goal of providing value to our stockholders we compute free cash flow by taking the net cash that was provided by our operating activities subtracting capital expenditures and adding proceeds from our divestitures and other sales of assets free cash flow is then adjusted for certain cash flow activity that we consider unusual for the year in 2003 the net cash provided by our operating activities was approximately 19 billion we spent approximately 12 billion for capital expenditures after adding back the proceeds we received of approximately 74 million from divestitures of businesses and other asset sales our free cash flow was approximately 800 million we adjusted this amount to take into consideration the approximately 223 million net cash impact for the settlement of our stockholder class action settlement giving us approximately 102 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2003   to help us improve our business and operations we have developed branded initiatives like wasteroute and service machine as well as other initiatives to improve safety procurement operations cost control and sales although we made significant progress in 2003 we have much more to do in 2004 and beyond and our company is now better positioned to reap the benefits of the programs we have put in place   an integral part of our focus has been on internal or organic growth in 2003 internal revenue growth was 09 or 103 million as compared to 2002 the biggest driver in this increase was price and we continue to work on our pricing program however volumes declined as compared to the prior year due mostly to the loss of a large contract with the city of chicago early in the year offsetting some of our pricing achievement we believe some of our performance in 2003 was due to general economic factors although increased competition also played a part we cannot control the economy but we can compete and therefore we focused on customer churn rates and sales force effectiveness in 2003 we continued to hold our customer churn rate below 10 which we see as a benchmark for success and we maintained the same amount of new sales dollars in 2003 as compared to the prior year even with a smaller sales force moreover it is generally believed that the waste industry lags the economy by six to nine months consequently our sales force effectiveness program including our pricing strategy should result in greater internal revenue growth if the recent economic recovery continues in 2004 and beyond finally we also actively pursue strategic acquisitions in our nasw operations through acquisitions we increased our 2003 revenue by 334 million   to achieve our goal of operational excellence we have been working hard to seek operational and cost efficiencies in 2003 we further streamlined our operating infrastructure which resulted in the elimination of about 1300 employee positions and 470 contract workers for 2003 we saw cost savings from the reorganization in our selling general and administrative costs while at the same time growing our total revenues by 4 the reorganization changed the roles of our people in the field so that our operating sites are responsible for delivering service and operational excellence and the market areas are responsible for implementing strategy improving performance and ensuring profitability in their markets 20     when measured on an initiativebyinitiative basis which is the way we measure our goals internally we believe that our efforts on cost reductions and efficiency programs are paying off we have continued to decrease the maintenance cost per driver hour which is the primary performance metric for fleet maintenance we also are focusing on container maintenance and have created improvement plans and conducted test pilots to see where we can reduce costs additionally our focus on our safety program resulted in another yearoveryear decrease in recordable injuries and vehicle accidents although our per claim costs continued to rise offsetting the financial benefit of the reduced number of claims finally our wasteroute initiative reduced the number of routes we have and now we are looking for opportunities to further save on routerelated costs   our operating costs and expenses for 2003 do not show the level of improvement we believe we have made in our initiatives to cut overall costs this is due to an increase in those costs as a result of a recharacterization of expenses that had previously been classified as selling general and administrative costs increased costs of goods sold due to acquisitions of recycling businesses the implementation of sfas no 143 increased disposal costs at third party facilities and increased labor rates however we believe that we have the momentum necessary to continue all of our efforts and make progress in 2004 we also believe that we have our organizational structure and field based management at the appropriate size for the current economy as well as for business opportunities from an expanding economy 

 

   in preparing our financial statements we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain of the information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments as described below   landfills  — effective january 1 2003 our method of accounting for landfill closure and postclosure as well as landfill final capping changed as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations through december 31 2002 the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and postclosure obligations on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill this practice referred to as lifecycle accounting within the waste industry continues to be followed with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs as a result of the adoption of sfas no 143 future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 143   the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also estimate additional costs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 143 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on these liabilities related assets and results of operations   landfill costs  — we estimate the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity this includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events the total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs landfill liner construction costs operating construction costs and capitalized interest costs 21     final capping costs  — we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events they then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill   closure and postclosure costs  — we base our estimates for closure and postclosure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance and monitoring the estimates for landfill closure and postclosure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain   available airspace  — our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate based on height restrictions and other factors how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity   expansion airspace  — we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances first to include airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is probable using the following criteria    these criteria are initially evaluated by our fieldbased engineers accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits however our policy provides that based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill if these criteria are not met inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed in these circumstances inclusion must be approved through a landfillspecific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis of the 84 landfill sites with expansions at december 31 2003 25 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace approximately twothirds of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because legal community or other issues could impede the expansion process while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements which in many cases were due to statespecific permitting procedures when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace we also include the projected costs for development final capping and closure and postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill   after determining the costs at our landfills including final capping costs and closure and postclosure costs and the available and probable expansion airspace relating to such costs we then determine the per ton 22   rates that will be expensed we look at factors such as the waste stream geography and rate of compaction among others to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event for assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 

  it is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner the costs of the landfill including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion may be subject to impairment testing as described below lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher closure and postclosure rates and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace additionally if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately   environmental remediation liabilities  — under current laws and regulations we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business these costs include potentially responsible party “prp” investigation settlement certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation considering whether we were an owner operator transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site next we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed prps estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers internally developed estimates are based on    asset impairments  — our longlived assets including landfills and landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization however accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets rather than a single asset if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an actual thirdparty evaluation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 23     typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include    if any of these or other indicators occur we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment several of these indicators are beyond our control and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur additionally estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as described below   landfills  — there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry   goodwill  — we assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances such as those listed above that would indicate that more likely than not the book value of goodwill has been impaired 24   results of operations   the following table presents for the periods indicated the periodtoperiod change in dollars in millions and percentages for the various statement of operations line items  25     the following table presents for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that the various statement of operations line items bear to operating revenues  results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2003 

 

   our operating revenues in 2003 were 116 billion compared to 111 billion in 2002 and 113 billion in 2001 as shown below north american solid waste or nasw is our principal operation and is comprised of seven operating groups within north america along with our other nasw services the operations shown as “other” in the table below consisted of international waste management services and nonsolid waste services all of which were divested as of march 31 2002  26     our nasw operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection disposal transfer and recycling services some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semimonthly fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site recycling revenue which is generated by our recycling group as well as our five geographic operating groups generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements   the mix of nasw operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions    the following table provides details associated with the periodtoperiod change in nasw revenues dollars in millions along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes  price — base business 

 

   the increase in base business pricing is attributable to our collection transfer and wastetoenergy businesses with a significant increase in our residential collection operations certain of these price increases relate to additional costs and taxes that have been charged to our customers however the increase was partially offset by our landfill business where we experienced decreases in pricerelated revenue principally 27   due to our special waste landfill operations mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the southern and western portions of the united states 

 

   the revenue increase due to price in our base business was derived from our commercial and residential collection and transfer station operations however these increases were offset partially by decreased pricing in our landfill special waste operations price — commodity 

 

   the commodity price increases in 2003 were driven by the prices of onp and plastic commodities onp prices increased to an average of 69 per ton for 2003 as compared to an average of 67 per ton for 2002 plastic commodity prices have increased an average of 50 partially offsetting these increases is a decline in the price of occ which has declined to an average of 64 per ton in 2003 as compared to an average of 71 per ton in 2002 

 

   there were significant increases in commodity prices in 2002 as compared to 2001 most notably an increase in occ prices which increased to an average price of 71 per ton for 2002 as compared to an average price of 45 per ton for 2001 price — electricity and fuel 

 

   electricity rates remained relatively flat in 2003 as compared to 2002 however we experienced positive price increases due to increased fuel surcharges billed to customers as a result of higher fuel costs 

 

   reduced electricity rates and fuel surcharges negatively impacted the price related revenue change in 2002 as compared to the prior year volume 

 

   the decrease in revenue due to volumes was primarily in our collection and recycling businesses we believe the 2003 declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition particularly in the eastern and midwestern portions of the united states our loss of a contract with the city of chicago during february 2003 was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling accounting for lost revenues of approximately 60 million for the year ended december 31 2003 partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills primarily in the southern and western portions of the united states 

 

   the volume decline in 2002 as compared to 2001 largely related to commercial and industrial collection services throughout our operations with the exception of the southern portion of the united states where we realized slight volume increases we also experienced declines in disposal revenue due to volume primarily in the eastern and western portions of the united states we believe that the overall decreased volumes particularly in the higher margin commercial and industrial collection services were attributable to the lagging economy and increased competition however the declines were offset by increased volumes in our recycling operations of 19 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 28   acquisitions and divestitures 

 

   in connection with our formation of recycle america alliance in january 2003 we acquired the peltz group the largest privatelyheld recycler in the united states we also acquired several collection businesses that complemented and enhanced our existing collection network these increases were partially offset by divestitures of low margin operations 

 

   revenue in 2002 increased due to a number of individually small acquisitions consummated during 2002 and the full year effect of acquisitions completed in 2001 the increases due to acquisitions were partially offset by 2002 divestitures foreign currency translation 

 

   fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar favorably affected revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 

 

   fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar negatively affected revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 

 

   our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits risks management costs fuel facility operating costs maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations and accretion of and expense revisions relating to future landfill capping closure and postclosure costs and environmental remediation certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed and include acquisition engineering upgrading construction capitalized interest and permitting costs additionally we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial defense and tort claim costs such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses   for the year ended december 31 2003 operating costs and expenses were 637 million higher than the prior year period representing an increase of 93 as a percentage of operating revenue operating costs and expenses were 649 for the year ended december 31 2003 which is a 32 percentage point increase from the prior year period the increase was generally due to  29      business acquisitions accounted for approximately 286 million of the increases discussed above   for the year ended december 31 2002 operating costs and expenses were 214 million higher than the prior year period representing an increase of 32 as a percentage of operating revenue operating costs and expenses were 617 for the year ended december 31 2002 which is a 28 percentage point increase from the prior year period the increase was generally due to    these increases in operating costs and expenses were offset by headcount reductions as a result of the march 2002 reorganization and divestitures of our international operations in 2001 and the nonsolid waste operations in the first quarter of 2002 

 

   our selling general and administrative expenses include management salaries clerical and administrative costs marketing costs professional services facility rentals provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs as well as costs related to our sales force and customer service 30     for the year ended december 31 2003 selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 176 million or 126 as compared to the prior year as a percentage of revenue the decrease was 20 percentage points from 125 for the year ended december 31 2002 to 105 for the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was generally due to    the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to    these reductions were offset partially by increased costs associated with litigation settlements higher bad debt expense largely attributable to the weaker economy workers compensation costs and propertyrelated costs such as property taxes maintenance and security 

 

   depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of intangible assets with a definite life primarily on a straightline basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements generally from 3 to 7 years ii depreciation of property and equipment on a straightline basis from 3 to 50 years iii amortization of landfill costs including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development construction closure and postclosure on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site and iv as a result of our adoption of sfas no 143 amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a unitsofconsumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event   as a percentage of operating revenues depreciation and amortization expense was 109 in 2003 110 in 2002 and 121 in 2001 depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003 even after considering the effect of the accounting changes that resulted from our adoption of sfas no 143   the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2002 is primarily attributable to our adoption of sfas no 142 which required that the amortization of all goodwill cease on january 1 2002 goodwill amortization for 2001 was 156 million or 14 of operating revenues excluding the effect of goodwill amortization expense in 2001 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased 03 from 2001 to 2002 the following schedule reflects the 2001 adjusted net income excluding goodwill 31   and negative goodwill amortization as compared to the results of operations for december 31 2002 and 2003 in millions except per share amounts 

 

 

   in 2002 we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic groups to better align collection transport recycling and disposal resources as part of the restructuring we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately 1900 fieldlevel administrative and operational positions in 2002 we recorded 38 million in pretax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure these charges included 36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and 2 million related to abandoned operating lease agreements   in february 2003 we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating groups to 66 from 91 at december 31 2002 and reduced certain overhead positions to further streamline our organization management believes that this structure results in a more effective utilization of resources and enables us to serve our customers more efficiently in connection with these restructuring efforts we reduced our workforce by about 700 employees and 270 contract workers we recorded 20 million of pretax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure all of which was associated with employee severance and benefit costs   the operational efficiencies provided by these organizational changes and a focus on fully utilizing the capabilities of our information technology resources enabled us to further reduce our workforce in june 2003 this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of 600 employee positions and 200 contract worker positions we recorded 24 million of pretax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction   as of december 31 2003 approximately 11 million remains accrued for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of these workforce reductions our obligations for the accrued severance payments continue through the third quarter of 2005 

 

   during 2003 we recorded a net gain of 8 million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of 13 million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset in part by 5 million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges   in 2002 the net gain for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to i our receipt of approximately 11 million related to a previously impaired nonrevenue producing asset ii net gains of 32   approximately 8 million on divestitures during the year and iii reductions to legal reserves of approximately 8 million and loss contract reserves of approximately 7 million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items 

  in 2001 the expense was comprised mainly of a charge of 374 million which is net of the recovery from our insurers and the stockholders derivative suit against our former independent public accountant arthur andersen llp for the settlement reached in connection with the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in july 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities laws the final net cash settlement payment of 377 million which is the amount provided by the settlement agreement plus accrued interest less our recoveries was made in the third quarter of 2003 additionally in 2001 we recorded a heldforsale adjustment of approximately 15 million related to our international operations along with a heldforsale adjustment for an investment in mexican solid waste operations of approximately 28 million offsetting these expenses was a net gain of 24 million comprised of the reversal of the heldforsale impairment of 109 million and a heldforuse impairment of 85 million from our decision during the third quarter of 2001 not to sell all but one of our independent power production plants and the reclassification in the third quarter of 2001 of all but one of those plants from heldforsale to heldforuse also included in asset impairments and unusual items for 2001 were reversals of certain loss contract reserves of 13 million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements 

 

   our interest expense decreased consistently each year from 2001 to 2003 the decrease in interest expense is partially attributable to our increased utilization of taxexempt financing which has resulted in a decline in our weighted average interest rate the remaining decrease in interest expense from 2001 to 2003 is attributable to the overall positive impact of our interest rate derivative contracts which are used to manage our interest rate exposure and the general decline in interest rates interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by 90 million in 2003 86 million in 2002 and 39 million in 2001 

 

   we experienced a significant impact to other income in 2002 as compared to other years due primarily to the sale of an equity investment in 2002 a company in which we held an approximately 17 interest was acquired by another entity we also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition the proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 

 

   we recorded a provision for income taxes of 404 million for 2003 422 million for 2002 and 283 million for 2001 resulting in an effective income tax rate of 360 340 and 361 for each of the three years respectively see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion   the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes offset in part by nonconventional fuel tax credits additionally in 2003 we recognized a 6 million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits in 2002 we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture a tax benefit of approximately 31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carryback of losses by our dutch subsidiary   the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2001 is primarily due to state and local income taxes nondeductible costs associated with the impairment of certain businesses the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested offset in part by nonconventional fuel tax credits additionally in 2001 scheduled canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of 42 million which was 33   offset in part by a tax expense of 24 million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in canada 

 

   in the first and fourth quarters of 2003 we recorded net of tax charges of 46 million and 43 million respectively to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below    in the first quarter of 2002 we recorded a credit of 2 million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to writeoff the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 141 accounting for business combinations   in the first quarter of 2001 adoption of sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities resulted in a gain net of tax of approximately 2 million 

 

   we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern midwest southern western canadian wheelabrator and recycling groups these groups when combined with certain other operations comprise our north american solid waste or nasw operations the operations not managed through our seven operating groups are presented herein as “other nasw” 34     as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements our restructuring and workforce reductions have impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in 2003 and 2002 the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments’ operating results in millions  

 

 liquidity and capital resources   the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in millions    cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less   we generated cash flows from operations of approximately 19 billion in 2003 which included approximately 109 million received for the fair value of interest rate swap agreements terminated prior to their scheduled maturities also included as a component of 2003 cash flows from operations is a net cash 35   outflow of approximately 223 million associated with the final settlement of our securities class action lawsuit which occurred during the third quarter settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during the year includes i a final net cash settlement payment of approximately 377 million associated with the settlement agreement of a shareholder class action suit plus accrued interest ii utilization of insurance proceeds of approximately 87 million to settle the remaining portion of the settlement iii a total tax benefit of approximately 138 million of which we realized 66 million in the second quarter and 36 million in each of the third and fourth quarters and iv related net settlement recoveries of approximately 16 million 

  during 2003 we used 11 billion for investing activities consisting of 12 billion for capital expenditures and 337 million for the acquisition of businesses net of cash acquired which were offset by net receipts of 371 million from restricted funds and proceeds from divestitures of businesses net of cash divested and other asset sales and other items of 82 million additionally we used 10 billion for financing activities which consisted primarily of the repurchase of shares of our common stock for 550 million and net debt reductions of 456 million   our cash balances decreased by 466 million from december 31 2001 to december 31 2002 this decrease is primarily attributable to capital expenditures our stock repurchase program and the repayment of portions of our senior note issuances prior to their maturity dates   in 2002 cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by 166 million for cash received from counterparties for certain interest rate swap agreements that we terminated prior to the scheduled maturities offset by cash paid of 66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances included in our investing activities was cash paid of 13 billion for capital expenditures and 162 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses these expenditures were offset by proceeds of 487 million from other investing activities primarily proceeds from sales of assets and net cash receipts from restricted funds included in our financing activities was cash paid of 982 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in addition we paid 697 million for net debt reductions and received 27 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants   in 2001 we generated cash flows from operations of approximately 24 billion favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of 59 million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and 64 million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities included in our investing activities was 13 billion of capital expenditures and 116 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses these expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of 212 million in addition we used 485 million for financing activities which is comprised of 510 million of net debt reductions and 25 million of other financing activities offset by proceeds of 50 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants   we operate in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations in the past we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive based on several key factors we believe considered by credit rating agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future these factors include    in addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations we have capital requirements for i capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites as well as new trucks and equipment 36   for collection and other operations ii refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy facilities and iii business acquisitions for 2004 we currently expect to spend approximately 115 billion to 125 billion for capital expenditures and approximately 250 million for acquisitions 

  in february 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program for up to 1 billion in annual repurchases for each year through 2004 to be implemented at management’s discretion share repurchases in 2003 were less than the 1 billion allowed because we used funds that would have otherwise been available for this program to settle our securities class action lawsuit and for our acquisition program we expect to utilize cash flows from operations for purchases made in either open market or privately negotiated transactions   the following is a summary of activity to date for our stock repurchase program in millions except shares in thousands and price per share in dollars  

 

   in august 2003 we announced that the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend program beginning in 2004 it is expected that the dividend will be 01875 per share per quarter or 075 per share annually the first quarterly dividend of 01875 per share will be paid on march 25 2004 to stockholders of record as of march 1 2004 our 2004 dividend payments are expected to result in a cash outlay of approximately 430 million 37     the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions  

 

   we have contingencies that are deemed not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion   our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations however we also have bank borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and when appropriate will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock   as of december 31 2003 we had a threeyear 650 million syndicated revolving credit facility and a fiveyear 175 billion syndicated revolving credit facility the threeyear revolver matures in june 2005 and the fiveyear revolver matures in june 2006 at december 31 2003 no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had unused and available credit capacity under these facilities of approximately 792 million   as of december 31 2003 we are required to maintain the following financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities i an interest coverage ratio ii total debt to ebitda ratio and iii minimum net worth all as defined in the credit facilities solely for the purpose of determining compliance with the 38   covenants the interest coverage ratio requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of a our consolidated net income plus interest expense and income taxes “ebit” for the four fiscal quarters then ending to b consolidated total interest expense for such period to be less than 3 to 1 the total debt to ebitda covenant requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of a all indebtedness and certain contingent liabilities such as financial guarantees to b ebit plus depreciation and amortization expense “ebitda” for the four fiscal quarters then ending to exceed 325 to 1 our minimum net worth covenant restricts us from allowing stockholders’ equity to be less than 35 billion plus 75 of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter beginning with the first fiscal quarter ended march 31 2001 the credit facilities requiring compliance with these financial covenants state that the calculations must be based on generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by the financial accounting standards board and applied by us during the latest fiscal year before the date of the facilities or december 31 2000 and 2001 therefore our adoption or implementation of accounting pronouncements or interpretations effective after those dates does not impact the calculation of the financial covenants defined above we are in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facilities and all other debt instruments 

  we have increased our utilization of taxexempt financing and plan to continue this trend due to the attractive rates offered for these instruments as such we continue to assess our financial assurance and letter of credit requirements and expect that we will arrange additional longterm letter of credit andor surety bond capacity in advance of our business requirements   we have issued taxexempt bonds primarily for the construction of collection and disposal facilities proceeds from these financing arrangements are directly deposited into trust funds and we do not have the ability to utilize the funds in regular operating activities accordingly we report these amounts as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust funds and a financing activity when the industrial revenue bonds are repaid at december 31 2003 approximately 465 million of funds were held in trust to meet future capital expenditures at various facilities these fund balances are included as other longterm assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets historically proceeds from the issuance of taxexempt bonds held in trust funds have been invested in cash and cash equivalents beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003 we determined that it would be beneficial to invest these funds in longer term higher yield debt instruments as of december 31 2003 397 million of our trust fund assets funded by taxexempt bonds and held for future capital expenditures were invested in us government agency debt securities with maturities ranging from less than one year to three years   we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt which was approximately 63 fixed and 37 floating at december 31 2003 in addition we use variable rate taxexempt financings and periodically enter into derivative transactions to secure the thencurrent market interest rate in anticipation of senior debt issuances offbalance sheet arrangements   we are party to i lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements ii product and service purchase commitments as discussed in the other longterm commitments section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and iii guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements these lease agreements and purchase commitments are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities products and services at competitive marketdriven prices our thirdparty guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position results of operations or liquidity during the period ended december 31 2003 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity 39   seasonal trends and inflation   our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months primarily due to the lower volume of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to decrease during the winter months our first and fourth quarter results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends we also use the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our wastetoenergy facilities so repair and maintenance expense is generally higher in our first quarter than in other quarters during the year in addition particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of our operations   we believe that inflation has not had and in the near future is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations however management’s estimates associated with inflation have had and will continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental liabilities new accounting pronouncements   information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

   in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency rates and certain commodity prices from time to time we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2003 all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions with the exception of certain derivatives related to the fiber commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our derivative counterparties however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider creditworthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance   we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements   interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are denominated in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest rates to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations an instantaneous one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at both december 31 2003 and 2002 by approximately 500 million this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity   we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately 752 million of restricted funds held in trust funds and escrow accounts included as a component of other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet these funds are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure postclosure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities because of the shortterms of these investments we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 40     currency rate exposure from time to time we have used foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany foreigncurrency denominated debt there would be no material impact if there were an instantaneous 10 decrease in foreign exchange rates at either december 31 2003 or december 31 2002   commodities price exposure we market recycled waste paper products such as onp and occ from our material recovery facilities we enter into financial fiber swaps to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales under these swap agreements we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time we record changes in the fair value of these fiber swap agreements not designated as hedges immediately to earnings all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used and our risk exposure limits an instantaneous 10 increase in occ and onp prices would decrease the fair value of our hedges by approximately 10 million on both december 31 2003 and 2002 this analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity sales positions that are being hedged   see notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments 41

     our principal executive offices are in houston texas where we lease
approximately 400000 square feet under leasing arrangements expiring at various
times through 2010 we also have us fieldbased administrative offices in
arizona illinois pennsylvania new hampshire and georgia and a fieldbased
administrative office in ontario canada

     our principal property and equipment consist of land primarily landfills
and other disposal facilities transfer stations and bases for collection
operations buildings and vehicles and equipment we own or lease real
property in most locations where we have operations we have operations in each
of the fifty states other than montana and wyoming we also have operations in
the district of columbia puerto rico and throughout canada

     at december 31 2002 of our 293 active landfills 246 were either owned or
operated through lease agreements these sites occupy approximately 131000
acres of land including approximately 33000 permitted acres and approximately
5900 acres we consider to be probable expansion acreage for landfill use our
remaining 47 landfills were operated through contractual agreements primarily
with municipalities at december 31 2002 we operated 346 transfer stations
146 mrfs and 18 secondary processing facilities we also owned or operated
through agreements 16 wastetoenergy facilities and eight ipps as of december
31 2002

     we believe that our vehicles equipment and operating properties are
adequately maintained and adequate for our current operations however we
expect to continue to make investments in additional equipment and property for
expansion for replacement of assets and in connection with future

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

     below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december
31 2002 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate
results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss
in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from
expectations in item 1 of this report under the section factors influencing
future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements this discussion
should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated
financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements

  critical accounting estimates and assumptions

     in preparing our financial statements we make several estimates and
assumptions that affect our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses we
must make these estimates and assumptions because certain of the information
that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on
future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from
available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on
generally accepted methodologies in some cases these estimates are
particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment
the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that
deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty are related to our accounting for
landfills environmental liabilities and asset impairments as described below

     the discussion below details our accounting policies for landfills through
december 31 2002 as of january 1 2003 our practice will change upon adoption
of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 143 accounting for
asset retirement obligations sfas no 143 see note 25 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information

     accounting for landfills  we utilize the life cycle method of accounting
for landfill costs and the units of consumption method to amortize landfill
construction costs and record closure and postclosure obligations over the
estimated remaining useful life of a landfill under this method we include
future estimated construction costs as well as costs incurred to date in the
amortization base additionally we include probable expansion airspace that has
yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the
landfill this accounting method requires us to make estimates and assumptions
as described below any changes in our estimates will impact our income from
operations prospectively from the date the changes are made

     landfill costs  we assess the total cost to develop each landfill site to
its final capacity this includes certain projected landfill costs that are
uncertain because they are dependent on future events the total cost to develop
a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and
capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future
purchase and development costs landfill final capping costs liner construction
costs operating construction costs and capitalized interest costs

     while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with
certainty we expect to incur 73 billion during the remaining operating lives
of the landfills the future costs will be capitalized as incurred and expensed
over the useful lives of the landfills as airspace is consumed

     closure and postclosure costs  the costs for closure and postclosure
obligations at landfills we own or operate are estimated based on our
interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory
changes the estimates for landfill final closure and postclosure costs also
consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in where appropriate
inflation and discount rates the possibility of changing legal and regulatory
requirements and the forwardlooking nature of these types of costs make any
estimation or assumption uncertain

     while the precise amount of future closure and postclosure costs cannot be
determined with certainty we estimate that the aggregate cost of landfill
closure and postclosure as of december 31 2002 is approximately 26 billion

     available airspace  our engineers determine the useful life at our
landfills by estimating the available airspace this is done by using surveys
and other methods to calculate based on height restrictions and other

                                        19
page

factors how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of
at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity

     expansion airspace  we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our
estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances first to include
airspace associated with an expansion effort we must generally expect the
expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the expansion
permit to be received within five years second we must believe the success of
obtaining the expansion permit is probable using the following criteria

      personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local and state
       approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill

      at the time the expansion is added to the permitted site life it is
       probable that the approvals will be received within the normal
       application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction
       in which the landfill is located

      either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or
       obtain land to be included in the expansion plan

      there are no significant known technical legal community business or
       political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of
       such expansion

      financial analysis has been completed and the results demonstrate that
       the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact and

      airspace and related costs including additional closure and postclosure
       costs have been estimated based on conceptual design

     these criteria are initially evaluated by our fieldbased engineers
accountants managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining
the permits however our policy provides that based on the facts and
circumstances of a specific landfill if these criteria are not met inclusion
of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed in these circumstances inclusion
must be approved through a landfillspecific process that includes approval of
the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of
directors on a quarterly basis of the 91 landfill sites with expansions at
december 31 2002 26 landfills required the chief financial officer to approve
the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace approximately twothirds of these
landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because of legal or
community issues that could impede the expansion process while the remaining
were primarily due to permit application processes beyond the oneyear limit
which in most cases were due to statespecific permitting procedures when we
include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace we
also include the projected costs for development final capping and closure and
postclosure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill

     it is possible that any of our estimates or assumptions could ultimately
turn out to be significantly different from actual results in some cases we may
be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an
expansion permit that we previously thought was probable has become unlikely to
the extent that such estimates or the assumptions used to make those estimates
prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we
will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner the
costs of the landfill including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the
expansion may be subject to impairment testing as described below and lower
profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher
closure and postclosure rates and higher expenses or asset impairments related
to the removal of previously included expansion airspace

     after determining the costs at our landfills including closure and
postclosure costs and the available and probable expansion airspace we then
determine the per ton rate that will be expensed we look at factors such as the
waste stream geography and rate of compaction among others to determine the
number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace
we then divide our costs by that number of tons giving us the rate per ton to
expense

                                        20
page

     the average landfill airspace amortization cost per ton for the 293
landfills operating at december 31 2002 was 357 per ton as compared to 370
for the 302 landfills at december 31 2001 as of december 31 2002 and 2001
the net book value recorded for capitalized landfill site costs was 51 billion
and 50 billion respectively

     the average landfill closure and postclosure expense on a per ton basis
for the 293 landfills operating at december 31 2002 was 023 per ton as
compared to 024 for the 302 landfills at december 31 2001 as of december 31
2002 and 2001 we had recorded landfill closure and postclosure liabilities of
655 million and 625 million respectively

     environmental remediation liabilities  under current laws and
regulations we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our
operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a
particular site remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any
identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected
in the normal course of business these costs include legal defense potentially
responsible party prp investigation settlement and consultant fees as
well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as
materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we
estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on
sitespecific facts and circumstances we routinely review and evaluate sites
that require remediation including sites listed on the epas national
priorities list npl sites we consider whether we were an owner operator
transporter or generator at the site the amount and type of waste hauled to
the site and the number of years we were connected with the site next we
review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed prps we
then estimate the cost for the likely remedy which is based on

      managements judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated
       parties sites

      information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
       remediation

      the number financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of
       other prps who may be liable for remediation of a specific site and

      the typical allocation of costs among prps

     these estimates are sometimes a range of reasonably possible outcomes in
those cases we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best
estimate if no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any
other we use the amounts that are the low ends of such ranges in accordance
with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies sfas no 5 and its
interpretations were we to use the high ends of such ranges our potential
liability would be approximately 220 million higher on a discounted basis in
the aggregate than the estimate recorded in the consolidated financial
statements as of december 31 2002 as used in this context reasonably
possible means we believe it is more than remote but less than likely as of
december 31 2002 and 2001 we had recorded liabilities of 343 million and 321
million respectively for the present value of remediation costs for our sites

     asset impairments  our longlived assets including landfills and
landfill expansions are carried on our financial statements based on their cost
less accumulated depreciation or amortization however accounting standards
require us to writedown these assets if they become impaired if significant
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the
carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future
cash flows if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future
cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset
to its carrying value fair value is determined by either an actual thirdparty
evaluation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of
the asset cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets
rather than a single asset if cash flows cannot be separately and independently
identified for a single asset we will determine whether an impairment has
occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash
flows if the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying
amount of the asset or asset group an impairment in the amount of the
difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs

                                        21

     typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include

      a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group

      a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or
       asset group is being used or in its physical condition

      a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate
       that could affect the value of an asset or asset group including an
       adverse action or assessment by a regulator

      an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally
       expected for the acquisition or construction of a longlived asset

      current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of
       operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that
       demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived
       asset or asset group or

      a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or
       asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before
       the end of its previously estimated useful life

     if any of these or other indicators occur we review the asset to determine
whether there has been an impairment several of these indicators are beyond our
control and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will
occur additionally estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment
and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there are
additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill as
described below

     landfills  there are certain indicators listed above that require
significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to
landfill development or expansion projects for example a regulator may
initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion
permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert
waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill
airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of
business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the
unique nature of the waste industry

     goodwill  we assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis upon
determining the existence of goodwill impairment we measure that impairment
based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair
value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair
value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair
value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been
acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated additional
impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter
events or changes in circumstances such as those listed above that would
indicate that more likely than not the book value of goodwill has been
impaired

results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2002

  operating revenues

     our operating revenues in 2002 were 111 billion compared to 113
billion in 2001 and 125 billion in 2000 our revenues decreased from 2000 to
2001 primarily because we sold our international operations most of our
nonsolid waste businesses and certain nonintegrated nasw operations as shown
below nasw is our principal operation which is comprised of six operating
groups within north america along with our other nasw services our other
operations consisted of waste management services in international markets and
nonsolid waste services all of which were divested as of march 31 2002

     our nasw operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
collection disposal and transfer station services some of the fees we charge
to our customers for collection services are billed in advance a liability for
future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are
recognized as services are actually provided revenues from our disposal
operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume
and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally
billed monthly or semimonthly fees charged at transfer stations are based on
the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading
transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site intercompany
revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements

     nasw revenues decreased by 28 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 we
experienced negative internal growth in our nasw operations of 09 or 92
million which was substantially volume related the negative volume decline of
16 or 174 million compared to 2001 is largely related to commercial and
industrial collection services throughout our operations with the exception of
the southern portion of the united states where we realized slight volume
increases we also experienced declines in disposal revenue due to volume
primarily in the eastern and western portions of the united states we believe
that the overall decreased volumes particularly in the higher margin commercial
and industrial collection services were attributable to the lagging economy and
increased competition however offsetting these declines were increases in
volumes related to our recycling operations of 19 million in 2002 as compared
to 2001

     offsetting the decrease in revenue due to volume declines were price
related revenue increases of 82 million or 07 in 2002 as compared to 2001
of this increase 69 million or 06 is attributable to the significant
increase in commodity prices of occ and onp occ prices increased to an average
price of 74 per ton for 2002 as compared to an average price of 49 per ton for
2001 reduced electricity rates in california and reduced fuel surcharges
negatively impacted the price related revenue change by 59 million or 05 
revenue change due to price in our base business reflected an increase of 72
million or 06 was derived from our commercial and residential collection and
transfer station operations these price related revenue increases were offset
partially by decreased pricing in our landfill special waste operations

     we also experienced increases in revenue of 82 million in 2002 from
acquisitions consummated during 2002 and the full year effect of acquisitions
completed in 2001 offsetting this was a decrease in revenue of 18 million due
to divestitures and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations related to the
canadian dollar

     nasw revenues decreased from 2000 to 2001 by 260 million due primarily to
divestitures of our nonintegrated nasw operations during 2000 we also
experienced a reduction of revenue due to volume of 86 million largely
attributable to the overall slowing of the north american economy the
termination of unprofitable accounts and the impact of our policy change for
third party brokers which required more stringent contract requirements
resulting in the loss of some brokered waste nasw operating revenues also
declined because of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the
canadian dollar which reduced revenues by 20 million in addition revenue
changes due to price reflected a decline of 8 million due to combined revenue
declines of 171 million from recycling commodities and electricity sales by
ipps substantially offset by increased revenues due to price in the base
business of 162 million offsetting these revenue declines were the acquisition
of certain nasw operations in 2001 and the yearoveryear effect of acquisitions
of nasw operations in 2000

  operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown
  below

     our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and
related taxes and benefits fuel maintenance and repairs of equipment and
facilities tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer
stations and accruals for future landfill closure and postclosure costs and
environmental remediation certain direct landfill development expenditures are
capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity
is consumed and include acquisition engineering upgrading construction
capitalized interest and permitting costs additionally we sometimes receive
reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related
remedial defense and tort claim costs such recoveries are included in
operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses our
operating costs and expenses increased 12 in 2002 as compared to 2001 and
decreased 116 in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a percentage of operating
revenues operating costs and expenses decreased from 604 in 2000 to 589 in
2001 and increased to 605 in 2002

     the most significant factor causing the change in operating expenses
between 2002 and 2001 was the offset to operating costs and expenses of
approximately 105 million recorded in 2001 for the recovery of claims against
insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses operating expenses were
also higher in 2002 as compared to 2001 because of i increases in salary
wages and employee benefit costs ii higher workers compensation costs iii
increases in disposal and subcontractor costs and iv higher costs associated
with recycling commodities

     the headcount reductions associated with our march 2002 reorganization
allowed us to realize significant cost reductions however the reorganization
also resulted in a recharacterization of certain costs that were reported as
selling general and administrative expenses in prior periods due to changes in
certain roles and responsibilities this change along with additional costs
associated with annual merit increases more than offset the decrease in
operating expenses as a result of the headcount reductions

     disposal cost increases were primarily related to increased taxes on the
disposal of waste in pennsylvania which were partially offset by decreases in
disposal costs due to declines in volumes in 2002 as compared with 2001
subcontractor cost increases included increased utilization of subcontractors
for certain of our national account customers in areas where services are not
provided by us and increased use of third party transportation of waste to
disposal facilities the increased costs associated with recycling commodities
were due primarily to an increase in market prices paid for occ and onp which
resulted in increased rebates paid to customers

     offsetting these increases was the effect of divestitures of our
international operations in 2001 and the nonsolid waste operations in the first
quarter of 2002 the divestitures decreased operating expenses by approximately
115 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 also offsetting the increased costs
and expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001 were lower fuel costs including fuel
used to operate our ipps reduced maintenance costs and lower construction
services at certain of our wastetoenergy facilities that we operate but do not
own

     the yeartoyear decline in operating costs and expenses between 2000 and
2001 was primarily caused by the sales of our international nonsolid waste and
nonintegrated nasw operations these sales occurred throughout 2000 and into
2001 adding to the decrease was the effect of the volume declines in 2001 as
compared to 2000 as described in the discussion of nasw operating revenues
additionally in 2000 we initiated cost saving improvements in our procurement
practices and began to develop more standardized operating procedures our
improvements continued in 2001 and caused further decreases in operating costs
and expenses into 2001 in 2001 we implemented other cost saving initiatives
such as preventative maintenance programs that created an overall reduction in
repair and maintenance costs finally in 2001 we aggressively pursued our
claims against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses recovering
approximately 105 million in 2001 as compared to 2 million in 2000 which were
recorded as an offset to operating costs and expenses if we excluded the
insurance recoveries operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues
would have been 598 in 2001

  selling general and administrative expenses

     our selling general and administrative expenses include management
salaries clerical and administrative costs marketing costs professional
services facility rentals provision for doubtful accounts and related
insurance costs as well as costs related to our sales force and customer
service

     our selling general and administrative expenses decreased 93 million or
57 in 2002 as compared to 2001 and decreased 116 million or 67 in 2001
compared to 2000 as a percentage of operating revenues our selling general
and administrative expenses were 137 for 2002 143 for 2001 and 139 for
2000

     the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in 2002 as
compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to managements focus on reducing
spending related to professional fees travel and entertainment and other
administrative costs additionally expenses decreased due to headcount
reductions and the recharacterization of certain expenses as costs of
operations rather than selling general and administrative expenses as a result
of the march 2002 restructuring finally costs further decreased due to the
divestitures of nonsolid waste and international operations in 2001 and in
early 2002

     the reductions in selling general and administrative expenses were offset
partially by increased costs associated with both litigation settlements and
expense higher bad debt expense largely attributable to the weaker economy
workers compensation costs and propertyrelated costs such as property taxes
maintenance and security selling general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of operating revenues decreased in 2002 as compared with 2001 because
of these same factors since operating revenues remained essentially flat
between the two periods

     the increase in selling general and administrative costs as a percentage
of revenues from 2000 to 2001 is due to the decrease in nasw revenues in the
corresponding periods as discussed above however the decrease in actual
selling general and administrative expenses from 2001 as compared to 2000 is
due mostly to the divestitures that we completed throughout 2000 in addition
as discussed below we had significant costs in 2000 related to accounting and
process improvement initiatives these costs were not as significant in 2001 as
we were able to stabilize our accounting systems and substantially complete our
process improvement initiatives in the second half of 2000 offsetting these
decreases were costs related to corporate staffing increases which began
primarily in 2000 and continued in 2001

     in 2000 we incurred significant costs for our process improvement
initiatives and accounting assistance these costs were mainly in the first half
of 2000 because by the second half of 2000 we had stabilized our accounting
systems and completed our process improvement initiatives which significantly
reduced our ongoing need for these services in 2000 we incurred approximately
196 million for professional accounting and process improvement consulting
services and consulting services related to the implementation of new enterprise
information systems we also incurred approximately 51 million related to our
divestitures improvements to our billing systems and verification of our
customer base and legal fees related to certain stockholder litigation and
other sec matters however in 2000 we were successful in collecting certain
accounts that were reserved for in 1999 favorably impacting our provision for
bad debt in 2000

  depreciation and amortization

     depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of intangible
assets with a definite life other than goodwill on a straightline basis
generally 3 to 7 years or over the definitive terms of the related agreements
ii depreciation of property and equipment on a straightline basis from 3 to
50 years and iii amortization of landfill costs on a unitsofconsumption
method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of
a site in 2001 and 2000 depreciation and amortization expense also included
the amortization of goodwill on a straightline basis over a period of 40 years
or less commencing on the dates of the respective acquisition

     depreciation and amortization expense decreased 109 in 2002 as compared
to 2001 and decreased 41 in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a percentage of
operating revenues depreciation and amortization expense was 110 in 2002
121 in 2001 and 114 in 2000

                                        28
page

     the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2002 is primarily
attributable to our adoption of sfas no 142 which required that the
amortization of all goodwill cease on january 1 2002 goodwill amortization for
2001 was 156 million or 14 of operating revenues excluding the effect of
goodwill amortization expense in 2001 depreciation and amortization expense as
a percentage of revenues increased 03 from 2001 compared to 2002

     the decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2001 is attributable to
the amortization expense of goodwill on operations that were divested throughout
2000 more costeffective use of our landfill assets in 2001 and a temporary
increase in fully depreciated trucks and other equipment associated with delays
in receiving new equipment in the first half of 2001

  restructuring

     in 2002 we adopted and implemented a new organizational structure to
better align collection transport recycling and disposal resources within
market areas we believe the new structure will yield a number of benefits
including clearer accountability and responsibility for business performance and
profitability in specific markets simplification of structure cost savings
through consolidation of duplicate administrative and other support functions
improved utilization of operating assets and better customer responsiveness

     in march 2002 all of our operations other than wti and cws were
restructured to reduce the number of field layers of management from four to
three and the number of field layers that have administrative staff from four to
two under the new structure our approximately 1200 operating sites including
waste collection depots transfer stations landfills and recycling facilities
were restructured into approximately 82 newly established market areas these
market areas all report to one of four groups that divide the united states
geographically into the eastern midwest southern and western operations and
which were formerly known as our areas cws which was restructured into ten
newly established market areas in july 2002 and wti were the fifth and sixth
areas under our previous structure continue as the fifth and sixth groups under
the new structure

     we recorded 38 million of pretax charges for costs associated with the
implementation of the new organizational structure these charges include 36
million for employee severance and benefit costs and 2 related to abandoned
operating lease agreements

                                        29
page

     under the new structure approximately 1900 fieldlevel administrative and
operational positions have been eliminated our obligation for severance
payments will continue into 2003 as of december 31 2002 payments of 33
million for employee severance and benefits and for abandoned leases had been
recorded against the restructuring liability that was previously established

  asset impairments and unusual items

     in 2002 the net gain for asset impairments and unusual items was due
primarily to i our receipt of approximately 11 million related to a
nonrevenue producing asset written down as an asset impairment in 1998 ii
net gains of approximately 8 million on divestitures during the year and iii
reductions to legal and loss contract reserves of approximately 8 million and
7 million respectively that we deemed were in excess of current requirements
and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual
items

     in 2001 the expense was comprised mainly of a charge of 374 million
which is net of the recovery from our insurers and the stockholders derivative
suit against our former independent public accountant arthur andersen llp for
the settlement reached in connection with the stockholder class action lawsuit
filed against us in july 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities
laws the settlement which is subject to court approval provides for our
payment to the class of 457 million and we believe the payment which is
expected to be made in 2003 will result in a net cash outflow of approximately
230 to 240 million after considering insurance tax deductions and related
settlement costs in addition we recorded a heldforsale adjustment of
approximately 15 million related to our international operations along with a
heldforsale adjustment for an investment in mexican solid waste operations of
approximately 28 million offsetting these expenses was a net gain of 24
million comprised of the reversal of the heldforsale impairment of 109
million and a heldforuse impairment of 85 million from our decision during
the third quarter of 2001 not to sell all but one of our ipps and the
reclassification in the third quarter of 2001 of all but one of our ipps from
heldforsale to heldforuse also included in asset impairments and unusual
items for 2001 are reversals of certain loss contract reserves of 13 million
that we determined to be in excess of current requirements

     in 2000 these costs were primarily due to our sale of our international
operations and the termination of wm holdings defined benefit pension plan
which are more fully described in notes 16 and 13 respectively to the
consolidated financial statements

  interest expense

     our interest expense decreased consistently each year from 2000 to 2002
the primary factor for the decrease in interest expense in 2002 is our interest
rate derivative contracts which are utilized to manage our interest rate
exposure and the general decline in interest rates interest rate swap
agreements reduced interest expense by 86 million for 2002 and contributed to
the decrease by 39 million in 2001 the remaining decrease in interest expense
in 2001 is primarily due to the pay down of debt with proceeds from our
divestitures and cash flows from operations in 2002 the refinancing of debt
instruments at lower interest rates created additional interest expense savings
additionally to further reduce interest expense we have increased our
utilization of taxexempt bond financing over the past two years as a lowercost
source of funding

  other income

     we experienced an increase in other income in 2002 as compared to prior
years due primarily to the sale of an equity investment in 2002 a company in
which we held an approximately 17 interest was acquired by another entity we
held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the
acquisition the proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our
equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately 43 million in the fourth
quarter of 2002

                                        30

  provision for income taxes

     we recorded a provision for income taxes of 424 million 284 million and
418 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively resulting in an effective
income tax rate of 340 361 and 1302 for each of the three years
respectively

     the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory
rate and reported income taxes for 2002 is primarily due to state and local
income taxes offset in part by nonconventional fuel tax credits in addition
we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 16 million due to a capital gain
generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefited capital
loss that arose from a divestiture a tax benefit of approximately 31 million
was also recognized in 2002 related to the carryback of losses by our dutch
subsidiary

     the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory
rate and reported income taxes for 2001 is primarily due to state and local
income taxes nondeductible costs associated with the impairment of certain
businesses the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested offset in part by
nonconventional fuel tax credits additionally in 2001 scheduled canadian
federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of 42 million
which was offset in part by a tax expense of 24 million related to our plan to
repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested
in canada

     the 1302 effective tax rate in 2000 is significantly higher than the
federal statutory rate due to state and local income taxes nondeductible costs
relating to acquired intangibles write down of investments in subsidiaries and
minority interest sales of foreign subsidiaries and the cost associated with
remitting earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently
reinvested offset in part by nonconventional tax credits

  extraordinary items

     during the first quarter of 2002 we refinanced approximately 49 million
of fixedrate tax exempt bonds maturing in 2011 with variablerate tax exempt
bonds maturing in 2022 as a result we incurred prepayment penalties and other
fees for a total charge net of tax benefit of approximately 1 million

     during the fourth quarter of 2002 we elected to repay approximately 145
million of our senior debt issuances prior to their maturity dates in
connection with these repayments we recognized an extraordinary charge of
approximately 2 million net of tax benefit for the prepayment penalties and
other costs related to the retired debt

     in the first quarter of 2001 we worked with local governmental authorities
to refinance 339 million of fixedrate taxexempt bonds maturing through 2008
with 326 million of variablerate taxexempt bonds maturing through 2011 and
17 million of fixedrate bonds that matured later in 2001 we recorded a net
extraordinary loss of 1 million for the remaining unamortized premium and
issuance costs related to the retired debt

     on july 17 1998 we issued 600 million of 6 18 mandatorily tendered
senior notes due july 15 2011 the notes were subject to certain mandatory
tender features as described in the indenture which allowed us to purchase all
of the outstanding notes on july 15 2001 we used available cash on hand along
with funds from our credit facility to purchase the notes in july 2001 during
the third quarter of 2001 we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately 1
million net of taxes for the retirement of this debt

  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle

     as a result of adopting sfas no 141 accounting for business combinations
sfas no 141 on january 1 2002 we were required to writeoff amounts of
negative goodwill that had been recorded in prior periods through purchase
accounting the aggregate amount of negative goodwill was 2 million and was
recorded as a credit to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in
the first quarter of 2002

                                        31
page

     sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
as amended sfas no 133 became effective for us as of january 1 2001
adoption of sfas no 133 resulted in a gain net of tax of approximately 2
million in the first quarter of 2001

     cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit
certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial
paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less

     our cash balances decreased 466 million from december 31 2001 to december
31 2002 this decrease is primarily attributable to capital expenditures our
stock repurchase program and the repayment of portions of our senior note
issuances prior to their maturity dates which exceeded our existing cash
balances and our 22 billion of operating cash flow

     in 2002 cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by cash received
of 166 million from counterparties for certain interest rate swap agreements
that we terminated prior to the scheduled maturities offset by cash paid of 66
million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into
to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances included
in our investing activities was cash paid of 13 billion for capital
expenditures and 162 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses these
expenditures were offset by proceeds of 487 million from other investing
activities primarily proceeds from sales of assets and net cash receipts from
restricted funds included in our financing activities was cash paid of 982
million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in addition we paid
697 million for net debt reductions and received 27 million from exercises of
common stock options and warrants

     in 2001 we generated cash flows from operations of approximately 24
billion favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of 59
million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against
certain insurance carriers and 64 million that we received from counterparties
when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled
maturities included in our investing activities was 13 billion of capital
expenditures and 116 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses these
expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing
activities of 212 million in addition we used 485 million for financing
activities which is comprised of 510 million of net debt reductions and 25
million of other financing activities offset by proceeds of 50 million from
exercises of common stock options and warrants and other financing activities

     in 2000 we spent 231 million to acquire businesses 13 billion in
capital expenditures and 33 billion on net debt reductions we financed these
cash expenditures primarily with 21 billion of cash flows from operations and
26 billion of proceeds from our divestitures a tax refund of approximately
200 million and our improvements in accounts receivable average days sale
outstanding favorably impacted cash flows from operations in 2000

     we operate in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various
financing sources is vital to our operations in the past we have been
successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider
attractive based on several key factors we believe considered by credit rating
agencies and

                                        32
page

financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing
we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future these
factors include

      the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse
       customer base

      our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows

      our asset base and

      our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and
       disciplined capital allocation

     in addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations we have
capital requirements for i capital expenditures for construction and expansion
of landfill sites as well as new trucks and equipment for collection and other
operations ii refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy facilities
and iii business acquisitions for 2003 we currently expect to spend
approximately 11 billion to 12 billion for capital expenditures

     in february 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved a
stock repurchase program for up to 1 billion in annual repurchases for each of
2002 2003 and 2004 to be implemented at managements discretion we expect to
utilize cash flows from operations for purchases made in either open market or
privately negotiated transactions

     the following is a summary of 2002 activity for our stock repurchase
program in millions except shares in thousands and price per share in

a  we accounted for the initial payment as a purchase of treasury stock and
     classified the future settlement with the counterparty as an equity
     instrument because we had the option under the agreement to settle our
     obligation if any in shares of our common stock

b  the weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation
     period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately 18
     million less than the approximately 300 million we initially paid
     pursuant to the terms of the agreement the counterparty paid us this
     difference of approximately 18 million at the end of the valuation period
     which occurred during the third quarter of 2002 to settle the agreement
     we accounted for the cash receipt as an adjustment to the carrying value of
     treasury stock and have therefore included it in common stock repurchases
     within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows

c  the weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation
     period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately 3 million
     less than the approximately 42 million we initially paid pursuant to the
     terms of the agreement the counterparty will pay us the difference of
     approximately 3 million at the end of the valuation period to settle the
     agreement

d  we engaged in open market purchases when trading was allowed pursuant to
     law and our insider trading policy

a  environmental liabilities include final closure postclosure and
     environmental remediation costs see note 8 to the consolidated financial
     statements for additional discussion

b  see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the
     nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations

     we have contingencies including guarantee arrangements that are deemed
not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above table see note 20 to
the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

     additionally we expect a net cash outflow after considering insurance
tax deductions and related settlement costs of approximately 230 to 240
million in 2003 for settlement of our securities class action lawsuit the
settlement fund began to accrue interest at the federal funds rate during the
second quarter of 2002 although payment will not become due until the judgment
is final which we expect to occur in 2003

     to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations as described above
our strategy is to utilize cash flows from operations we also have bank
borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and
when appropriate will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock

     as of december 31 2002 we had a 650 million syndicated revolving credit
facility the three year revolver and a 175 billion syndicated revolving
credit facility the five year revolver the three year revolver matures in
june 2005 and the five year revolver matures in june 2006 as of december 31
2002 we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately 175
billion of which approximately 163 billion are issued under the revolving
credit facilities that generally have terms allowing automatic renewal after a
year at december 31 2002 no balances were outstanding under our revolving
credit facilities and we had unused and available credit capacity under these
facilities of approximately 770 million

     as of december 31 2002 the financial covenants we are required to
maintain under our credit facilities include i an interest coverage ratio
ii total debt to ebitda and iii minimum net worth all as defined in the
credit facilities solely for the purpose of determining compliance with the
covenants the interest coverage ratio requires that at the end of any fiscal
quarter we will not permit the ratio of a our consolidated net income plus
interest expense and income taxes ebit for the four fiscal quarters then
ending to b consolidated total interest expense for such period to be less
than 25 to 1 for quarters ending on or before december 31 2002 and 3 to 1
thereafter the total debt to ebitda covenant requires that at the end of any
fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of a all indebtedness and certain
contingent liabilities such as financial guarantees to b ebit plus
depreciation and amortization expense ebitda for the four fiscal quarters
then ending to exceed 3 to 1 our minimum net worth covenant requires that we
will not allow the sum of stockholders equity to be less than 35 billion plus
75 of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter beginning
with the first fiscal quarter ended march 31 2001 at december 31 2002 we are
in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities and all other debt
instruments in january 2003 our total debt to ebitda covenant was amended to
not permit that ratio to exceed 325 to 1 rather than 3 to 1

     in november 2002 we privately placed 400 million of 6 38 senior
unsecured notes due 2012 interest on the notes is due on may 15 and november 15
of each year the net proceeds of the offering were approximately 396 million
after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses we used these proceeds
primarily to pay the 350 million of 65 senior notes that came due december
15 2002

                                        34

     in may 2002 we privately placed 500 million of 7 34 senior unsecured
notes due 2032 interest on the notes is due on november 15 and may 15 of each
year the net proceeds of the offering were approximately 498 million after
deducting underwriters discounts and expenses we used these proceeds to pay
the 300 million of 6625 senior notes that matured on july 15 2002 and a
portion of the 2857 million of 77 senior notes that matured on october 1
2002

     additionally we have issued industrial revenue bonds primarily for the
construction of various facilities proceeds from these financing arrangements
are directly deposited into trust funds and we do not have the ability to
utilize the funds in regular operating activities accordingly these amounts
are reported as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust
funds and a financing activity when the industrial revenue bonds are repaid at
december 31 2002 approximately 412 million of cash was held in trust to meet
future capital expenditures at various facilities

     we have 434 million of 6375 senior notes due december 1 2003 we also
have 450 million of 71 senior notes due august 1 2026 that are subject to
early redemption on august 1 2003 at the option of the holders we have
classified approximately 770 million of these borrowings as longterm at
december 31 2002 based upon our ability to use our revolving credit facilities
which are both longterm to refinance these borrowings at their respective
maturity or repayment date we intend to pursue other sources of longterm
financing to refinance the borrowings however in the event other sources of
longterm financing are not available we intend to use our revolving credit
facilities

     we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using
interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating
rate debt which is approximately 70 fixed and 30 floating at december 31
2002 in addition we periodically enter into derivative transactions to secure
the then current market interest rate in anticipation of senior debt issuances

     during 2002 we entered into hedging agreements to secure the underlying
treasury rates in anticipation of our 2002 senior note issuances we settled
with the counterparties for approximately 66 million which was paid
concurrently with related 2002 senior note issuances discussed above

     in 2002 we elected to terminate several interest rate swap agreements with
a notional amount of 295 billion prior to the scheduled maturities and
received cash of approximately 200 million which is comprised of 166 million
for the fair value of the swaps that were terminated and 34 million of accrued
but unpaid interest receivable from the counterparties to the interest rate
swaps under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives the
unamortized adjustment to longterm debt for the terminated swaps remains
classified as longterm debt the proceeds received from the termination of the
interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in other assets
or other liabilities within operating activities in the consolidated statement
of cash flows

variable interest entities

     on june 30 2000 two limited liability companies llcs were established
to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three
wastetoenergy facilities that we operate under an agreement with the owner
john hancock life insurance company hancock has a 995 ownership in one of
the llcs the second llc is 995 collectively owned by hancock and the cit
group cit and we own the remaining 05 interest in each hancock and cit
made an initial investment of approximately 167 million in the llcs the llcs
used these proceeds to purchase the three wastetoenergy facilities that we
operate and assumed the sellers indebtedness related to these facilities under
the llc agreements the llcs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of
the following events i a written decision of all the members of the llcs to
dissolve ii december 31 2063 iii the entry of a decree of judicial
dissolution under the delaware limited liability company act or iv the llcs
ceasing to own any interest in these wastetoenergy facilities income losses
and cash flows are allocated to the members based on their initial capital
account balances until hancock and cit achieve targeted returns thereafter the
amounts will be allocated 20 to hancock and cit and 80 to us we do not expect
hancock and cit to achieve the targeted returns in 2003 or at any time during
the initial base term of the lease we account for the underlying leases as
operating leases we are required under certain circumstances to make capital
contributions to the llcs in the amount of the difference between the stipulated
loss amounts and termination values under the llc

                                        35

agreements to the extent they are different from the underlying lease
agreements we believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of these
circumstances is remote

     during 2002 we had aggregate lease payments of approximately 62 million
under the llc agreements if we exercise certain renewal options under the
leases we will be required to make capital contributions to the llcs for the
difference if any between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents
as of december 31 2002 the remaining aggregate lease commitments related to
these wastetoenergy facilities are 526 million which includes 158 million
in required capital contributions to the llc for the amount of the difference
between bargain renewals and the fair value of the lease these minimum lease
payments are included in the table of noncancelable rental obligations as
discussed in note 20 of the consolidated financial statements

     we are the manager of the llcs but there are significant limitations on the
powers of the manager under the llc agreements accordingly we account for our
interest in the llcs under the equity method of accounting these investments
had a carrying value of approximately 1 million at both december 31 2002 and
december 31 2001 if we were required to consolidate the llcs we would record
approximately 414 million in assets and 208 million of debt as of december
31 2002 the remaining balance that would be recorded would primarily be
minority interest there would be no material net impact to our results of
operations if we consolidated the llcs instead of accounting for them under the
equity method

accounting for stock options

     we account for our stockbased compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for
stock issued to employees as amended under which no compensation cost for
stock options is recognized when granted with an exercise price equal to fair
value sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas no 123
establishes accounting and annual disclosure requirements for options granted
after 1994 using a fairvaluebased method of accounting as of december 31
2002 2001 and 2000 we had approximately 445 million 415 million and 403
million stock options and warrants outstanding respectively the weighted
average fair value per share of stock options granted during 2002 2001 and 2000
as determined under sfas no 123 was 1216 1083 and 678 respectively

     the fair value of each common stock option granted to employees or
directors during 2002 2001 and 2000 is estimated utilizing the blackscholes
option pricing model blackscholes is a formula that calculates an estimated
value of stock options based on appreciation and interest rate assumptions and
therefore the fair value calculation of a stock option using blackscholes is
not necessarily indicative of the actual value of a stock option the following
weighted average assumptions were used dividend yield of 0 riskfree interest
rates which vary for each grant and range from 291 to 619 expected life of
four to seven years for all grants and stock price volatility primarily ranging
from 237 to 504

     the following schedule reflects the impact on net income and earnings per
common share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no
123 to stock based employee compensation in millions except per share
amounts

seasonality and inflation

     our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months
which corresponds with our first and fourth quarters this is mostly because i
the volume of construction and demolition waste is lower in the winter because
there is less construction activity and ii the volume of industrial and
residential waste in certain regions where we operate tends to decrease during
the winter months

     we do not believe that inflation has nor do we expect it to have any
material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future

recent developments

     in january 2003 we announced that we had formed a new recycling entity
recycle america alliance llc raa a whollyowned subsidiary in an
effort to optimize the capacity and improve the profitability of our recycling
operations in connection with the formation of raa we transferred
substantially all recycling assets and businesses of our other subsidiaries to
raa raas strategy includes combining its assets and operations with a number
of key processors and marketers on january 10 2003 the peltz group the
largest privatelyheld recycler in the united states contributed all of its
assets to raa in exchange for an initial payment by raa of approximately 58
million in cash and the issuance of approximately 9 of the equity interest in
raa

     in february 2003 we announced that we will implement further restructuring
to reorganize our operations into a smaller number of market areas in an effort
to reduce overhead costs as part of the restructuring there will be a net
workforce reduction of about 700 employees and 270 contract workers we
anticipate a charge of approximately 23 million for this restructuring

new accounting pronouncements and other accounting changes

  new accounting pronouncements

  sfas no 143

     in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas
no 143 sfas no 143 applies to all legally enforceable obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and provides the accounting
and reporting requirements for such obligations sfas no 143 requires amounts
initially recognized as an asset retirement obligation to be measured at fair
value the recognized asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the cost
of the asset and is depreciated over the useful life of the asset

     sfas no 143 which will primarily impact the accounting for our landfill
operations does not change the basic landfill accounting followed historically
by us along with others in the waste industry in general the waste industry
has recognized expenses associated with both amortization of capitalized costs
and future closure and postclosure obligations on a unitsofconsumption basis
as airspace is consumed over the life of the related landfill this practice
referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry will continue to
be followed upon adoption of sfas no 143 except as discussed below

     under the new rules costs associated with future final capping activities
that occur during the operating life of a landfill which are currently
recognized on an undiscounted basis over the operating life of the landfill as
airspace is consumed will be accounted for as an asset retirement obligation
on a discounted basis we expect to recognize landfill retirement obligations
that relate to closure and postclosure activities over the operating life of a
landfill as landfill airspace is consumed and the obligation is incurred we
expect to recognize our final capping obligations on a discrete basis for each
expected future final capping event over the number of tons of waste that each
final capping event is expected to cover these obligations will be initially
measured at estimated fair value fair value will be measured on a present value
basis using a creditadjusted riskfree rate initially 725 which is higher
than the riskfree rate previously used for discounting closure and postclosure
obligations interest will be accreted on all landfill retirement obligations
using the effective interest method landfill retirement costs arising from
closure and postclosure obligations which will be capitalized as part of the
landfill asset will be amortized using our existing landfill accounting
practices

landfill retirement costs arising from final capping obligations which will
also be capitalized as part of the landfill asset will be amortized on a
unitsofconsumption basis over the number of tons of waste that each final
capping event covers

landfill accounting practices and the requirements of sfas no 143

     we will adopt sfas no 143 beginning january 1 2003 and based on current
estimates will record an aftertax expense ranging from 180 million to 230
million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we expect
that the impact of adopting sfas no 143 in 2003 will decrease earnings per
share from our previous method by approximately 008 per diluted share the
adoption of sfas no 143 will have no net effect on our cash flow

  sfas no 145

     in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements
no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections
sfas no 145 sfas no 145 requires that gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet
the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 30 opinion no 30
applying the provisions of opinion no 30 will distinguish transactions that are
part of an entitys recurring operations from those that are unusual and
infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item
sfas no 145 is effective for us beginning january 1 2003 upon the adoption of
sfas no 145 we will reclassify certain items in our prior period statements of
operations to conform to the presentation required by sfas no 145 under sfas
no 145 we will report gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt in
pretax earnings rather than in extraordinary items

  sfas no 146

     in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities sfas no 146 sfas no 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities such as restructurings involuntarily terminating employees and
consolidating facilities initiated after december 31 2002 the implementation
of sfas no 146 will not require the restatement of previously issued financial
statements implementation of the pronouncement will therefore have no impact on
our current year financial statements we will apply sfas no 146 requirements
to our 2003 restructuring see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements
for further discussion

  fin 45

     in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect
guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 45 it clarifies that a guarantor
is required to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the
fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee including its
ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in
the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur the
objective of the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the
guarantee at its inception the initial recognition and initial measurement
provisions of fin 45 are effective for us on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued after december 31 2002 we will record the fair value of future material
guarantees if any see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for
current disclosure requirements related to our guarantee arrangements

  fin 46

     in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 fin 46 fin 46
requires that unconsolidated variable interest entities be consolidated by their
primary beneficiaries a primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a
majority of the entitys expected losses or residual benefits fin 46 applies
immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to
existing variable interest entities in the periods beginning after june 15
2003 see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on our
existing variable interests we have yet to determine the impact that the
adoption of fin 46 will have on our consolidated financial statements

  other accounting changes

  repairs and maintenance

     through december 31 2002 we accrued in advance for major repairs and
maintenance expenditures at our wastetoenergy facilities and ipps effective
january 1 2003 we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses
these costs as they are incurred in the first quarter of 2003 we expect to
record approximately 30 million net of taxes as a credit to cumulative effect
of an accounting change

  loss contract accrual

     through december 31 2002 we accrued for future losses for contracts that
over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than
revenues effective january 1 2003 we changed our policy from this method to
one that expenses these costs as they are incurred in the first quarter of
2003 we expect to record approximately 30 million net of taxes as a credit
to cumulative effect of an accounting change



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

     in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk including
changes in interest rates foreign currency rates certain commodity prices and
certain equity prices from time to time we and certain of our subsidiaries use
derivatives to manage some portion of these risks our derivatives are
agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on a
notional amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2002 all
of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our
transactions with the exception of certain derivatives related to the fiber
commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes we are exposed to
credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivatives
however we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our
positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either
consider credit worthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their
performance see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion
regarding terminated fiber agreements with enron north america corp enron

     we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes
might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related
positions this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular
hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary significantly
from

                                        40
page

our assumptions the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly
affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity
analysis fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate
cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements

     interest rate exposure  our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are denominated
in us dollars in addition we use interest rate swaps to either lockin or
limit the variability in the interest rates to manage the mix of fixed and
floating rate debt obligations an instantaneous one percentage point decrease
in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would
increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at
december 31 2002 and 2001 by approximately 482 million and 394 million
respectively this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest
rates would have on other items such as new borrowings nor the favorable
impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest since
a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates changes in market interest
rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our
fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity

     currency rate exposure  from time to time we and certain of our
subsidiaries have used foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of
currency translation on cash flows on intercompany foreigncurrency denominated
debt an instantaneous ten percent decrease in foreign exchange rates at
december 31 2002 would have no material impact to the company we had no
foreign currency derivatives at december 31 2001

     commodities price exposure  we market recycled waste paper products such
as onp and occ from our material recovery facilities we enter into financial
fiber swaps to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these
sales under these swap agreements we pay a floating index price and receive a
fixed price for a fixed period of time we also enter into fiber swap agreements
for trading purposes with the objective of generating profits from changes in
market prices of waste paper and other paper products we record changes in the
fair value of these fiber swap agreements not designated as hedges immediately
to earnings all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management
policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used and our risk
exposure limits an instantaneous ten percent increase in occ and onp prices at
december 31 2002 would decrease the fair value of our hedges by approximately
112 million this analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity sales
positions that are being hedged an instantaneous ten percent increase in prices
at december 31 2002 on our derivatives entered into for trading purposes would
have no material impact on us

     at december 31 2001 all except two of our fiber agreements were with
enron due to enrons financial situation collectibility of the funds
associated with these instruments was not probable at december 31 2001 and
therefore these instruments were estimated to have no fair value the
derivatives with enron were subsequently terminated in early 2002 the net fair
value of the two derivatives with counterparties other than enron at december
31 2001 was not material

     see notes 2 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further
discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments

entities and independent power markets during 2001 none of our customers
accounted for more than 5 of our operating revenue we employed approximately
57000 people as of december 31 2001

     the company was incorporated in oklahoma in 1987 under the name usa waste
services inc and was reincorporated as a delaware company in 1995 in 1998
we merged with waste management inc who became our 100 owned subsidiary and
whose name we changed to waste management holdings inc or wm holdings the
wm holdings merger at the same time we changed our name to waste

     in the past our primary growth strategy was to purchase revenue through
acquisitions in 1999 the company announced a strategic plan focused on
emphasizing internal growth and focusing on our core business  north american
solid waste nasw services as part of the plan beginning in 1999 and
throughout 2000 and 2001 we divested all of our waste management operations
outside of north america our operations outside of north america consisted of
the collection and transportation of solid hazardous and medical wastes and
recyclable materials and the treatment and disposal of recyclable materials
also included were the operation of solid and hazardous waste landfills
municipal and hazardous waste incinerators water and wastewater treatment
facilities hazardous waste treatment facilities wastefuel powered independent
power facilities and the construction of treatment or disposal facilities for
third parties

     the company divested most of its nonsolid waste operations in 2000 which
included all hazardous lowlevel and other radioactive waste management and
other nonnasw services except for hazardous waste landfills which are
included in nasw operations our hazardous waste management services included
the collection transfer and treatment of hazardous waste our lowlevel and
other radioactive waste services generally consisted of disposal processing and
various other special services related to these types of waste additionally we
provided hazardous radioactive and mixed waste program and facilities
management services included in our remaining nonsolid waste operations are
our independent power production plants ipps which include the operation
and in some cases the ownership of ipps that either cogenerate electricity and
thermal energy or generate electricity alone for sale to customers including
public utilities and industrial customers in 2000 we classified our ipps as
heldforsale operations however in the third quarter of 2001 we reevaluated
our business alternatives and decided to hold and operate all but one of the
ipps as such we reclassified all but one of our ipps in the third quarter of
2001 from heldforsale to heldforuse

     also included in our remaining nonsolid waste operations at yearend were
our geosynthetic manufacturing and installation services these operations
generally consisted of fabricating and installing landfill liners these
operations which were marketed for sale in 2001 and which were classified as
heldforsale operations in the companys consolidated financial statements
included in this report were sold in the first quarter of 2002 as described in
note 25 subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements

  north american solid waste

     we manage our nasw operations through six operating areas all of which
have similar operating economies these six areas are comprised of four areas
organized by geographic territories in the united states plus our whollyowned
subsidiaries wheelabrator technologies inc referred to together with its
subsidiaries as wti which overlaps certain of the us areas and canadian
waste services inc which provides services throughout most provinces in
canada each of the areas generally encompasses several states or provinces and
has a member of senior management responsible for all operational aspects of
such area we have further divided the geographic areas into regions that
include several economic market places the regions vice presidents oversee the
districts or the basic operating locations within each area whose manager is
directly responsible for daytoday operations the nasw services provided by
these areas include collection disposal solid waste landfills hazardous waste
landfills and wastetoenergy facilities transfer recycling and other
services in the united states and canada

     collection  collection involves picking up and transporting waste from
where it was generated to a transfer station or disposal site depending on the
type of customer being served we generally provide collection services under
one of two types of arrangements

      for commercial and industrial collection services there is generally a
       one to threeyear service agreement the fees under the agreements are
       determined by factors such as collection frequency type of collection
       equipment furnished by the company type and volume or weight of the
       waste collected the distance to the disposal facility labor cost and
       cost of disposal as part of the service we provide steel containers to
       most of the commercial and industrial customers to store their solid
       waste the containers range in size from one to 50 cubic yards and are
       designed so that they can be lifted mechanically and either emptied into
       a trucks compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site by using
       these containers we can service most of our commercial and industrial
       customers with trucks operated by only one employee

      for most residential collection services there is a contract with or
       franchise granted by a municipality or regional authority that has
       granted the company the exclusive right to service all or a portion of
       the homes in that area these contracts or franchises are typically for
       one to five years but can sometimes be longer the fees for residential
       collection are either paid by the authorities from their tax revenues or
       service charges or are paid directly by the residents receiving the
       service

     disposal  landfills are the main depository for solid waste in north
america solid waste landfills are located on land with geological and
hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water pollution and are
operated under prescribed procedures currently solid waste landfills in the
united states must be designed permitted operated closed and maintained after
closure in compliance with federal state and local regulations pursuant to
subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 as amended
rcra the operation of a solid waste landfill includes excavation
construction of liners and final caps continuous spreading and compacting of
waste and covering of waste with earth or other inert material at least once a
day these operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary conditions and
to ensure the best possible use of the airspace and prepare the site so it can
ultimately be used for other purposes

     access to a disposal facility such as a solid waste landfill is a
necessity for all solid waste management companies while access can be obtained
to disposal facilities owned or operated by unaffiliated third parties we
believe it is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal
facilities that we own or operate that way the company achieves greater
internalization by paying itself instead of a third party thus achieving higher
consolidated margins the fees charged at disposal facilities which are known
as tipping fees are based on market factors and the type and weight or volume
of solid waste deposited and the type and size of the vehicles used in the
transportation of the waste

     we also operate five secure hazardous waste landfills in the united states
under rcra all hazardous waste landfills must be permitted by the federal
government and all of ours have obtained such permits these landfills must
also comply with certain operating standards and our hazardous waste landfills
have received the permits and approvals needed to accept hazardous waste
although some of them can only accept certain kinds of hazardous waste only
hazardous waste in a stable solid form which meets applicable regulatory
requirements can be deposited in our secure disposal cells our hazardous waste
landfills are sited constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide
longterm containment of the waste

     in some cases hazardous waste can be treated before disposal generally
these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from
liquids and chemical treatments that involve the transformation of wastes into
inert materials that are no longer hazardous the company operates a hazardous
waste facility at which it isolates treated hazardous wastes in liquid form by
injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock formations far below
the base of fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial
geological confining layers

     we owned or operated 297 solid waste and five hazardous landfills at
december 31 2001 based on remaining permitted capacity as of december 31 2001
and projected annual disposal volumes the average remaining landfill life for
these landfills is approximately 21 years many of our existing landfills have
the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted
we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our
landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based
on estimated future waste volumes and prices remaining capacity and likelihood
of obtaining an expansion we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity
at 105 of our landfills for which we consider these expansions to be probable
although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted
as designed the average remaining landfill life for all landfills is
approximately 31 years when considering remaining permitted capacity probable
expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume for the companys
operating landfills as of december 31 2001 the expected remaining airspace
capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at the
landfill is shown below in millions

     through wti we also own or operate through agreements 16 wastetoenergy
facilities which in addition to landfills are facilities that accept solid
waste for disposal our wastetoenergy facilities are capable of processing up
to 23600 tons of solid waste each day the solid waste is burned at these
facilities producing heat that is converted into highpressure steam we use
that steam to generate electricity for sales to public utility and industrial
companies under longterm contracts our wastetoenergy facilities can generate
up to 635 megawatts mw of electricity per hour enough to power
approximately 555000 homes

     transfer stations  a transfer station is a facility located near
residential and commercial collection routes where collection trucks take the
solid waste that has been collected the solid waste is then transferred via
transfer trucks or rail to disposal sites fees at transfer stations are usually
based on the type and volume or weight of the waste transferred and the distance
to the disposal site at december 31 2001 we operated approximately 300
transfer stations in north america there are two main reasons for using
transfer stations

      their use reduces the costs associated with transporting waste to final
       disposal sites this cost reduction is due to the fact that the trucks
       railcars or rail containers that we use for transfer have a larger
       capacity than the collection trucks again allowing more waste to be
       transported to the disposal facility in each trip the consolidation of
       the waste also increases the efficient use of our collection personnel
       and equipment since they are not making trips to the disposal sites and
       instead are focusing on collection

      the use of transfer stations also improves internalization by allowing us
       to pay ourselves rather than a third party the fees charged to dispose
       of waste we picked up a greater percentage of the waste we collect can
       be disposed of at one of our own disposal sites rather than having to
       use a closer disposal

                                        5

      site owned by a third party when our transfer station is used because the
      waste coming into one of our transfer stations will usually be taken to
      one of our own disposal facilities as the transfer vehicles can transport
      waste longer distances more efficiently than the collection vehicles we
      are able to internalize more waste

     recycling  the company provides recycling services in the united states
and canada through its recycle americar recycle canadar and other
complementary programs recycling involves the removal of reusable materials
from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition for use in
various applications our commercial and industrial operations include
collection including customized collection programs data destruction
shredding automated sorting and construction and demolition processing we use
stateoftheart technology for sorting and processing glass to remove
contaminants and color separate the glass which increases material recovery and
delivers higher quality recovered materials to manufacturers we also provide
complete management marketing programs for processing inventory and sale of
recovered plastic and rubber in recent years our recycling operations have
also focused on the recovery of electronic scrap instituting programs for the
collection and recycling of electronic materials

     as part of our residential solid waste collection services we also engage
in curbside collection of recyclable materials from residences in the united
states and canada curbside recycling services generally involve the collection
of recyclable paper glass plastic and metal waste materials which may be
separated by residents into different waste containers or disposed of together
all as recyclable materials recyclable materials are deposited by one of our
collection trucks or by residents themselves at a local materials recovery
facility mrf for weighing processing and marketing we operate over 190
mrfs where paper glass metals plastics and compost are recovered for resale
and 18 secondary processing facilities where materials received from mrfs are
processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods our
recycling operations include the marketing and reselling of recyclable materials
on behalf of our own facilities as well as for third parties

     fees for recycling services are determined by such considerations as market
factors frequency of collection type and volume or weight of the recyclable
material degree of processing required distance the recyclable material must
be transported and the market value of the recovered material

     other nasw  as part of our other nasw operations we operate methane gas
recovery projects at 69 of our owned or operated solid waste landfill
facilities these operations involve the installation of a gas collection system
into a solid waste landfill through the gas collection system methane gas
generated by decomposing solid waste is collected and transported to a
gasprocessing facility at the landfill site through physical and chemical
processes methane gas is separated from contaminants at 37 of our facilities
the processed methane gas is sold to an affiliate of the company which uses it
as a fuel to power electricity generators the generated electricity is then
sold usually to public utilities or industrial customers under longterm sales
contracts often under terms or conditions which are subject to approval by
regulatory authorities at the remaining 32 landfills the methane gas is sold
directly to industrial customers who use it as an alternative to fossil fuel in
industrial processes such as steam boilers cement kilns and utility plants

     in addition as part of our other nasw operations we rent and service
portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under
the name portoletr and provide street and parking lot sweeping services

     we also provide inplant services in which we outsource our employees to
provide full service waste management to customers at their plants our
vertically integrated waste management operations allow us to provide these
customers with full management of their waste including choosing the right
sized containers finding recycling opportunities minimizing their waste and
transporting and disposing of their waste

  other

     the companys other business segment consists of its nonsolid waste
operations including a geosynthetic manufacturing and installation service
which generally involves the making and installing of landfill liners this
business was marketed for sale in 2001 and has been classified as heldforsale
operations in the consolidated financial statements included in this report the
business was sold in the first quarter of 2002 as described in note 25 to the
consolidated financial statements

     also included in other are the companys ipps which convert various waste
fuels into electricity the ipps combust wood waste anthracite culm tires
landfill gas and natural gas the wood waste facilities combust the waste
products of the forest products industry waste from agricultural operations
and are integral to the solid waste industry disposing of urban wood waste
tires and railroad tiesutility poles the anthracite culm project uses the ash
from old mine waste piles and reclaims the unusable land beneath in addition to
electricity production the ipps also produce steam which is sold to a state
hospital a prison sawmills a particleboard plant and a pulppaper complex
the ipps produce a total of 248 mw of electricity per hour enough to power
approximately 225000 homes

     in addition the company has a derivative trading operation that is just
getting started the primary purpose of this operation is to hedge our exposure
to price fluctuations in the pulp and paper commodity markets

competition

     the solid waste industry is very competitive the competition is from a
number of publiclyheld companies locallyowned private solid waste services
companies and large commercial and industrial companies handling their own
waste collection or disposal operations we also have competition from
municipalities and other regional government authorities with respect to
residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills the
municipalities and other regional governmental authorities can sometimes offer
lower direct charges to the customer for the same service by subsidizing the
cost of services through the use of tax revenues and taxexempt financing

     operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout
the geographic areas in which we operate the prices that we charge are
determined locally and typically vary by the volume type of waste collected
treatment requirements risks involved in the handling or disposing of waste
frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites labor costs and
amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we face intense
competition for both quality of service and pricing considerations from time to
time competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept lower profit
margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to successfully
obtain competitively bid contracts

employees

     at december 31 2001 the company had approximately 57000 fulltime
employees of which approximately 8000 were employed in clerical
administrative and sales positions approximately 6000 in management and the
balance in collection disposal transfer station and other operations
approximately 14000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements the company has not experienced a significant work stoppage and
management considers its employee relations to be good

insurance and financial assurance obligations

     we carry a broad range of insurance coverages including general liability
automobile liability real and personal property workers compensation
directors and officers liability pollution legal liability and other
coverages we believe are customary to the industry except as may be discussed
in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report we
do not expect the impact of any known casualty property environmental
insurance or other contingency to be material to our financial condition
results of operations or cash flows

                                        7
page

     through december 31 2001 we have not experienced any difficulty in
obtaining insurance however the tragic events of september 11th have had an
impact upon the financial status of a number of insurance surety and
reinsurance providers which could in turn cause an increase in the cost and a
decrease in the availability of surety and insurance coverages available to us
in the future if we were unable to obtain adequate insurance in the future
obtained insurance from a company that was ultimately unable to satisfy its
commitments or decided to operate without insurance any partially or
completely uninsured claim against us if successful and of sufficient
magnitude could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition
results of operations or cash flows additionally our continued access to
casualty and pollution legal liability insurance with sufficient limits at
acceptable terms is an important aspect of obtaining revenueproducing waste
service contracts

     for the 14 months ended january 1 2000 the company insured certain risks
including auto general and workers compensation with reliance national
insurance company reliance on june 11 2001 the ultimate parent of
reliance reliance group holdings inc filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11
of the united state bankruptcy code of 1978 as amended the bankruptcy code
on october 3 2001 reliance was placed in liquidation by a pennsylvania court
we have determined that we will have coverage through various state insurance
guarantee funds in some but not all of the jurisdictions where we are subject
to claims that would have been covered by the reliance insurance program while
it is not possible to predict the outcome of proceedings involving reliance we
believe that because of the various insurance guarantee funds and potential
recoveries from the liquidation it is unlikely that events relating to reliance
will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements however we
believe that the ultimate resolution of claims that would have been covered by
reliance may take several years

     municipal and governmental waste management contracts typically require
performance bonds or bank letters of credit to secure performance we are also
required to provide financial assurance for the final closure and postclosure
obligations with respect to our landfills we establish financial assurance in
different ways depending on the jurisdiction including escrowtype accounts
funded by revenues during the operational life of a facility letters of credit
from third parties surety bonds trust agreements and traditional insurance we
also use captive insurance or insurance policies issued by a whollyowned
insurance company subsidiary national guaranty insurance company ngic the
sole business of which is to issue such policies to the company in order to
secure such obligations ngic is authorized to write up to 901 million in
insurance policies or surety bonds for our final closure and postclosure
requirements in those instances where the use of captive insurance is not
acceptable we have available alternative bonding mechanisms

     as of december 31 2001 we had provided letters of credit of approximately
16 billion approximately 15 billion of which are issued under our 175
billion syndicated revolving credit facility surety bonds of approximately
27 billion trust agreements of approximately 71 million financial
guarantees of approximately 63 million and insurance policies of approximately
830 million including 798 million written by ngic to municipalities
customers and regulatory authorities supporting taxexempt bonds performance of
landfill final closure and postclosure requirements insurance contracts
municipal contracts and financial guarantee obligations to date we have not
experienced unusual difficulty in obtaining financial assurance for our
operations however continued availability of letters of credit surety bonds
and insurance policies in sufficient amounts at acceptable rates is a vital
aspect of our ongoing operations financial assurance is generally a requirement
for obtaining additional taxexempt financing and municipal collection
contracts and for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station
operating permits

regulation

     our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal state local and
foreign environmental health safety and transportation laws and regulations
these laws and regulations are administered by the epa and various other
federal state and local environmental zoning transportation land use
health and safety agencies in the united states and various other agencies
outside of the united states many of these agencies regularly examine our
operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations governmental
authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations
and to obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of
violations

                                        8
page

     because the major component of our business is the collection and disposal
of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner a significant amount of our
capital expenditures are related either directly or indirectly to
environmental protection measures including compliance with federal state and
local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment there are costs associated with siting design
operations monitoring site maintenance corrective actions financial
assurance and facility closure and postclosure obligations in connection with
our acquisition development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer
station we must often spend considerable time effort and money to obtain or
maintain necessary required permits and approvals there cannot be any
assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain necessary governmental
approvals once obtained operating permits are subject to modification and
revocation by the issuing agency compliance with these and any future
regulatory requirements could require the company to make significant capital
and operating expenditures however most of these expenditures are made in the
normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage

     the primary united states federal statutes affecting our business are
summarized below

      rcra regulates the handling transportation and disposal of hazardous and
       nonhazardous wastes and delegates authority to states to develop
       programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid wastes in 1991 the epa
       issued its final regulations under subtitle d of rcra which set forth
       minimum federal performance and design criteria for solid waste
       landfills these regulations must be implemented by the states although
       states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the subtitle
       d standards from time to time we may incur costs in complying with
       these standards in the ordinary course of its operations however all of
       our planned landfill developments and expansions will be engineered to
       meet or exceed applicable subtitle d requirements and we do not believe
       that such costs would have a material adverse effect on our operations

      the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act
       of 1980 as amended which is also known as superfund cercla
       provides for federal authority to respond directly to releases or
       threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment
       cerclas primary means for avoiding such releases is to impose liability
       for cleanup of disposal sites on current owners and operators the owners
       and operators at the time of disposal as well as the generators of the
       waste and the transporters who select the disposal site liability under
       cercla is not dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous wastes
       it can be based upon the release or threatened release even as a result
       of lawful unintentional and nonnegligent action of any one of the more
       than 700 hazardous substances listed by the epa even in very small
       quantities

      the federal water pollution control act of 1972 the clean water act
       establishes rules for regulating the discharge of pollutants into
       streams rivers groundwater or other surface waters from a variety of
       sources including solid waste disposal sites if runoff from our
       operations may be discharged into surface waters the clean water act
       requires us to apply for and obtain discharge permits conduct sampling
       and monitoring and under certain circumstances reduce the quantity of
       pollutants in those discharges in 1990 the epa issued additional rules
       under the clean water act which establish standards for management of
       storm water runoff from landfills and which require landfills to obtain
       storm water discharge permits in addition if a landfill or a transfer
       station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned
       treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed
       by the treatment works also if development of a landfill may alter or
       affect wetlands a permit may have to be obtained before such
       development could commence affecting the construction or expansion of
       many landfill sites the clean water act provides for civil criminal and
       administrative penalties for violations of its provisions

      the clean air act of 1970 as amended the clean air act provides for
       increased federal state and local regulation of the emission of air
       pollutants the epa has applied the clean air act to certain of our
       operations including solid waste landfills and waste collection
       vehicles additionally in 1996 the epa issued new source performance
       standards for new landfills and emission guidelines for existing
       landfills to control emissions of landfill gases the regulations impose
       limits on air emissions from solid

                                        9
page

       waste landfills subject most of our solid waste landfills to certain
       permitting requirements and in some instances require installation of
       methane gas recovery systems to reduce emissions to allowable limits the
       company already operates methane gas recovery systems at 69 of its solid
       waste landfills the company does not believe that continued costs of
       compliance with clean air act permitting and emission control
       requirements will have a material adverse effect on the company

      the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended osha
       establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a
       workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious
       injury compliance with standards promulgated by the occupational safety
       and health administration and various record keeping disclosures and
       procedural requirements various standards for notices of hazards safety
       in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos may
       apply to our operations

     there are also various state and local regulations that affect our
operations generally states have their own laws and regulations that are
sometimes more strict than comparable federal laws and regulations governing
solid waste disposal water and air pollution releases and cleanup of hazardous
substances and liability for such matters additionally our collection and
landfill operations could be affected by the trend toward requiring the
development of waste reduction and recycling programs legislative and
regulatory measures to either require or encourage waste reduction at the source
and waste recycling have also been considered by the united states congress and
the epa

     various states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that
restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the
state while laws that overtly discriminate against outofstate waste have been
found to be unconstitutional some laws that are less overtly discriminatory
have been upheld in court additionally certain state and local governments
have enacted flow control regulations which attempt to require that all waste
generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites
in 1994 the united states supreme court ruled that a flow control ordinance was
unconstitutional however other courts have refused to apply the supreme court
precedent in various circumstances in addition from time to time the united
states congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt
regulations restrictions or taxes on the importation of outofstate or
outofjurisdiction waste these congressional efforts have been unsuccessful
the united states congress adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on
interstate transportation of outofstate or outofjurisdiction waste or
certain types of flow control the adoption of legislation affecting interstate
transportation of waste at the state level or the courts interpretation or
validation of flow control legislation could adversely affect the companys
solid waste management services

     many states and local jurisdictions have enacted fitness laws that allow
the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to
deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or permit
holders compliance history some states and local jurisdictions go further and
consider the compliance history of the parent subsidiaries or affiliated
companies in addition to the applicant or permit holder these laws authorize
the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit holders fitness
to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit
because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit
holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies
and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and
regulations

factors influencing future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements

     when we make statements containing projections about our accounting and
finances about our plans and objectives for the future about our future
economic performance or containing any other projections or estimates about our
assumptions relating to these types of statements we are making forwardlooking
statements these statements usually relate to future events and anticipated
revenues earnings or other aspects of our operations or operating results we
make these statements in an effort to keep stockholders and the public informed
about our business and have based them on our current expectations about future
events you should view such statements with caution these statements are not
guarantees of future performance or events all phases of our business are
subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which the company
has no control over any of these factors either alone or taken together could
have a material

                                        10
page

adverse effect on the company and could change whether any forwardlooking
statement ultimately turns out to be true additionally the company assumes no
obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of future events
or developments

     outlined below are some of the risks that the company faces and that could
affect our business and financial statements for 2002 and beyond however they
are not the only risks that the company faces there may be additional risks
that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial
which could also impair our business

  we could be liable for environmental damages resulting from our operations

     we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our
properties or to nearby landowners particularly as a result of the
contamination of drinking water sources or soil under current law we could
even be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we
acquired the assets or operations involved also we could be liable if we
arrange for the transportation disposal or treatment of hazardous substances
that cause environmental contamination or if a predecessor owner made such
arrangements and under applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior
owner any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

     in the ordinary course of our business we have and may in the future
become involved in a variety of legal and administrative proceedings relating to
land use and environmental laws and regulations these include proceedings in
which

      agencies of federal state local or foreign governments seek to impose
       liability on us under applicable statutes sometimes involving civil or
       criminal penalties or violations or to revoke or deny renewal of a
       permit we need and

      citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies oppose the
       issuance renewal or expansion of a permit or approval we need allege
       violations of the permits or approval under which we operate or laws or
       regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us
       for environmental damage

     the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and
cash flows

     from timetotime we have received citations or notices from governmental
authorities alleging that our operations are not in compliance with our permits
or certain applicable environmental or land use laws and regulations in the
future we may receive additional citations or notices we generally seek to work
with the authorities to resolve the issues raised by such citations or notices
however we cannot guarantee that we will always be successful in this regard
where we are not successful we may incur fines penalties or other sanctions
that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of
operations and cash flows

     our insurance for environmental liability meets or exceeds statutory
requirements however because we believe that the cost for such insurance is
high relative to the coverage it would provide our coverages are generally
maintained only at statutorily required levels due to the limited nature of our
insurance coverage for environmental liability if we were to incur liability
for environmental damage in excess of any coverage such liability could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and
cash flows

     in addition to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to
environmental closure and postclosure liabilities we generally obtain letters
of credit or surety bonds or rely on insurance including captive insurance we
currently have in place all necessary financial assurance instruments and we do
not anticipate any difficulties obtaining financial assurance instruments in the
future however in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding
letters of credit or thirdparty insurance coverage at reasonable cost or one
or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage we would
need to rely on other forms of

                                        11
page

financial assurance these types of financial assurance if available could be
more expensive to obtain which could negatively impact on our liquidity and
capital resources

  governmental regulations may restrict our operations or increase our costs of
  operations

     stringent government regulations at the federal state and local level in
the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business a large
number of complex laws rules orders and interpretations govern environmental
protection health safety land use zoning transportation and related
matters among other things they may restrict our operations and adversely
affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows by imposing
conditions such as

      limitations on the siting and construction of new waste disposal
       transfer or processing facilities or the expansion of existing
       facilities

      limitations and regulations on collection and disposal prices rates and
       volumes

      limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of outofstate waste
       or certain categories of waste or

      mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste

     regulations also affect the siting design and closure of landfills and
could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities curtail
operations or close a landfill temporarily or permanently future changes in
these regulations may require us to modify supplement or replace equipment or
facilities the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial

     in order to develop expand or operate a landfill or other waste management
facility we must have various facility permits and other governmental
approvals including those relating to zoning environmental protection and land
use

  our accounting policies concerning unamortized capitalized expenditures could
  result in a material charge against our earnings

     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize
certain expenditures and advances relating to acquisitions pending
acquisitions and disposal site development and expansion projects we expense
indirect acquisition costs such as executive salaries general corporate
overhead public affairs and other corporate services as incurred our policy
is to charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and
advances relating to any facility or operation that is permanently shut down
any pending acquisition that is not consummated and any disposal site
development or expansion project that is not completed the charge against
earnings is reduced by any portion of the capitalized expenditure and advances
that we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise in future
periods we may be required to incur charges against earnings in accordance with
our policy depending on the magnitude any such charges could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations

  the development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal and
  wastetoenergy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full
  capacity

     our customers utilize alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling
and composting in addition state and local governments mandate recycling and
waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of
wastes such as yard wastes at landfills or wastetoenergy facilities
although such mandates can be a very useful tool to protect our environment
these developments could reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and
wastetoenergy facilities in certain areas which may affect our ability to
operate our landfills and wastetoenergy facilities at full capacity as well
as the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and wastetoenergy
services

  our business is seasonal in nature and our revenues and results vary from
  quarter to quarter

     our operating revenues are usually lower in the winter months primarily
because the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities
usually increases in the spring and summer months and the

                                        12
page

volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate
usually decreases during the winter months our first and fourth quarter results
of operations typically reflect this seasonality in addition particularly
harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of
our operations

  fluctuations in commodity prices affect our operating revenues

     our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials such
as paper plastics aluminum and other commodities all of which are subject to
significant price fluctuations additionally there may be significant price
fluctuations in the price of methane gas electricity and other energyrelated
products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery
wastetoenergy and ipp operations these fluctuations may affect our future
operating income and cash flows

  we face uncertainties relating to pending litigation and investigations

     on three different occasions during july and august 1999 we lowered our
expected earnings per share for the three months ended june 30 1999 more than
30 lawsuits that claim to be based on our 1999 announcements have been filed
against us and some of our current and former officers and directors these
lawsuits which have been consolidated into one action assert various claims
under the federal securities laws including claims that i the projections we
made about our june 30 1999 earnings were false and misleading ii we failed
to disclose information about our earnings projections that would have been
important to purchasers of our stock iii we made further misrepresentations
after july 29 1999 about our operations and finances resulting in our company
taking a pretax charge of 176 billion in the third quarter of 1999 and iv
we made false or misleading representations in the registration statement and
prospectus filed with the sec in connection with the wm holdings merger the
plaintiffs also claim that certain of our current and former officers and
directors sold their common stock during times when they knew the price was
artificially inflated by the alleged misstatements and omissions

     on november 7 2001 we announced that we had reached a settlement
agreement with plaintiffs in this case resolving all claims against us and the
other defendants arising from or related to the allegations in the litigation
under the settlement agreement which is subject to approval by the court we
will pay 457 million to certain purchasers or acquirers of our securities
during the period from june 11 1998 through november 9 1999 and will present
and recommend to our stockholders a binding resolution to require that all of
our directors are elected annually the court has scheduled a hearing to
determine the fairness of the settlement agreement for may 10 2002 however we
are unable to determine the outcome of the hearing that the court will hold
regarding whether the settlement is fair reasonable and adequate additionally
if the settlement is approved there may be an appeal of that approval finally
it is uncertain how many class members will request to be excluded from the
class and whether that number will be large enough to trigger a provision in the
settlement agreement that would allow termination of the agreement

     other lawsuits relating to the facts described above and the february 1998
restatements by wm holdings of its priorperiod financial statements including
purported class actions have been filed against wm holdings and us these
include lawsuits by individuals who purchased our stock or stock of wm holdings
sold businesses or assets to us or wm holdings or held their stock allegedly in
reliance on statements we made for a more detailed discussion of our current
litigation see note 20 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated
financial statements included in this report

     we and our subsidiaries are also currently involved in other civil
litigation and governmental proceedings in the ordinary course of our business
we cannot predict or determine the outcome or resolution of all of the
proceedings brought against us in addition the timing of the final resolutions
to these matters is uncertain the possible outcomes or resolutions to these
matters or any new litigation or governmental proceedings could include
judgments against us or settlements either of which could require substantial
payments by us and thus could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition results of operations and cash flows

                                        13

  intense competition could reduce our profitability

     we encounter intense competition from governmental quasigovernmental and
private sources in all aspects of our operations in north america the industry
consists of several large national waste management companies and local and
regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources we compete with
these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their
own waste collection and disposal operations these counties and municipalities
may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues and taxexempt
financing are available to them also such governmental units may attempt to
impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive
advantage in addition competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales
volume or to win competitively bid municipal contracts

  we face potential difficulties implementing our new organization plan and
  managing our past growth

     in march 2002 we announced our plan to adopt a new organizational
structure this structure changes the way in which our field operations are set
up and reduces the staffing levels in the field the new structure aligns the
decisionmaking staff support and operations of the field operations with
metropolitan statistical areas that closely parallel the generation transport
and movement of solid waste in the united states we believe that the new
structure will improve our business by optimizing our resources assets and
people to lower our cost structure and add value for our stockholders however
there can be no assurance that implementation of our plan will be without
disruption to our operations or that the new structure will result in the
benefits anticipated

     additionally we made a number of acquisitions in past years some of them
substantial and continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities our
future financial results and prospects depend in part on our ability to
successfully manage and improve the operating efficiencies and productivity of
the operations acquired in particular whether the anticipated benefits of our
acquired operations are ultimately achieved will depend on a number of factors
including our ability to achieve administrative cost savings rationalization of
collection routes insurance and bonding cost reductions general economies of
scale and our ability generally to capitalize on our asset base and strategic
position our acquisitions also involve the potential risk that we failed to
accurately assess all of the preexisting liabilities of the companies acquired

  efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could divert management
  attention and increase our operating expenses

     labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees and these
efforts will likely continue in the future certain groups of our employees have
chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining
agreements with some of the groups we cannot predict which if any groups of
employees may seek union representation in the future or the outcome of
collective bargaining the negotiation of these agreements could divert
management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net
income if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining
agreements we might have to wait through cooling off periods which are often
followed by unioninitiated work stoppages including strikes depending on the
type and duration of such work stoppage our operating expenses could increase
significantly

  fluctuations in fuel costs could affect our operating expenses and results

     the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on
events outside our control including geopolitical developments supply and
demand for oil and gas actions by opec and other oil and gas producers war and
unrest in oil producing countries regional production patterns and
environmental concerns fuel is needed to run our collection and transfer
trucks and any price escalations or reductions in supply could increase our
operating expenses and have a negative impact on our consolidated financial
condition results of operations and cash flows we have implemented a fuel
surcharge to partially offset increased fuel costs however we are not always
able to pass through all of the increased fuel costs due to the terms of certain
customers contracts

  we face risks relating to general economic conditions

     we face risks related to general economic and market conditions including
the potential impact of the status of the economy and interest rate
fluctuations we also face risks related to other adverse external economic
conditions such as the ability of our insurers to timely meet their commitments
and the effect that significant claims or litigation against insurance companies
may have on such ability any negative general economic conditions could
materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operation and
cash flows

  we may need additional capital if our cash flow is less than expected

     we currently expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to
cover our anticipated cash needs for capital expenditures acquisitions and
other cash expenditures however we recently announced a stock buy back program
of up to 1 billion annually and we expect to fund the settlement of our
stockholder class action lawsuit in july 2002 if our cash flow from operations
is less than currently expected or our capital requirements increase either
due to strategic decisions or otherwise or if we buy back stock such that our
available cash is reduced we may elect to incur further indebtedness or issue
equity securities to cover any additional capital needs however we cannot
guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining additional capital on
acceptable or favorable terms

     our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial ratios
if our cash flows are less than expected or our capital or other cash
requirements are more than expected we may not be in compliance with the
ratios this would result in a default under our credit agreements if there
were a default we may not be able to get waivers or amendments to our credit
facilities and the lenders could choose to declare all outstanding borrowings
due and payable if that happened there can be no assurances that we could
fully repay the amounts due or obtain a waiver of such default or timely obtain
alternative financing since we are partially dependent on our credit facilities
to fund borrowing and bonding needs any default could have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operation and cash
flows

  we may encounter difficulties deploying our enterprise software

     we have recently deployed enterprisewide software systems that replaced
our previous financial human resources and payroll systems these systems may
initially contain errors or cause other problems that could adversely affect or
even temporarily disrupt all or a portion of our operations until resolved









item 2  properties

     our principal executive offices are in houston texas where we lease
approximately 400000 square feet under leasing arrangements expiring at various
times through 2010 we also have us fieldbased administrative offices in
california illinois pennsylvania new hampshire and georgia and a fieldbased
administrative office in ontario canada

     our principal property and equipment consist of land primarily landfills
transfer stations and bases for collection operations buildings waste
treatment or processing facilities other than landfills and vehicles and
equipment we own or lease real property in most locations where we have
operations we have operations in each of the fifty states other than montana
and wyoming we also have operations in the district of columbia puerto rico
and throughout canada

     at december 31 2001 of the 302 company operated landfills we owned or
operated through lease agreements 253 active sites in north america these sites
control approximately 134000 acres of land including approximately 33000
permitted acres and approximately 6000 acres we consider to be probable
expansion acreage for landfill use additionally we operate 49 landfills
through contractual agreements primarily with municipalities at december 31
2001 in north america we operated approximately 300 transfer stations over 190
mrfs and 18 secondary processing facilities we also owned or operated through
agreements 16 wastetoenergy facilities and eight ipps in north america as of
december 31 2001

adequately maintained and adequate for our current operations however we
expect to continue to make investments in additional equipment and property for
expansion for replacement of assets and in connection with future
acquisitions for more information see the managements discussion and

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

     below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december
31 2001 this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate
results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty the company
discusses in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations in item 1 under the section factors influencing
future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements of this report this
discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the
consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial
statements

  critical accounting estimates and assumptions

     as further discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in
preparing our financial statements we make several estimates and assumptions
that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and
expenses however the most difficult subjective and complex estimates and the
assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty are related to
our accounting for landfills and environmental liabilities

     landfill airspace amortization and finalclosurepostclosure costs  we
expense amounts for landfill airspace usage and landfill final closure and
postclosure costs for each ton of waste accepted for disposal at our landfills
in determining the amount to expense for each ton of waste accepted we estimate
the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity and the total
final closure and postclosure costs for each landfill site our engineers also
estimate the tonnage capacity of the landfill the expense for each ton is then
calculated based on the total costs remaining and the total remaining tonnage
capacity estimates for projected landfill site costs and for final closure and
postclosure costs are developed using input from the companys engineers and
accountants and are reviewed by management typically at least once per year
the estimates for landfill final closure and postclosure costs also consider
when the costs would actually be paid and factor in where appropriate
inflation and discount rates

     as of december 31 2001 and 2000 the net book value recorded for
capitalized landfill site costs was 47 billion and 49 billion respectively
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with
certainty we expect to incur 71 billion related to future construction
activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites the
future costs will be capitalized as incurred and expensed over the useful lives
of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed the average landfill airspace
amortization cost per ton for the 302 landfills operating at december 31 2001
was 370 per ton as compared to 384 for the 305 landfills at december 31
2000 as of december 31 2001 and 2000 we had recorded landfill final closure
and postclosure liabilities of 625 million and 613 million respectively
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with
certainty we estimate that the aggregate cost of landfill final closure and
postclosure as of december 31 2001 is approximately 24 billion additional
closure and postclosure costs in excess of those recorded at december 31 2001
will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the
total present value of estimated final closure and postclosure costs will be
fully accrued for each landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting
waste and is closed the average landfill final closure and postclosure
expense on a per ton basis for the 302 landfills operating at december 31
2001 was 024 per ton as compared to 030 for the 305 landfills at december
31 2000 this decrease in average landfill final closure and postclosure rates
from 2000 to 2001 was caused primarily by three facilities with significantly
higher than normal per ton amortization rates as these three facilities neared
closure in 2000 based on specific facts and circumstances we were required to
increase their final closure and postclosure rates in order to be adequately
accrued for final closure and postclosure at the time the landfills closed

     in determining the amounts to expense for airspace amortization and final
closure and postclosure costs our engineers estimate the unused permitted
airspace at each landfill we will also consider expansion airspace in our
estimate of available airspace when we believe the success of obtaining such an
airspace expansion is probable the criteria we use for evaluating the
probability of obtaining an expansion permit to landfill airspace at existing
sites are as follows

      personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local and state
       approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill
                                        18
page

      at the time the expansion is added to the permitted site life it is
       probable that the approvals will be received within the normal
       application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction
       in which the landfill is located

      either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or
       obtain land to be included in the expansion plan

      there are no significant known technical legal community business or
       political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of
       such expansion

      financial analysis has been completed and the results demonstrate that
       the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact and

      airspace and related costs including additional final closure and
       postclosure costs have been estimated based on conceptual design

     additionally to include airspace associated with an expansion effort the
expansion permit application must generally be expected to be submitted within
one year and the expansion permit must be expected to be received within two to
five years exceptions to these criteria must be approved through a
landfillspecific approval process that includes the approval from the chief
financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors
on a quarterly basis of the 105 landfills with probable expansions included in
the landfill airspace calculations at december 31 2001 27 probable landfill
expansions required the chief financial officer to approve an exception to the
criteria approximately twothirds of these exceptions were due to legal or
community issues that could impede the expansion process while the remaining
were primarily due to permit application processes beyond the oneyear limit
which in most cases were due to statespecific permitting procedures

     we have generally been successful in receiving approvals for expansions
pursued however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in
obtaining landfill expansions in the future in some cases we may be
unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an
expansion permit that we previously thought was probable becomes unlikely the
estimates and assumptions used in developing this information are reviewed by
our engineers and accountants at least annually and we believe them to be
reasonable however to the extent that such estimates or the assumptions used
to make those estimates prove to be incorrect or our belief that we will
receive an expansion permit changes to remote the costs incurred in the pursuit
of the expansion will be charged against earnings net of any capitalized
expenditures and advances that will be recoverable through sale or otherwise
additionally the landfills future operations will typically reflect lower
profitability due to higher amortization rates final closure and postclosure
rates and expenses related to the removal of previously included expansion
airspace the landfill may also become subject to impairment which could be
material to the results of operations of any individual reporting period

     environmental remediation liabilities  under current laws and
regulations we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our
operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a
particular site we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability
is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances cost estimates to
remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our
contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated
remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties share of
responsibility while the precise amount of these future remediation costs
cannot be determined with absolute certainty we have estimated that the
aggregate cost as of december 31 2001 is approximately 376 million as of
december 31 2001 and 2000
we had recorded liabilities of 321 million and 349 million respectively for
the present value of remediation costs of our sites

     our engineers and accountants also specifically review the estimates and
assumptions related to environmental remediation liabilities at least annually
in many circumstances the actual costs related to these liabilities which we
have estimated or assumed may not be known for decades into the future however
we believe that based on our extensive experience in the environmental services
business and the large number of sites we have dealt with we have the ability
to reasonably estimate our aggregate liability as additional information
becomes available estimates are adjusted as necessary it is possible that
technological regulatory

page

or enforcement developments the results of environmental studies the
nonexistence or inability of other potentially responsible third parties to
contribute to the settlements of such liabilities or other factors could prove
our estimates to be inaccurate necessitating the recording of additional
liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our financial
statements

  1999 accounting charges and adjustments

     in 1999 we initiated a comprehensive internal review of our accounting
records systems processes and controls at the direction of our board of
directors as discussed below and in note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements we experienced significant difficulty in the integration and
conversion of information and accounting systems after the wm holdings merger
which was accounted for as a pooling of interests as a result of these systems
and process issues and other issues raised during the 1999 accounting review
certain charges and adjustments were recorded as discussed below the review
was completed such that we were able to record related adjustments in our
financial statements for the quarter ended september 30 1999 the amounts we
recorded as a result of the review had a material effect on our financial
statements for the year ended december 31 1999

     the following is a summary of charges attributable to this review which
were recorded for the quarter ended september 30 1999 in millions

results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2001

  operating revenues

     our operating revenues in 2001 were 113 billion compared to 125
billion in 2000 and 131 billion in 1999 our revenues decreased in 2000 and
2001 primarily because we sold our international operations outside of north
america most of our nonsolid waste businesses and certain nonintegrated nasw
operations pursuant to our strategic plan as shown below nasw is our principal
reportable segment our other segment was reported in previous years as wm
international and nonsolid waste beginning in 1999 and continuing through
2000 and into 2001 we sold all operations that had previously been reported in
wm international and most of the operations that had been reported in nonsolid
waste

     our nasw operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
collection disposal and transfer station services a portion of the fees we
charge to our customers for collection services is billed in advance a
liability for future service is recorded upon receipt of payment and operating
revenues are recognized as services are actually provided revenues from our
disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on
the volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are
normally billed monthly or semimonthly fees charged at transfer stations are
based on the volume of waste deposited taking into account our cost of loading
transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site intercompany
revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements

     nasw revenues decreased by 208 million in 2001 from 2000 due primarily to
the sales of our nonintegrated nasw operations during 2000 and to a lesser
extent in 2001 additionally we experienced negative internal growth in our
nasw operations of 07 or 78 million in 2001 internal growth was negatively
impacted by declines in the prices of recyclable commodities of 15 or 161
million as well as lower volumes of 07 or 80 million compared to 2000 the
negative volume is largely attributable to the overall slowing of the north
american economy our terminating unprofitable accounts and the impact of our
policy change for third party brokers which required more stringent contract
requirements thereby resulting in the loss of some brokered waste also
contributing to the decline in nasw operating revenues were fluctuations in the
foreign currency exchange rate of the canadian dollar which reduced revenues by
20 million in addition in 2001 the company recognized negative fair market
value adjustments of 11 million for pulp and paper commodity derivatives with
enron as the counterparty these derivatives were intended to mitigate the price
risk associated with pulp and paper commodities that we process and sell to
third parties offsetting these revenue declines were the acquisition of certain
nasw operations in 2001 and the yearoveryear effect of acquisitions of nasw
operations in 2000

     our nasw operating revenues increased by 533 million in 2000 as compared
to 1999 mostly because we had internal growth in comparable operations we had a
14 or 150 million increase in revenues from pricing increases and a 25
or 267 million increase in revenues from volume increases during the first
half of 2000 the pricing in the recyclable materials markets favorably impacted
overall pricing increases but those improvements were offset by the significant
recyclable materials market downturn in the second half of 2000 additionally
we implemented a fuel surcharge in march 2000 to mitigate the significant
increase in the cost of fuel if we excluded the effects of the price increases
for recyclable materials and the fuel surcharge there was a price increase of
06 in 2000 compared to 1999 acquisitions of nasw businesses in 2000 and the
full year effect of acquisitions that were completed in 1999 increased nasw
operating revenue by 27 in 2000 as compared to 1999 but that increase was
offset by the sales of the nonintegrated nasw operations foreign currency
fluctuations with the canadian dollar also negatively impacted operating
revenues during 2000

  operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown
  below

     our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and
related taxes and benefits fuel maintenance and repairs of equipment and
facilities tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer
stations and accruals for future landfill final closure and postclosure costs
and environmental remediation certain direct landfill development expenditures
are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as
capacity is consumed and include acquisition engineering upgrading
construction capitalized interest and permitting costs all indirect expenses
such as administrative salaries and general corporate overhead are expensed in
the period incurred we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers
relating to environmentally related remedial defense and tort claim costs at a
number of our sites such recoveries are included in operating costs and
expenses as an offset to environmental expenses our operating costs and
expenses decreased 116 in 2001 as compared to 2000 and decreased 88 in 2000
as compared to 1999 as a percentage of operating revenues operating costs and
expenses decreased from 630 in 1999 to 604 in 2000 and decreased again to
589 in 2001

     the yeartoyear decline in operating costs and expenses between 1999 and
2001 was primarily caused by the sales of our wm international nonsolid waste
and nonintegrated nasw operations these sales
                                        25
page

occurred throughout 2000 and into 2001 adding to the decrease was the effect of
the volume declines in 2001 as compared to 2000 as described in the discussion
of nasw operating revenues

     as a percentage of revenues operating costs and expenses were
exceptionally high in 1999 because of the difficulties we had integrating
operations after the wm holdings merger in 2000 operating costs and expenses
decreased as we started improving our procurement practices and developing more
standardized operating procedures although the decrease as a percentage of
revenue was not as great due to the decrease in revenues in the same period our
improvements continued and caused further decreases in operating costs and
expenses into 2001 additionally in 2001 we implemented market strategy and
procurement initiatives as well as other cost saving initiatives such as
preventative maintenance programs that created an overall reduction in repair
and maintenance costs finally in 2001 we aggressively pursued our claims
against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses recovering
approximately 105 million in 2001 as compared to 2 million in 2000 and 7
million in 1999 these recoveries of environmental expenses are recorded as an
offset to operating costs and expenses if we excluded the insurance recoveries
operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues were unaffected in 1999
and 2000 and would have been 598 in 2001

     as part of our ongoing operations we review our requirements for
remediation and other environmental liabilities based on an analysis of among
other things the regulatory context surrounding landfills sitespecific
environmental issues and remaining airspace capacity in light of changes to
operational efficiencies accordingly revisions to remediation liability
requirements may result in upward or downward adjustments to income from
operations in any given period adjustments for final closure and postclosure
estimates are accounted for prospectively over the remaining capacity of the
operating landfill there was no impact on operating costs and expenses as a
percentage of revenues for revisions to remedial environmental and similar
liabilities in 2001 or 2000 and there was a decrease of 05 in 1999

  selling general and administrative expenses

     our selling general and administrative expenses include management
salaries clerical and administrative costs professional services facility
rentals provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs as well as
costs related to our marketing and sales force

     our selling general and administrative expenses decreased 182 million or
95 in 2000 compared to 1999 and decreased 116 million or 67 in 2001
compared to 2000 as a percentage of operating revenues our selling general
and administrative expenses were 143 for 2001 139 for 2000 and 146 for
1999

     the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in 2001 as
compared to 2000 is due mostly to the divestitures that we completed throughout
2000 in addition as discussed below we had significant costs in 2000 related
to accounting and process improvement initiatives these costs were not as
significant in 2001 as we were able to stabilize our accounting systems and
substantially complete our process improvement initiatives in the second half of
2000 offsetting these decreases were costs related to corporate staffing
increases which began primarily in 2000 and continued in 2001

     in 2000 we incurred significant costs for our process improvement
initiatives and the accounting assistance that began as part of our 1999
accounting review these costs were mainly in the first half of 2000 because by
the second half of 2000 we had stabilized our accounting systems and completed
our process improvement initiatives which significantly reduced our ongoing
need for these services in 2000 we incurred approximately 196 million for
professional accounting and process improvement consulting services and
consulting services related to the implementation of new enterprise information
systems approximately 51 million related to our divestitures improvements to
our billing systems and verification of our customer base and legal fees
related to certain stockholder litigation and other sec matters was also
recorded in 2000 however in 2000 we were successful in collecting certain
accounts that were reserved for in 1999 favorably impacting our provision for
bad debt in 2000 which decreased from 268 million in 1999 to 14 million in
2000 we also experienced permanent staffing increases at our corporate office
throughout 2000 particularly in the area of information systems and corporate
accounting and finance

     selling general and administrative expenses for 1999 included 403 million
in adjustments resulting from the 1999 accounting review some of which are
recurring in nature and should be expected in future periods these significant
adjustments include an increase of 168 million relative to the allowance for
doubtful accounts and 63 million in costs for insurance adjustments
accounting legal and other professional services these costs were primarily
related to litigation and investigations we conducted in 1999 in connection with
the announcements of our lower expectations for earnings per share in july and
august 1999 additionally our administrative costs in 1999 particularly in the
third and fourth quarters were exceptionally high due to the increased costs to
perform administrative functions attributable to our integration problems after
the wm holdings merger

  depreciation and amortization

     depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of goodwill on a
straightline basis over a period of 40 years or less commencing on the dates
of the respective acquisitions ii amortization of other intangible assets on
a straightline basis from 3 to 40 years iii depreciation of property and
equipment on a straightline basis from 3 to 50 years and iv amortization of
landfill costs on a unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed
over the estimated remaining capacity of a site

     depreciation and amortization expense decreased 41 in 2001 as compared to
2000 and decreased 115 in 2000 as compared to 1999 as a percentage of
operating revenues depreciation and amortization expense was 121 in 2001
114 in 2000 and 123 in 1999

     the decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2001 is attributable to
the amortization expense of goodwill on operations that were divested throughout
2000 more costeffective use of our landfill assets in 2001 and a temporary
increase in fully depreciated trucks and other equipment associated with delays
in receiving new equipment in the first half of 2001

     as a percentage of operating revenues depreciation and amortization
expense decreased in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily because of the full year
suspension of depreciation in 2000 on fixed assets which were heldforsale the
depreciation suspension for 2000 for these heldforsale operations prior to
those operations being sold was 99 million or 08 of operating revenues the
depreciation suspended in 1999 for operations heldforsale which all occurred
in the fourth quarter of 1999 was 46 million or 03 of operating revenue
however the decreases in depreciation and amortization expense were partially
offset by increased landfill airspace amortization in 2000 due to increases in
disposal volumes at our landfills we also experienced higher airspace
amortization expense in 2000 as compared to the prior years due to higher
airspace amortization rates as a result of our more stringent criteria for
evaluating the probability of obtaining airspace expansions which was effective
starting in the third quarter of 1999 included in depreciation and amortization
expense for 1999 are adjustments resulting from the 1999 accounting review
these adjustments primarily included adjustments to increases to landfill
amortization expenses as a result of the comprehensive review of the nasw
landfill expansion projects

  merger and acquisition related costs asset impairments and unusual items

     in 2001 2000 and 1999 we had significant charges related to merger and
acquisition related costs asset impairments and unusual items in 1999 these
were charges that we identified during our 1999 accounting review or that
resulted from our losses from businesses sold and heldforsale adjustments for
businesses to be sold in 2000 these costs were primarily due to our sale of
our international operations outside of north america and the termination of wm
holdings defined benefit pension plan which are more fully described in notes
2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements

     in 2001 expenses included in this category were primarily attributable to
the agreement that was reached to settle the stockholder class action lawsuit
filed against us in july 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities laws
which net of the recovery from the stockholders derivative suit against the
companys auditor resulted in a charge of 374 million the settlement of the
class action which is subject to court approval provides for our payment to
the class of 457 million we believe the payment which is expected to be made
in the second half of 2002 will result in a net cash outflow of approximately
230 to 240 million after
                                        27
page

considering insurance tax deductions and related settlement costs in addition
we recorded a heldforsale adjustment of approximately 15 million related to
our international operations outside of north america along with a heldforsale
adjustment for an investment in an operation in mexico of approximately 28
million offsetting this expense was a net gain of 24 million comprised of the
reversal of the heldforsale impairment of 109 million and a heldforuse
impairment of 85 million from our decision during the third quarter of 2001
not to sell all but one of our ipps and the reclassification in the third
quarter of 2001 of all but one of our ipps from heldforsale to heldforuse
also included in asset impairments and unusual items for 2001 are reversals of
certain loss contract reserves of 13 million that we determined to be in excess
of current requirements and other unusual items

  interest expense

     our interest expense decreased in 2001 and 2000 as compared to 1999 because
we paid down debt throughout 2000 and 2001 with proceeds from our divestitures
and our cash flows from operations in addition contributing to the decrease
was a 39 million offset to interest expense for interest rate swaps we used to
manage our interest rate exposure partially offsetting the overall decrease in
interest expense was a decrease in capitalized interest recorded from period to
period due to an overall decrease in interest rates we capitalized interest of
16 million 22 million and 34 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

  provision for income taxes

     we recorded a provision for income taxes of 284 million 418 million and
232 million for 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively resulting in an effective
income tax rate of 361 1302 and 1423 for each of the three years
respectively the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal
statutory rate and reported income taxes for these years is primarily due to
state and local income taxes nondeductible costs related to acquired
intangibles nondeductible costs associated with the impairment and divestiture
of certain businesses and other charges and adjustments related to the 1999
accounting review as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements and the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain
foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested additionally in
2001 scheduled canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a
benefit of 42 million which was offset in part by an expense of 24 million
related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed
permanently invested in canada the nonrecurring 42 million benefit arising
from the change in canadian tax rates resulted in a 53 reduction in the
companys overall effective income tax rate in 2001

liquidity and capital resources

     the company operates in a capital intensive business and continuing access
to various financing sources is vital to our operations in the past we have
been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we
consider attractive and we expect to continue to maintain access to capital
sources in the future there are several key factors considered by credit rating
agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access
to financing these factors include

      the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse
       customer base

      our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows

                                        28

      our asset base and

      our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and
       disciplined capital allocation

     in addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations we have
capital requirements for i capital expenditures for construction and expansion
of landfill sites as well as new trucks and equipment for collection
operations ii refurbishments and improvements at wastetoenergy facilities
and iii business acquisitions for 2002 we currently expect to spend
approximately 13 billion for capital expenditures and approximately 250
million for the purchases of businesses the following table summarizes our
contractual obligations as of december 31 2001 in millions and the
anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years

a  these contractual obligations do not include our accounts payable and
     accrued liabilities other than environmental liabilities which we expect
     to be paid in 2002 nor do they include other longterm liabilities which
     we generally expect to be settled over the next several years

     our strategy is to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations first
from internally generated funds historically we have also when appropriate
obtained financing from issuing debt and common stock

     the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the
years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 in millions

     in 1999 cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by our
integration efforts in connection with the wm holdings merger and the merger
with eastern environmental services inc eastern the eastern merger
which both occurred in 1998 and the subsequent operational and administrative
difficulties we had in 1999 we spent approximately 13 billion on acquisitions
of businesses and approximately 13 billion on capital expenditures we funded
these investing activities with cash flows from operations net debt borrowings
of approximately 259 million other net financing activities of 167 million
and proceeds from sales of assets of approximately 651 million

     in 2000 we spent 231 million to acquire businesses 13 billion in
capital expenditures and 33 billion on net debt reductions we financed these
cash expenditures primarily with 21 billion of cash flows from operations and
26 billion of proceeds from our divestitures a tax refund of approximately
200 million and our improvements in accounts receivable average days sale
outstanding favorably impacted cash flows from operations in 2000

     in 2001 we generated cash flows from operations of approximately 24
billion favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of 59
million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against
certain insurance carriers and 64 million that we received from counterparties
when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled
maturities included in our investing activities was 13 billion of capital
expenditures and 116 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses

                                        29

these expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other
investing activities of 212 million in addition we used 485 million for
financing activities which is comprised of 510 million of net debt reductions
and 25 million of other financing activities offset by proceeds of 50 million
from exercises of common stock options and warrants and other financing
activities

     the following summary of free cash flows has been prepared to highlight and
facilitate understanding of the primary cash flow elements it is not intended

a  ebitda is defined herein as income from operations excluding depreciation
     and amortization and asset impairments and unusual items ebitda is not a
     measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting
     principles but we have provided it here because we understand that such
     information is used by certain investors when analyzing our financial
     position and performance

     on june 29 2001 we replaced our prior bank credit facilities with a 750
million syndicated line of credit the line of credit and a 1750 million
syndicated revolving credit facility the revolver the line of credit
requires annual renewal by the lender and if it is not renewed we have the
option of converting the balance outstanding if any as of june 28 2002 into a
oneyear term loan the revolver matures in june 2006 as of december 31 2001
we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of 16 billion of which
approximately 15 billion are issued under our revolver that generally have
terms allowing automatic renewal after a year at december 31 2001 and march 8
2002 we had unused and available credit capacity under the bank credit
facilities of approximately 994 million and 950 billion respectively

                                        30

     in february 2001 we issued 600 million of 7 38 senior unsecured notes
due august 1 2010 interest is payable semiannually on february 1 and august
1 the net proceeds from the offering of the notes were approximately 593
million after deducting discounts to the underwriters and expenses we used the
net proceeds from this offering together with cash from operations to repay
600 million of senior notes that matured during the second quarter of 2001

     in march 2001 we worked with local governmental authorities to refinance
339 million of fixedrate taxexempt bonds maturing through 2008 with 326
million of variablerate taxexempt bonds maturing through 2011 and 17 million
of fixedrate bonds maturing through 2001 the new borrowings include 4 million
of related financing costs we recorded a net extraordinary loss of 1 million
in the first quarter of 2001 for the remaining unamortized premium and issuance
costs related to the retired debt

     in november 2001 we issued 400 million of 6 12 senior unsecured notes
due november 15 2008 interest on the notes is payable semiannually on may 15
and november 15 the net proceeds from the offering after deducting discounts
to the underwriters and expenses were approximately 396 million

     in the fourth quarter of 2001 we repurchased 108 million of our 4
convertible subordinated notes due february 1 2002 at the maturity date we
redeemed the remaining 427 million outstanding primarily using cash obtained
from the november 2001 6 12 senior note issuance

     on july 17 1998 we issued 600 million of 6 18 mandatorily tendered
senior notes due july 15 2011 the notes were subject to certain mandatory
tender features as described in the indenture which allowed us to repurchase
all of the outstanding notes on july 15 2001 we used available cash on hand
along with funds from the line of credit to repurchase the notes in july 2001
during the third quarter of 2001 we recorded an extraordinary loss of
approximately 1 million net of taxes for the retirement of this debt

     in addition we have 300 million of 6625 senior notes due july 15 2002
2857 million of 77 senior notes due october 1 2002 and 350 million of 65
senior notes due december 15 2002 we have classified these borrowings as
longterm at december 31 2001 based upon our ability to use our line of credit
andor revolver which are both considered longterm facilities to refinance
these borrowings we intend to pursue other sources of longterm financing to
refinance these borrowings however in the event other sources of longterm
financing are not available we have the intent and ability to use our line of
credit andor revolver

     at december 31 2001 we had interest rate swap agreements with third
parties with a notional amount of 18 billion these agreements were
established to manage the interest rate risk of our senior note obligations and
at december 31 2001 these interest rate swap agreements had a net negative
fair value of 2 million under the hedge method of accounting for these types
of derivatives the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements is
recorded as either a risk management asset or liability with an offsetting
adjustment to the carrying value of the longterm debt which is the hedged
instrument our reported longterm debt does not include such an adjustment at
december 31 2000 since we adopted the statement of financial accounting
standards 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
of january 1 2001

     in early october we elected to terminate certain of our interest rate swap
agreements and we received cash of 72 million which is comprised of 64
million for the fair value of the swaps that were terminated and 8 million for
interest expense offsets previously accrued for settlements from the
counterparties under the hedge method of accounting for these types of
derivatives the unamortized adjustment to longterm debt for these terminated
swaps of 60 million at december 31 2001 remains in longterm debt and will be
amortized until the maturity of the related senior note obligation the interest
rate risk of which the hedge was established to manage approximately 16
million of this adjustment to longterm debt will be amortized as an offset to
interest expense in 2002

     in november 2001 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to
settle the class action lawsuits filed against us in july 1999 alleging
violations of the federal securities laws under the settlement agreement which
is subject to court approval we agreed to pay 457 million to the class we
expect our net cash outflow after considering insurance tax deductions and
related settlement costs to be approximately 230 to 240 million the
settlement will most likely be paid in the second half of 2002 with a minimal
level of additional borrowing necessary to fund the settlement

     in february 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved a
stock buy back program under the program we will buy back up to 1 billion of
our common stock each year the purchases will be made in open market purchases
or privately negotiated transactions using cash flow from operations

special purpose entities

     on june 30 2000 two limited liability companies llcs were established
to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three of our
wastetoenergy facilities john hancock life insurance company hancock has
995 ownership in one of the llcs the second llc is 995 collectively owned
by hancock and the cit group cit we have a 05 interest in both llcs
hancock and cit made an initial investment of approximately 167 million in the
llcs under the llc agreements the llcs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence
of any of the following events i a written decision of all the members of the
llcs to dissolve the llcs ii december 31 2063 iii the entry of a decree
of judicial dissolution under the delaware limited liability company act or
iv the llcs cease to own any interest in these wastetoenergy facilities
additionally income losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based
on their initial capital account balances until hancock and cit achieve targeted
returns thereafter the amounts will be allocated 20 to hancock and cit and
80 to us we do not expect hancock and cit to achieve the targeted returns in
2002 we account for the underlying leases as operating leases the remaining
aggregate lease commitments are 400 million related to these wastetoenergy
facilities

     under the llc agreements if we exercise certain renewal options under the
leases we will be required to make capital contributions to the llcs for the
difference if any between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents
we are required under certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the
llcs in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss amounts and
termination values under the llc agreements to the extent they are different
from the underlying lease agreements we believe that the occurrence of these
circumstances is remote

     we are the manager of the llcs but there are significant limitations on the
powers of the manager per the llc agreements accordingly we account for our
interest in the llcs under the equity method of accounting these investments
have a carrying value of approximately 1 million at both december 31 2001 and
2000 respectively if we were required to consolidate the llcs we would record
approximately 425 million in assets and 221 million of debt as of december
31 2001 the remaining balance which would be recorded is primarily minority
interest during 2001 and 2000 the llc received lease payments of 63 million
and 35 million respectively from the three wastetoenergy facilities and made
distributions during the same periods to members of the llcs of 13 million and
11 million respectively

seasonality and inflation

     our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months
which corresponds with our first and fourth quarters this is mostly because i
the volume of construction and demolition waste is lower in the winter because
there is less construction activity and ii the volume of industrial and
residential waste in certain regions where the company operates tends to
decrease during the winter months

     we do not believe that inflation has nor do we expect it to have any
material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future

new accounting pronouncements

     in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards no 141 accounting for business combinations
sfas no 141 and statement of financial accounting standards no 142
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 sfas no
141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and prohibits the poolingofinterests method for business
combinations initiated after june 30 2001 according to sfas no 142 goodwill
that arises from purchases after june 30 2001 cannot be amortized in addition
sfas no 142 requires the continuation of the amortization of goodwill and all
intangible assets through december 31 2001 but provides that amortization of
existing goodwill will cease on
                                        32
page

january 1 2002 entities must use their current goodwill impairment approach
through december 31 2001 and begin to apply the new impairment approach on
january 1 2002 sfas no 142 requires a twostep impairment approach for
goodwill companies must first determine whether goodwill is impaired and if so
they must value that impairment based on the amount by which the book value
exceeds the estimated fair value companies have six months from the date they
initially apply sfas no 142 to test goodwill for impairment and any impairment
charge resulting from the initial application of the new rule must be classified
as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle thereafter
goodwill should be tested for impairment annually and impairment losses should
be presented in the operating section of the income statement unless they are
associated with a discontinued operation in those cases any impairment losses

     during 2001 all of our business combinations were accounted for by using
the purchase method of accounting in accordance with our adoption of sfas no
141 we will continue to use the purchase method of accounting for our business
combinations in accordance with sfas no 142 we have not amortized goodwill
from any acquisitions that occurred after june 30 2001 we have no intangible
assets other than goodwill that will cease being amortized upon adoption of
sfas 142 we have recalculated our basic and diluted earnings per share for
2001 2000 and 1999 excluding goodwill amortization as follows dollars in

     the effect of adopting sfas no 141 will also require us to writeoff net
negative goodwill of approximately 2 million which will be recorded as a
credit to cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle in the first
quarter of 2002 in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill is required to be
tested for impairment at the reporting unit which is defined as a companys
operating segment or one level below the operating segment for the purposes of
applying sfas no 142 we have defined our reporting units to be our six
individual nasw areas and our nasw recycling operations that are not included in
any of our nasw areas although we currently expect no impairment of goodwill
upon the initial adoption of sfas no 142 there can be no assurance that
goodwill will not be impaired upon the initial adoption of sfas no 142 or at
any time subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 142

     in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations sfas no 143 sfas no 143 covers all legally enforceable
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and
provides the accounting and reporting requirements for such obligations sfas
no 143 is effective for us beginning january 1 2003 our management has not
yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 143 will have on our
consolidated financial statements

     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement
of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 which supersedes statement of
financial accounting standards no 121 accounting for the impairment of
longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of sfas no 144
establishes a single accounting method for longlived assets to be disposed of
by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired and extends the
presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions
sfas no 144 also requires that an impairment loss be recognized for assets
heldforuse when the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable
the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum
of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset group excluding interest charges estimates of
future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a longlived asset group
must incorporate the entitys own assumptions about its use of the asset group
and must factor in all available evidence sfas no 144 is effective for us on
january 1 2002 as of december 31 2001 the primary components within our
operations heldforsale were certain nonsolid waste operations certain nasw
operations and our surplus real estate portfolio upon adoption of sfas no 144
any heldforsale operations that do not meet sfas no 144 criteria must be
classified as heldforuse we expect 14 million of heldforsale assets to not
meet sfas no 144 criteria these assets will be reclassified to heldforuse in
the first quarter of 2002 this reclassification will have no earnings impact



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

     in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk including
changes in interest rates certain commodity prices and certain equity prices
from time to time we and certain of our subsidiaries use derivatives to manage
some portion of these risks our derivatives are simple agreements with
independent third parties that provide for payments based on the notional
amount with no multipliers or leverage as of december 31 2001 all of the
derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions
with the exception of two derivatives related to the pulp and paper commodity
markets that were entered into for trading purposes we are exposed to credit
risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivatives however
we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and
the credit worthiness of the counterparties all of whom we either consider
credit worthy or who have issued letters of credit to support their credit
worthiness see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion
on the handling of the enron north america corp enron waste paper swap
agreements

     we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes
will affect the fair value of our companys market risk sensitive derivatives
and related positions this analysis is inherently limited because it represents
a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market movements may vary
significantly from our assumptions the effects of market movements may also
directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not
covered by sensitivity analysis fair value sensitivity is not necessarily
indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed
market rate movements

     interest rate exposure  our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations which are mainly
denominated in us dollars in addition we generally use interest rate swaps
to either lockin or limit the variability in the interest expense of certain
floating rate debt obligations or to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate
debt obligations an instantaneous one percentage point increase in interest
rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair
value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at december 31 2001
and 2000 by approximately 394 million and 403 million respectively this
analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on
other items such as new borrowings nor the favorable impact they would have on
interest expense and cash payments for interest since a significant portion of
our debt is at fixed rates changes in market interest rates would not
significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt
would need to be refinanced at maturity

     commodities price exposure  we market recycled paper products like old
newspaper onp and old corrugated containers occ we started entering
into financial swaps in 1999 in an effort to mitigate the risk of recyclable
paper price fluctuations under these financial swap agreements we generally
transfer a
                                        34
page

floating market price for a fixed price for a fixed period of time we and the
counterparty agree to use a market index as an indicator of the market price
during the term of the swap at december 31 2001 all except two of our waste
paper swap agreements were with enron due to enrons financial situation
collectibility of the funds associated with these instruments is not probable at
december 31 2001 and therefore these instruments were estimated to have no fair
value the derivatives with enron were subsequently terminated in early 2002
the net fair value of two derivatives entered into for trading purposes was 7
thousand at december 31 2001 and therefore not material

     equity price exposure  we are also subject to equity price exposure from
our debt issues that are convertible into our own common stock these debt
issues had an aggregate carrying value of 458 million and 566 million as of
december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively an instantaneous ten percent decrease
in our stock price on december 31 2001 and 2000 would decrease the fair value
to a third party holder of our convertible debt by approximately 1 million and
11 million respectively the exposure at december 31 2001 has been
substantially reduced due to the maturity and our payment of 427 million to
redeem our 4 convertible subordinated notes due on february 1 2002

     see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion
of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

     below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december
31 2000 this discussion should be read together with the consolidated
financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements

     when we use words like may believes expects anticipates
should estimate project plan their opposites and similar
expressions the company is making forwardlooking statements these expressions
are most often used in statements relating to business plans strategies
anticipated benefits or projections about the anticipated revenues earnings or
other aspects of our operating results we make these statements in an effort to
keep stockholders and the public informed about our business and have based
them on our current expectations about future events you should view such
statements with caution these statements are not guarantees of future
performance or events as noted elsewhere in this report all phases of our
business are subject to uncertainties risks and other influences many of which
the company has no control over additionally any of these factors either
alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on the company and
could change whether any forwardlooking statement ultimately turns out to be
true

     outlined below are some of the risks that the company faces and that could
affect our business and financial statements for 2001 and beyond however they
are not the only risks that the company faces there may be additional risks
that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial which
could also impair our business for more information see the factors
influencing future results and accuracy of forward looking statements section
of this report

      the outcome of litigation or investigations

      possible changes in our estimates of site remediation requirements final
       closure and postclosure obligations compliance and other audits and
       regulatory developments

      the possible impact of regulations on our business including the cost to
       comply with regulatory requirements and the potential liabilities
       associated with disposal operations as well as our ability to obtain and
       maintain permits needed to operate our facilities

      the effect of limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of
       outofstate waste or certain categories of waste

      our ability to improve the productivity of acquired operations and use
       our asset base and strategic position to operate more efficiently

      our ability to accurately assess all of the preexisting liabilities of
       companies we have acquired and to successfully integrate the operations
       of acquired companies with our existing operations

      possible charges against earnings for certain shut down operations and
       uncompleted acquisitions or development or expansion projects

      the effects that trends toward requiring recycling waste reduction at
       the source and prohibiting the disposal of certain types of wastes could
       have on volumes of waste going to landfills and wastetoenergy
       facilities

      the effect the weather has on our quarter to quarter results as well as
       the effect of extremely harsh weather on our operations

      the effect of price fluctuations of recyclable materials processed by the
       company

      the effect competition in our industry could have on our ability to
       maintain margins including uncertainty relating to competition with
       governmental sources that enjoy competitive advantages from taxexempt
       financing and tax revenue subsidies

                                        16
page   19

      possible defaults under our credit agreements if cash flows are less than
       we expect or capital expenditures are more than we expect and the
       possibility that we can not obtain additional capital on acceptable terms
       if needed

      possible diversions of managements attention and increases in operating
       expenses due to efforts by labor unions to organize our employees

      possible increases in operating expenses due to fuel price increases or
       fuel supply shortages

      the effects of general economic conditions and

      our ability to successfully deploy our new enterprisewide software
       systems

  strategic plan

     in 1999 the company announced a strategic plan focused on emphasizing
internal growth and focusing on our core business  north american solid waste
management services as part of the plan beginning in 1999 and throughout 2000
we sold the majority of our international operations and certain of our non
integrated north american solid waste operations we also have sold or
announced agreements to sell almost all of our noncore operations including
our lowlevel and other radioactive waste operations organic residuals
operations industrial services hazardous waste treatment operations and
independent power plants the proceeds from the sales were used to repay a
portion of our debt

     also as part of the plan the company began other initiatives in 1999 that
continued through 2000 including

      linking our information technology initiatives to our business strategy
       and rolling out new software systems that give our employees better tools
       to do their jobs

      developing standard policies and procedures and increasing the flow of
       communication in an effort to streamline our business and bring more
       discipline and accountability but at the same time maintain
       decentralized operations so that authority is still close to the
       customer and

      restoring a capital expenditure policy that focuses on the internal
       growth rather than the external growth of the company

  1999 accounting charges and adjustments

     during 1999 the company initiated a comprehensive internal review of its
accounting records systems processes and controls at the direction of its
board of directors as discussed below and in note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements the company experienced significant difficulty in the
integration and conversion of information and accounting systems subsequent to
the company then known as usa waste services inc completing its merger with
wm holdings which was accounted for as a pooling of interests the wm holdings
merger as a result of these systems and process issues and other issues
raised during the 1999 accounting review certain charges and adjustments were
recorded as discussed below the review was completed in time such that the
company was able to record related adjustments in its financial statements for
the quarter ended september 30 1999 the amounts recorded by the company as a
result of the review had a material effect on its financial statements for the
year ended december 31 1999 the

     subsequent to the completion of the accounting review and in conjunction
with the process of preparing its monthly financial statements during the fourth
quarter of 1999 and its financial statements at december 31 1999 additional
adjustments attributable to the reconciliation of intercompany accounts cash
accounts receivable fixed assets accounts payable and certain other accounts
were recorded

     the company recorded significant adjustments in the third and fourth
quarters of 1999 certain of which affect periods prior to these quarters
accordingly the company after consultation with its independent public
accountants concluded that its internal controls for the preparation of interim
financial information did not provide an adequate basis for its independent
public accountants to complete reviews of the quarterly financial data for the
quarters during 1999 the company believes that certain charges that were
recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 1999 may relate to individual prior
periods however the company does not have sufficient information to identify
all specific charges attributable to prior periods if identification of all
specific charges attributable to individual prior periods was possible the
company believes that the reported results of operations presented in note 21 to
the consolidated financial statements for the third and fourth quarters of 1999
would have been favorably impacted and the reported results of operations for
the first and second quarters of 1999 would have been adversely impacted the
company concluded based on its quantitative and qualitative analysis of
available information after consultation with its independent public
accountants that it did not have nor was it able to obtain sufficient
information to conclude what amount of the charges relate to any individual
prior year although qualitative analysis indicates that these charges are
principally related to 1999 accordingly the company has concluded that these
charges were appropriately reflected in the 1999 annual financial statements

     the company believes that the processes it used for the preparation of its
quarterly 2000 interim financial statements have improved in addition the
company has committed substantial resources to mitigate the previously
identified control weaknesses management believes these efforts have enabled
the company to produce timely and reliable interim financial statements during
2000

in 1999 and 126 billion in 1998 the higher revenues in 1999 reflect
acquisitions of solid waste businesses in north america the decrease in
revenues in 2000 is primarily due to the divestitures of wm international and

     nasw operating revenues increased in 2000 from 1999 primarily due to
internal growth of comparable operations of 14 or 150 million from pricing
increases and 25 or 267 million from volume increases during the first
half of 2000 the pricing in the recyclable materials markets favorably impacted

overall pricing increases however during the second half of 2000 the
recyclable materials market experienced a significant downturn that offset the
improvements experienced earlier in the year additionally the company
implemented a fuel surcharge in march 2000 to mitigate the significant increase
in the cost of fuel excluding the impact of price increases in the commodity
markets for recyclable materials and the fuel surcharge that was implemented
there was a price increase of 06 in 2000 compared to 1999 acquisitions of
nasw businesses during 2000 and the full year effect of acquisitions that were
completed in 1999 accounted for an increase in operating revenues of
approximately 286 million for 2000 as compared to 1999 the primary offset to
the increase in operating revenues was the divestiture of certain nonintegrated
nasw operations however the foreign currency fluctuations with the canadian
dollar also negatively impacted operating revenues during 2000

     nasw operating revenues in 1999 were lower than expected due to substantial
difficulties in the integration of operations after the mergers with wm holdings
on july 16 1998 and eastern environmental services on december 31 1998
including the information systems particularly the billing systems and related
work flow in 1999 the company experienced significant difficulty in the
conversion from the wm holdings information systems to the systems currently in
use resulting in delays and errors particularly with the billing systems
including delays in submitting bills to customers and errors in both computing
and delivering bills staffing levels were insufficient to address customer
complaints and disputes and did not support timely followup with customers
billing system issues initially became evident in the second quarter of 1999 as
receivable aging levels rose at that time management believed that the
increase in receivables was a shortterm issue receivables would return to
historical levels once the billing system conversions were complete and there
was not a significant collectability issue with its recorded receivables in
connection with the 1999 accounting review it was concluded that certain of
these accounts had deteriorated to the point that they may be uncollectable and
therefore a significant increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts was
recorded in the third quarter of 1999 these events also contributed a higher
than usual provision for uncollectable accounts in the fourth quarter of 1999
beginning in the third quarter of 1999 resources dedicated to receivable
collection efforts were increased on both a temporary and permanent basis and
the billing systems began to stabilize in 2000 the company was successful in
collecting certain accounts that were reserved for in 1999

     acquisitions of nasw business during 1999 and the full year effect of
acquisitions which were completed in 1998 accounted for an increase in operating
revenues of approximately 616 million for 1999 as compared to 1998 nasw
operating revenues also increased from internal growth of comparable operations
of 26 for 1999 as compared to 1998 the company believes that its internal
revenue growth in 1999 was detrimentally affected by certain inflexibilities in
its pricing strategy and the lack of responsiveness of that strategy to
localized competitive conditions resulting in lost customers and volumes
offsetting the increase in operating revenues were divestitures of nasw
businesses with revenues of approximately 290 million as well as other
business factors that comprised the remaining differences including the foreign
currency fluctuations with the canadian dollar

     the operating revenues from the wm international operations increased from
1998 to 1999 by approximately 76 this increase was primarily due to
acquisitions of businesses primarily in denmark and australia however in
2000 wm international operating revenue decreased as the company began selling
its wm international operations on a country by country basis as of december
31 2000 the company had certain operations in sweden and also operated
outside of north america in argentina and israel

     operating revenues for the nonsolid waste services decreased from 1998 to
2000 due to divestitures of several noncore businesses nonsolid waste
operating revenues are expected to decrease in 2001 because the company is
actively marketing for sale the remaining nonsolid waste operations

  operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown
  below

     operating costs and expenses decreased 731 million or 88 for 2000 as
compared to 1999 and increased 986 million or 135 for 1999 as compared to
1998 as a percentage of operating revenues operating costs and expenses
increased from 577 in 1998 to 630 in 1999 and were 604 in 2000

                                        23
page   26

     from 1998 to 2000 operating costs and expenses as a percentage of
operating revenues fluctuated from period to period primarily due to the
effects of the companys integration plan adopted in connection with the wm
holdings merger in july 1998 see operating revenues above

     in 1998 soon after the merger with wm holdings the company experienced
reductions both in amount and as a percentage of operating revenues in its
operating costs and expenses as a result of the reductions in employee headcount
and the elimination of excess operating assets that were either sold or
abandoned pursuant to the merger integration plan the company believes that the
reductions in employee headcount and the disposition of excess operating assets
resulted in shortterm cost efficiencies in 1998

     in 1999 the company continued the implementation of its merger integration
plan however due to the breadth and comprehensive nature of the changes the
company attempted to implement in the first half of 1999 the company was unable
to sustain the effectiveness of the plan operating costs and expenses increased
significantly as a percentage of revenues in second half of 1999 and throughout
2000 because the shortterm cost reductions experienced in 1998 could not be
sustained in 1999 due to the operational difficulties encountered by the
company however in the second half of 2000 the company started reviewing its
procurement practices and started developing more standardized operating
procedures and expects operating costs and expenses as a percentage of operating
revenues to decrease in 2001

     as part of its ongoing operations the company reviews its liability
requirements for remediation and other environmental matters based on an
analysis of among other things the regulatory context surrounding landfills
sitespecific environmental issues and remaining airspace capacity in light of
changes to operational efficiencies accordingly revisions to remediation
liability requirements may result in upward or downward adjustments to income
from operations in any given period adjustments for final closure and
postclosure estimates are accounted for prospectively over the remaining
capacity of the operating landfill the impact of revisions to remedial
environmental and other similar liabilities resulted in reductions of operating
costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues in the amount of 05 and 09 in
1999 and 1998 respectively

  general and administrative expenses

     general and administrative expenses decreased 182 million or 95 from
1999 to 2000 and increased 587 million or 440 from 1998 to 1999 as a
percentage of operating revenues the companys general and administrative
expense was 139 for 2000 146 for 1999 and 106 for 1998

     as discussed above the company believes it experienced shortterm cost
reductions related to the elimination of duplicate corporate administrative
functions from the merger with wm holdings in 1998 and the first half of 1999
however in the second half of 1999 and into early 2000 those cost reductions
were substantially offset by the effect of difficulties encountered by the
company in integrating the operations of wm holdings a major component of the
increased costs was increased administrative costs in field operations to
perform billing collection and other administrative functions

     in 2000 particularly the first half the company incurred significant
costs in professional accounting and process improvement consulting services
related to process improvement initiatives and accounting assistance that began
as part of the 1999 accounting review by the second half of 2000 the company
had stabilized its accounting systems and completed its process improvement
initiatives significantly reducing the ongoing need for these consulting
services additionally the company incurred significant consulting costs in
2000 related to the future implementation of new enterprise information systems
the need for which was identified as part of the companys 1999 strategic plan
discussed above in 2000 the company incurred approximately 196 million
related to professional accounting and process improvement consulting services
and consulting services related to the future implementation of new enterprise
information systems in 2000 the company also incurred approximately 51
million related to its efforts to divest operations to improve its billing
systems and verify its customer base and for legal fees related to certain
shareholder litigation and other sec matters as discussed in operating
revenues above the company was successful in collecting certain accounts that
were reserved for in 1999 collection of those accounts favorably impacted the
companys provision for bad debt in 2000 the company recorded provisions for
bad debts of 14 million and 268 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively the
company also experienced permanent staffing increases at the corporate office in
2000
                                        24
page   27

particularly in the area of information systems and corporate accounting and
finance the company expects that advances in its information systems and
business processes will result in better information for making operational and
strategic decisions as well as permanent reductions in field administrative
costs in future periods

     general and administrative expenses for 1999 included 403 million in
adjustments resulting from the 1999 accounting review some of which are
recurring in nature and should be expected in future periods these significant
adjustments include an increase of 168 million relative to the allowance for
doubtful accounts and include 63 million in costs for insurance adjustments
accounting legal and other professional services these costs are primarily
related to litigation and investigations conducted by the company in 1999 see
discussion in operating revenues and operating costs and expenses above of
the companys substantial difficulties in integrating the operations of wm
holdings subsequent to the wm holdings merger

  depreciation and amortization

     depreciation and amortization expense decreased 185 million or 115 in
2000 and increased 115 million or 77 in 1999 as compared to 1998 as a
percentage of operating revenues depreciation and amortization expense was
114 in 2000 123 in 1999 and 119 in 1998

     the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of
operating revenues in 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily due to the suspension
of depreciation in 2000 on fixed assets related to certain operations which were
heldforsale and the depreciation and amortization expense that was recorded in
1999 related to operations classified as heldforsale in the fourth quarter of
1999 and divested in 2000 the depreciation suspension for 2000 for these
heldforsale operations prior to those operations being sold was 99 million
or 08 of operating revenues the depreciation suspended in 1999 for operations
heldforsale which all occurred in the fourth quarter of 1999 was 46
million or 03 of operating revenues however these decreases in depreciation
and amortization expense were partially offset by increased landfill airspace
amortization in 2000 due to an increase in disposal volumes at the companys
landfills additionally for 2000 the company experienced higher airspace
amortization expense as compared to the prior years due to higher airspace
amortization rates as a result of its more stringent set of criteria for
evaluating the probability of obtaining airspace expansions which was effective
as of the third quarter of 1999 the increase in depreciation and amortization
expense in 1999 as compared to 1998 after considering the suspension of
depreciation for heldforsale operations in 1999 is primarily a result of the
companys acquisition activity in 1999 and the full year impact of acquisitions
in 1998

  merger and acquisition related costs asset impairments and unusual items

     in 2000 1999 and 1998 the company had significant charges related to
merger and acquisition related costs and asset impairments and unusual items in
1998 these charges primarily related to the companys merger integration plans
and related business reviews associated with the mergers with wm holdings and
eastern environmental services the merger integration plans included
significant employee severance costs restructuring costs transaction costs and
changes in certain employee benefit programs as well as charges for businesses
to be sold and assets to be abandoned the 1998 business review included charges
for losses on contractual commitments and changes in estimates on the ultimate
losses for certain legal and environmental issues and related costs in 1999
these charges were primarily identified in the 1999 accounting review or
resulted from the companys strategic plan discussed above in 2000 these costs
were primarily due to the sale of most of the companys wm international
operations as part of the companys strategic plan and the termination of the wm
holdings defined benefit pension plan see notes 4 13 and 16 to the
consolidated financial statements

  interest expense

     the decrease in interest expense in 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily
due to the net debt reduction in 2000 from proceeds related to the companys
divestiture program and cash flows from operations the increase in interest
expense in 1999 as compared to 1998 is due to higher average levels of
outstanding

                                        25
page   28

indebtedness during the respective years and also a decline in the companys
public credit rating which began in the last six months of 1999 and caused the
company to increase its use of more costly bank credit facilities instead of the
previously used commercial paper also contributing to period to period changes
in interest expense is the offsetting decrease in the amount of interest that
the company has capitalized during these years the company capitalized interest
of 22 million 34 million and 42 million for 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively

  provision for income taxes

     the company recorded a provision for income taxes of 418 million 232
million and 67 million for 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively resulting in an
effective income tax rate of 1302 1423 and 96 for each of the three
years respectively the difference in federal income taxes computed at the
federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for these years is primarily
due to state and local income taxes nondeductible costs related to acquired
intangibles nondeductible costs associated with the impairment and divestiture
of certain businesses and other 1999 charges and adjustments as discussed in
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and the cost associated with
remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries which are no longer
permanently reinvested excluding nondeductible heldforsale impairment
charges associated with certain businesses nondeductible losses on the
divestiture of assets that closed during the period and other unusual items the
companys tax provision would have been 409 of pretax income for 2000

liquidity and capital resources

     the company operates in an industry that requires a high level of capital
investment the companys capital requirements primarily stem from i its
working capital needs for its ongoing operations ii capital expenditures for
construction and expansion of its landfill sites as well as new trucks and
equipment for its collection operations iii refurbishments and improvements
at its wastetoenergy facilities and iv business acquisitions the companys
strategy is to meet these capital needs first from internally generated funds
historically the company has also obtained financing from various financing
sources available to the company at the time including the incurrence of debt
and the issuance of its common stock in august 1999 the company announced a
strategic plan that included the sale of its wm international operations its
noncore operations and selected nasw operations the proceeds from these
dispositions which were primarily realized in 2000 were used for debt
repayment at both december 31 2000 and march 8 2001 the company has unused
and available credit capacity under its bank credit facilities of 13 billion
the company believes that these levels of credit capacity are sufficient to meet
its ongoing operating requirements

     the following is a summary of the companys cash flows statements for the
years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 in millions



                                                           2000      1999      1998

investing activities    1072    2017   4555
financing activities   3279      426     2956


     in 1999 and 1998 cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by
the implementation of companys merger integration plans for the mergers with wm
holdings and eastern environmental services and the subsequent operational and
administrative difficulties discussed above in 1998 the company spent
approximately 36 billion on the acquisition of businesses and outstanding
minority interest positions as well as approximately 17 billion on capital
expenditures these investing activities in 1998 were primarily funded by cash
flows from operations net debt borrowings of approximately 20 billion
proceeds from sales of assets of approximately 545 million and proceeds from
the sale of common and treasury stock of approximately 945 million in 1999
the company spent approximately 13 billion on acquisitions of businesses and
approximately 13 billion on capital expenditures these investing activities
were funded by cash flows from operations net debt borrowings of approximately
259 million and proceeds from the sale of assets of approximately 651 million

     in 2000 cash flows from operations were impacted by several factors that
the company considers to be unusual including costs for professional accounting
fees and consulting activities associated with stabilizing and improving the
accounting systems and developing new enterprise information systems discussed
above the following summary of free cash flows has been prepared to highlight
and facilitate understanding of the primary cash flow elements it is not
intended to replace the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2000 which was
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles adjusted
free cash flow in the table below which is not a measure of financial
performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is

a  ebitda is defined as income from operations excluding depreciation and
     amortization merger and acquisition related costs and asset impairments
     and unusual items ebitda which is not a measure of financial performance
     under generally accepted accounting principles is provided because the
     company understands that such information is used by certain investors when
     analyzing the financial position and performance of the company

     consistent with the strategic initiative discussed above in 2000 the
company had a net debt reduction of approximately 33 billion funded through
its divestiture program and cash flows from operations

     under the terms of the companys 15 billion syndicated loan facility the
syndicated facility and its 14 billion senior revolving credit facility
the credit facility the company is obligated to repay the borrowings under
the facilities with the cash proceeds received from the strategic plan
divestitures the company was required to use all of the first 15 billion of
net proceeds from the divestitures to repay indebtedness which it has done
additionally the company is required to use 50 of the additional cash proceeds
greater than 15 billion and up to 25 billion from divestitures to repay the
indebtedness under the syndicated and credit facilities as of december 31
2000 the company had received cash proceeds of approximately 25 billion from
its divestitures approximately 175 million of which was used to repay the
companys eurocurrency facilities in the second quarter of 2000 approximately
100 million was used for repayment of divestiture subsidiary debts and the
remainder of which has been used to repay indebtedness under the bank credit
facilities

     on july 17 1998 the company issued 600 million of 6 18 mandatorily
tendered senior notes due july 15 2011 this debt instrument is subject to
certain mandatory tender features as described in the indenture which may
require the purchase by the company of a portion of or all of the outstanding
notes on july 15 2001 the company intends to either refinance these notes or
use borrowings available under the syndicated facility andor the credit
facility in the event it must purchase the notes on july 15 2001 accordingly
these borrowings have been classified as longterm at december 31 2000

     in february of 2001 the company issued 600 million of 7 38 senior
unsecured notes due august 1 2010 interest is payable semiannually on
february 1 and august 1 the net proceeds from the sale of the notes are
approximately 593 million after deducting discounts to the underwriters and
estimated expenses of the offering the company intends to use the net proceeds
together with cash on hand to repay in full the 200 million principal amount
outstanding under the 6 senior notes due may 15 2001 the 200 million
principal amount outstanding under the 670 senior notes due may 1 2001 and
the 200 million principal amount outstanding under the 7 18 senior notes due

will be invested temporarily in shortterm investments or be used to reduce
shortterm borrowings

recent developments

     the company has proposed a settlement to resolve a consolidated derivative
action pending in the chancery court of the state of delaware the derivative
action was brought against several former officers and directors of waste
management holdings and seeks among other things reimbursement of those monies
expended by waste management holdings and the company in resolving all claims
brought against wm holdings arising out of its february 1998 restatement of
earnings the terms of the settlement include a payment to the company of 15
million by certain of wm holdings insurance carriers and the complete
resolution of all pending claims for retirement benefits between certain former
officers of wm holdings and the company the resolution of the actions for
retirement benefits involves the release by the former executives who brought
claims against the company for certain amounts otherwise owing under the
retirement plans the total benefits to the company from the settlement of the
derivative case is approximately 23 million

environmental matters

     the company has material financial commitments for the costs associated
with its future obligations for final closure which is the closure of the
landfills and the capping of the final uncapped areas of the landfills and for
postclosure of the landfills it operates or for which it is otherwise
responsible the final closure and postclosure liabilities are charged to
expense as airspace is consumed such that the present value of total estimated
final closure and postclosure cost will be accrued for each landfill at the
time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed the company has also
established procedures to evaluate its potential remedial liabilities at closed
sites which it owns or operated or to which it transported waste including 79
sites listed on the epas national priority list npl the majority of
situations involving npl sites relate to allegations that subsidiaries of the
company or their predecessors transported waste to the facilities in question
often prior to the acquisition of such subsidiaries by the company in instances
in which the company has concluded that it is probable that a liability has been
incurred an accrual has been recorded in the financial statements

     estimates of the extent of the companys degree of responsibility for
remediation of a particular site and the method and ultimate cost of remediation
require a number of assumptions and are inherently difficult and the ultimate
outcome may differ from current estimates however the company believes that
its extensive experience in the environmental services business as well as its
involvement with a large number of sites provides a reasonable basis for
estimating its aggregate liability as additional information becomes available
estimates are adjusted as necessary while the company does not anticipate that
any such adjustment would be material to its financial statements it is
reasonably possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments
the results of environmental studies the nonexistence or inability of other
potentially responsible third parties to contribute to the settlements of such
liabilities or other factors could necessitate the recording of additional
liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on the companys
financial statements

     while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with
certainty the company has estimated that the aggregate cost of environmental
liabilities as of december 31 2000 is approximately 28 billion as of
december 31 2000 and 1999 the company had recorded liabilities of 613 million
and 600 million respectively for the present value of final closure and
postclosure costs of disposal facilities the
                                        28
page   31

difference between the final closure and postclosure costs accrued at december
31 2000 and the total present value of estimated costs represents final
closure and postclosure costs that will be accrued and charged to expense as
airspace is consumed such that the total present value of estimated final
closure and postclosure costs to be incurred will be fully accrued for each
landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed the
average landfill final closure and postclosure expense on a per ton basis for
the 305 landfills operating at december 31 2000 was 030 per ton as of
december 31 2000 and 1999 the company had recorded liabilities of 349 million
and 377 million respectively for the present value of remediation costs of
disposal facilities for fiscal 2001 we expect to spend approximately 153
million for our final closure postclosure and remediation expenditures

     as of december 31 2000 the company also expects to incur approximately
69 billion related to future construction activities during the remaining
operating lives of the disposal sites which are capitalized as incurred and
expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed
the average landfill airspace amortization cost per ton for the 305 landfills
operating at december 31 2000 was 384 per ton

seasonality and inflation

     the companys operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter
months which corresponds with the companys first and fourth quarters this is
primarily attributable to the facts that i the volume of waste relating to
construction and demolition activities tends to increase in the spring and
summer months and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain
regions where the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months

     the company believes that inflation has not had and is not expected to
have any material adverse effect on the results of operations in the near
future

no 133 as amended establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring
that all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts be recorded as either assets or liabilities
measured at fair value sfas 133 as amended requires that changes in the
derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met the accounting for changes in the fair value
of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation the company adopted sfas 133 on january 1 2001 as of january 1
2001 the cumulative effect of such change in accounting for derivative
instruments to fair value is expected to result in a gain net of taxes of
approximately 2 million in the first quarter of 2001

     in december 1999 the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 101
revenue recognition sab no 101 sab no 101 provides registrants guidance
on the recognition presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements and was required to be adopted by the company in the fourth quarter
of 2000 since our policies were already compliant with sab no 101 no material
changes to revenue recognition occurred



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

     in the normal course of business the company is exposed to market risk
including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates certain commodity
prices and certain equity prices from time to time the company and certain of
its subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks the
derivatives used are simple agreements that provide for payments based on the
notional amount with no multipliers or leverage all derivatives are related to
actual or anticipated exposures of transactions of the company while
                                        29
page   32

the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to derivatives in all cases such counterparties are highly rated
financial institutions and the company does not anticipate nonperformance the
company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes the company monitors its derivative positions by regularly evaluating
the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses

     the company has performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate
changes will affect the fair value of the companys market risk sensitive
derivatives and related positions such an analysis is inherently limited in
that it represents a singular hypothetical set of assumptions actual market
movements may vary significantly from the companys assumptions the effects of
such market movements may also directly or indirectly affect the companys
assumptions and its rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow
or earnings effect on the company from the assumed market rate movements

     interest rate exposure  the companys exposure to market risk for changes
in interest rates relates primarily to the companys debt obligations which are
mainly denominated in us dollars in addition interest rate swaps are
generally used to either lockin or limit the variability in the interest
expense of certain floating rate debt obligations or to manage the mix of fixed
and floating rate debt obligations an instantaneous one percentage point
increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves
would increase the fair value of the companys combined debt and interest rate
swap positions at december 31 2000 and 1999 by approximately 403 million and
443 million respectively this analysis does not reflect the effect that
declining interest rates would have on other items such as pension liabilities
nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments
for interest since a significant portion of the companys debt is at fixed
rates changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating
results until and unless such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity

     currency rate exposure  the company incurred exchange rate risk from
borrowings denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 1999 an
instantaneous ten percent increase in foreign exchange rates would have
decreased the fair value of the companys foreign currency borrowings by
approximately 43 million the company had no foreign currency borrowings at
december 31 2000

     commodities price exposure  the company markets recycled paper products
such as old newspaper onp and old corrugated containers occ the company
started entering into financial swaps in 1999 in an effort to mitigate the risk
of recyclable paper price fluctuations under its financial swap agreements the
company transfers a floating market price for a fixed price for a fixed period
of time the two parties agree to use a market index as an indicator of the
market price during the term of the swap an instantaneous ten percent increase
in this commodity at december 31 2000 and 1999 creates an exposure risk of
approximately 7 million and 50000 respectively the increase in exposure
risk from 1999 to 2000 is attributable to the greater number of financial swap
agreements that were outstanding at the end of the respective periods all of
the companys waste paper hedges are cash settled on a monthly basis with the
counterparty

     equity price exposure  the company is also subject to equity price
exposure from company debt issues that are convertible into the companys common
stock these debt issues had an aggregate carrying value of 566 million and
962 million as of december 2000 and 1999 respectively an instantaneous ten
percent decrease in the companys stock price on december 31 2000 and 1999
would increase the fair value of the companys convertible debt by approximately
11 million and 12 million respectively

our report thereon dated march 7 2001 in which we expressed an unqualified
opinion based upon our audits our report contained an explanatory paragraph
indicating that we attempted but were unable to review the quarterly financial
data for the interim periods within 1999 included in note 21 to the companys
consolidated financial statements our audits were made for the purpose of
forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole schedule
ii is the responsibility of the companys management and is presented for
purposes of complying with the securities and exchange commissions rules and is
not part of the basic financial statements schedule ii has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
