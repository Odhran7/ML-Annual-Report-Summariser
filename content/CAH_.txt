risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks we do not currently consider material to our operations or of which we are not presently aware 

legal regulatory  compliance risks 

the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business  

our pharmaceutical segment distributes prescription opioid pain medications the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication has become a public health crisis 

a significant number of states counties municipalities and other public plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmaceutical wholesale distributors including us retail chains and others relating to the manufacturing marketing or distribution of prescription opioid pain medications 

in april 2022 an agreement settling the vast majority of opioidrelated lawsuits filed against us by state and local governmental entities the settlement agreement became effective the settlement agreement includes a cash component pursuant to which we will pay up to approximately 60 billion the majority of which we expect to be paid over 18 years the settlement agreement also includes injunctive relief terms relating to distributors controlled substance antidiversion programs including with respect to 1 governance 2 independence and training of the personnel operating controlled substances monitoring programs 3 due diligence for new and existing customers 4 ordering limits for certain products and 5 suspicious order monitoring a monitor will oversee compliance with these provisions for a period of five years in addition the distributors will engage a thirdparty vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting which the distributors will fund for ten years it is possible that the implementation and maintenance of the required changes to distributors controlled substance antidiversion programs may result in unforeseen costs or operational challenges which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or performance 

in addition to the claims brought by states and other local governmental entities we are also being sued by private plaintiffs such as unions other health and welfare funds hospital systems third party payors other healthcare providers and individuals alleging personal injury for the same activities and could be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits 

we have received federal grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with investigations being conducted by the us attorneys office for the eastern district of new york and the fraud section of the us department of justice doj we have also received civil requests for information from other doj offices 

we believe that these investigations concern operation of our antidiversion program our antidiversion policies and procedures and distribution of certain controlled substances 

we are involved in legal proceedings with insurers related to the availability of insurance coverage for some matters described above but the defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits and investigations are subject to uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity or our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares beyond the amounts accrued and beyond what we may be able to recover from our insurers in addition they could have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business 

other legislative regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and the distribution of these medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example several states have adopted or proposed taxes or other fees on the sale of opioids these laws and proposals vary in the tax amounts imposed and the means of calculation liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted 

ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits investigations regulations and legislative actions and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations 

our business is subject to other rigorous quality regulatory and licensing requirements 

as described in greater detail in the business section products that we manufacture source distribute or market must comply with quality and regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance including noncompliance by thirdparty contract manufacturers may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import manufacture or source products as well as product bans recalls safety alerts or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions which in turn could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device or other product and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

also as described in greater detail in the business section our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 





to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits product registrations licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies for example as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances we must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa failure to maintain or renew necessary permits product registrations licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information regulations currently in place continue to evolve and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect handle and maintain personal or patient information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations violations of federal state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties breach of contract claims costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations from time to time regulatory authorities investigate our policies or practices and may challenge them we are periodically subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs or other remedial measures 

for example the united states attorney’s office for the district of massachusetts and the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services conducted an investigation related to discounts and rebates offered or provided to certain specialty solutions customers as a result of qui tam actions for more information on this investigation see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in connection with this investigation in january 2022 our specialty pharmaceutical distribution business in the specialty solutions division entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services it is possible that as a result of the corporate integrity agreement we could incur greater costs or operational impacts than anticipated that may adversely impact our business 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs such as state medicaid programs and the federal 340b drug pricing program in addition some businesses manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are 

otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

private challenges to government healthcare policy may also have a significant impact on our business for example the federal 340b drug pricing program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer discounts on certain drugs purchased by covered entities and some of our pharmaceutical segment customers are covered entities or contract pharmacies for covered entities over a dozen pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally restricted sales under the 340b drug pricing program to contract pharmacies these practices are the subject of ongoing litigation however if manufacturers continue this practice and if courts uphold this practice our customers may be adversely impacted which could adversely impact our business 

industry participants including us rely on ethylene oxide “eto” to sterilize certain medical products that we manufacture or distribute regulatory actions have been taken by certain environmental regulatory authorities to reduce eto emissions during the sterilization and distribution process if such measures become more widespread we could experience increased costs to comply with reduced emissions standards and it is possible that we and other industry participants may be unable to effectively sterilize medical products possibly resulting in industrywide supply shortages or a reduction in surgical or medical procedures such increased costs or industrywide reductions in surgical and medical procedures would have a negative impact on our medical segment profit additionally we have been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of eto emissions as a result of a notice of violation we received from an environmental regulator in georgia we are making specified changes to a replenishment center in that state it is possible that these or future regulatory actions or lawsuits could adversely impact our ability to procure products to distribute resulting in increased costs or industry supply disruptions 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

our global operations including transition services in connection with divestitures are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply or are alleged to fail to comply with any of these laws we could be subject to investigations or suffer civil or criminal sanctions 

we are also subject to government import and export controls and regulations including the requirement that we make a determination based on the best information that we have available at the time as to the country of origin of products that we 





source or manufacture outside the united states us customs and border protection may challenge our determinations which could result in products being detained or the imposition of fines and penalties and may result in supply disruptions 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or 

challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 

from time to time proposals are made in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate or tax payments specific initiatives that may impact us include possible increases in us or foreign corporate income tax rates or other changes in tax law to raise revenue the repeal of the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes the establishment or increase in taxation at the us state level on the basis of gross revenues recommendations of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission’s investigation into illegal state aid 

additionally in connection with the accruals taken in connection with opioidrelated lawsuits in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we recorded net tax benefits of 228 million and 488 million respectively reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the tax act however these estimates require significant judgment and it is possible that they could be subject to challenges by the irs 

the us tax law governing deductibility was changed by the tax act and the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits or tax law could change again the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these matters 

in fiscal year 2021 our provision for income taxes reflects a 424 million benefit from the tax benefits of a net operating loss carryback under the cares act also as a result of this net operating loss carryback we received a us federal income tax refund of 966 million in connection with this net operating loss carryback certain industry participants including us received a letter from the us house of representatives’ committee on oversight and reform questioning among other things our plans to take tax deductions for opioidrelated losses including our use of the net operating loss carryback provisions under the cares act and deductibility under the tax act we responded to the letter it is possible that the irs could challenge our tax position with respect to this selfinsurance loss if these initiatives are successful our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions tax laws 

are complex and subject to varying interpretations with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year proposed adjustments in ongoing audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

changes to the us healthcare environment may not be favorable to us 

over a number of years the us healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and patient outcomes contain costs and increase efficiencies these changes include a general decline in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers the basis for payments beginning to transition from a feeforservice model to valuebased payments and risksharing models and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics physician offices and patients’ homes 

we expect the us healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future possible changes include further reduction of or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits these possible changes and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes may adversely affect us 

legal proceedings could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our business which includes the distribution of controlled substances and other pharmaceutical products and the sourcing marketing and manufacturing of medical products we regularly become involved in disputes litigation and regulatory matters litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

for example we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described above in the risk factor titled the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business and in note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims for example we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease ivc filter products and in lawsuits alleging impurities in the active pharmaceutical ingredients in certain pharmaceutical products in addition product liability insurance for these types of claims is becoming more limited and may not be available to us at 





amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain it is possible that a settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim may not be covered by insurance or exceed available insurance recoveries if this happens and if any such settlement or judgment is in excess of any prior accruals our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

in connection with legal proceedings we occasionally enter into settlement agreements or become subject to consent decrees containing ongoing financial or operational obligations including the injunctive relief provisions of the national settlement agreement and the corporate integrity agreement mentioned above failure to comply with obligations under these agreements or decrees could lead to monetary or other penalties 

business  operational risks 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems business processes critical facilities and distribution networks 

we rely on our and thirdparty service providers information systems for a wide variety of critical operations including to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

• facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 

• receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

• manage accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers 

• process payments to suppliers 

• facilitate manufacturing and assembly of medical products and 

• generate financial information 

our business also depends on the proper functioning of our and our suppliers business processes critical facilities including our national logistics center and our distribution networks our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service providers business processes information systems critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted including disruption of access are damaged or fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic as they have been by the covid19 pandemic or power outage or due to cybersecurity incidents ransomware or other actions of third parties including labor strikes or shortages political unrest and terrorist attacks manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action production quality deviations safety issues or raw material shortages or defects or because a key product or component is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities 

from time to time our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service 

providers for key systems and processes such as receiving and processing customer orders customer service and accounts payable for example during fiscal 2022 our pharmaceutical segment implemented a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems and we have also transitioned certain finance processes to a thirdparty service provider if any of these initiatives or similar initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting 

our ability to compete effectively is increasingly dependent on access to and interpretation of data data quality impacts customer ordering order fulfillment and higher order processing if we fail to effectively implement and maintain data governance structures across our businesses or to effectively interpret and utilize such data our operations could be impacted and we may be at a competitive disadvantage 

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a material cyberattack or other systems breach 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive protected information relating to our customers company workforce and individuals with whom we and our customers conduct business we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to information security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition hardware software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security 

unauthorized parties have gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to our or a service providers systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deception we have been the target of cyber attacks including in prior fiscal years incidents where certain customer account information was accessed although we do not believe these incidents had a material impact on us similar incidents or events in the future may negatively impact our business reputation or financial results 

any compromise of our or a service providers information systems including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements including the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and those related to patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information as further described in the risk factor titled “our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements” above 

in addition insurance for losses arising from cyberattacks or other breaches is becoming more costly and limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain it is possible that we could incur 





losses that may not be covered by insurance or that would exceed available insurance recoveries if this happens our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our goodwill may become further impaired which could require us to record additional significant charges to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us gaap requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist as a result of adverse financial results in our medical unit resulting from inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints we performed interim goodwill impairment testing for the medical unit for the periods ended december 31 2021 and march 31 2022 as a result of both of these interim tests and the annual test conducted for the period ended june 30 2022 we recorded an aggregate 21 billion impairment to goodwill related to our medical unit in fiscal year 2022 

this testing involves estimates and significant judgments by management we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate however additional adverse changes in key assumptions including a failure to meet expected earnings or other financial plans unanticipated events and circumstances such as changes in assumptions about the duration and magnitude of increased supply chain and commodities costs and our planned efforts to mitigate such impacts further disruptions in the supply chain the impact of the cordis divestiture estimated demand and selling prices for ppe a further increase in the discount rate a decrease in the terminal growth rate increases in tax rates including potential tax reform or a significant change in industry or economic trends could affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and may result in an additional goodwill impairment in our medical unit it is also possible that we may record significant charges related to other reporting units any charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates in mda above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing 

our sales and credit concentration is significant 

cvs health and optumrx are large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue cvs health accounted for 25 percent of our fiscal 2022 revenue and 24 percent of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2022 and optumrx accounted for 16 percent of our fiscal 2022 revenue if either of these customers terminates their agreements due to an alleged default by us defaults in payment or significantly reduces their purchases from us our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for that business for example we completed the divestiture of the cordis business in fiscal 2022 and in the past few years we have also divested our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution 

business in china and our ownership interest in navihealth inc when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we could also incur higher costs or charges than planned or incur unexpected charges and could experience greater dissynergies than expected which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our ability to manage and complete acquisitions could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition 

from time to time we look to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses completion of acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses involve a number of risks including the following we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management’s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties or delays establishing integrating or combining operations and systems including manufacturing facilities we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

industry  economic risks 

we could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic in addition competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical segments may be increased by new business models new entrants new regulations changes in consumer demand or general competitive dynamics our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors which adversely affects our margins if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s profit margin could be adversely affected by changes in industry or market dynamics that we are not able to accurately predict 

as has been the case for several years the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer purchase volumes pricing changes customer contract renewals generic pharmaceutical launches and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain as does their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings these factors have contributed to declines in some prior years and have more than offset the benefits from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs health if performance of our generic pharmaceutical program declines in future fiscal years and we are 





unable to offset the decline our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will be adversely affected 

with respect to branded pharmaceutical products compensation under our contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost 

also almost all of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them however under certain agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as a part of our compensation in recent years manufacturers have increased prices less than in prior years if manufacturers in the aggregate change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost decide to reduce prices not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our margins could be adversely affected 

we depend on direct and indirect suppliers to make their 

products and raw materials available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs availability and regulatory risk associated with these products and raw materials 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins pulp cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 we have experienced higher supply chain costs which had a negative impact on medical segment profit in fiscal 2021 and 2022 supply chain constraints have also had a negative impact on sales within our medical segment we expect these cost increases and supply chain constraints to continue to have a negative impact on segment profit primarily in the medical segment in fiscal 2023 

w e do not expect to offset the full impact of these cost increases in fiscal year 2023 we intend to offset some cost increases through cost reductions and through price increases or surcharges however due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations passing along cost increases is challenging if we are not able to increase prices as planned medical segment profit could be negatively impacted to a greater extent than we currently anticipate 

we depend on others to manufacture some products that we market and distribute our operations are also dependent on various components compounds raw materials and energy supplied by others we purchase many of these components raw materials and energy and source certain products from numerous suppliers in various countries in some instances for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure 

certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier our supplier relationships could be interrupted become less favorable to us or be terminated and the supply of these components compounds raw materials or products could be interrupted or become insufficient 

these supply interruptions or other disruptions in manufacturing processes could be caused by events beyond our control including natural disasters supplier facility shutdowns defective raw materials the impact of epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and actions by us or international governments including import or export restrictions or tariffs for example the uyghur forced labor prevention act which went into effect in june 2022 prohibits the importation of any goods grown produced manufactured or mined in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china unless importers can provide clear and convincing evidence that goods were not made using forced labor if we determine that some of our imported source materials derive from this region we could experience additional supply constraints and our performance could be negatively impacted 

in addition due to the stringent regulatory requirements regarding the manufacture and sourcing of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components materials or products a sustained supply reduction or interruption and an inability to develop alternative and additional sources for such supply could result in lost sales increased cost damage to our reputation and may have an adverse effect on our business 

employee attrition may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or internal controls 

our ability to attract retain and develop qualified and experienced employees including key executives and other talent is critical for us to meet our business objectives we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees competition among potential employers has resulted in increases in salaries and wages benefits and other employeerelated costs it is possible that we could experience loss of key personnel for a variety of causes if we do not adequately plan for succession of key roles or if we are not successful in attracting or retaining new talent our performance or internal control over financial reporting could be adversely impacted 

consolidation in the us healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations 

in recent years us healthcare industry participants including distributors manufacturers suppliers healthcare providers insurers and pharmacy chains have consolidated or formed strategic alliances consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents if this consolidation trend continues it could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies and exposure to economic political and currency and other 





risks could disrupt our global operations or negatively impact our financial results 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including europe asia and latin america global developments can affect our business in many ways our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and competition additionally divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks related to trade protection laws tariffs excise or other border taxes on goods sourced from certain countries or on the importation or exportation of products or raw materials changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies or tariffs could impact our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers we may be required to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we need or to manufacture certain of our products this could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

in addition we conduct our business in us dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results which are reported in us dollars we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures 

geopolitical dynamics caused by political economic social or other conditions in foreign countries and regions may continue to impact our business and results of operations both of our segments have experienced increased costs including for fuel and it is possible that we could experience supply disruptions or shortages if tariffs or other protective measures are enacted 

covid19 risks 

we have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted our businesses in a variety of ways beginning in fiscal year 2020 including volume declines in our pharmaceutical segment and supply chain constraints and unusual ppe supply and demand dynamics in our medical segment while volumes within the pharmaceutical segment have largely rebounded our medical segment continues to experience the effects of inflation supply chain constraints and ppe dynamics which due to the passage of time intervening events and other market dynamics we now consider to be independent from covid19 for purposes of our assessment of our financial condition 

however the covid19 pandemic is ongoing and w e cannot estimate its continued length or severity or the related consequences on our business and operations including whether and when normal economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which further disruption may impact our business financial position results of operations or cash flow the covid19 pandemic has also heightened other risks including risks associated with competitive pressures supplier relationships

consolidated results 

fiscal 2022 overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2022 was 1814 billion a 12 percent increase from the prior year primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty pharmaceutical customers which largely consisted of branded pharmaceutical sales to existing and net new customers 

gaap and nongaap operating earningsloss 



the sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments 

we had a gaap operating loss of 596 million during fiscal 2022 due to 21 billion pretax noncash goodwill impairment charges related to the medical segment see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates section of this mda and note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail during fiscal 2021 we recognized pretax charges of 117 billion for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications see further description of opioid lawsuits in the significant developments in fiscal 2022 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

nongaap operating earnings during fiscal 2022 decreased 12 percent primarily due to the decrease in medical segment profit largely resulting from net inflationary impacts which primarily related to increased transportation and commodities costs partially offset by certain price increases and the adverse impact of global supply chain constraints

3 for fiscal 2022 gaap diluted loss per share attributable to cardinal health inc and the eps impact from the gaap to nongaap per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 279 million common shares which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effects resulting from our gaap net loss for the period fiscal 2022 nongaap diluted eps is calculated using a weighted average of 280 million common shares which includes potentially dilutive shares 

4 impairments and gainloss on disposals of assets net includes pretax goodwill impairment charges of 21 billion related to the medical segment recorded during fiscal 2022 the net tax benefit related to these charges was 150 million 





5 litigation recoveriescharges net includes a tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2021 related to a net operating loss carryback our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and adjusted our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act the total benefit from the net operating loss carryback was 424 million however for purposes of nongaap financial measures we allocated 389 million of the benefit to litigation recoveriescharges net which is excluded from nongaap measures based on the relative amount of the selfinsurance pretax loss related to opioid litigation claims versus separate tax adjustments the tax benefit allocated to the separate tax adjustments of 35 million is included in nongaap measures 

during fiscal 2022 gaap diluted eps was adversely impacted by the goodwill impairment charges related to the medical segment which had a 694 per share aftertax impact see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates section of this mda and note 4 and note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

during fiscal 2021 gaap diluted eps was positively impacted by 144 per share due to a tax benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily related to a selfinsurance pretax loss as further described in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the charges we recognized in fiscal 2021 for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications had a 321 per share aftertax impact on gaap diluted eps 

during fiscal 2022 nongaap diluted eps decreased 9 percent to 506 due to factors impacting nongaap operating earnings partially offset by a lower share count as a result of share repurchases 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 47 billion at june 30 2022 compared to 34 billion at june 30 2021 the increase in cash during fiscal 2022 was due to net cash provided by operating activities of 31 billion net cash provided by operating activities includes a refund of 966 million for the tax benefit from the net operating loss carryback related to a selfinsurance pretax loss and reflects the impact of 417 million of payments related to the settlement agreement the settlement agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities payments under the separate new york ohio and rhode island settlements as well as certain payments under the cherokee nation settlement fiscal 2022 operating cash flow was also impacted by favorable timing of net working capital 

we also received proceeds of 923 million net of cash transferred from the divestiture of the cordis business and we deployed 10 billion for share repurchases 885 million for debt repayments 559 million for dividends and 387 million for capital expenditures 





significant developments in fiscal 2022 and trends 

opioid lawsuits developments 



national settlement 

beginning in fiscal year 2017 state attorneys general counties and municipalities began filing lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications against pharmaceutical wholesalers including us and other participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain by fiscal year 2022 cardinal health was a defendant in approximately 2775 lawsuits brought by state attorneys general and counties municipalities and other political subdivisions in july 2021 we and two other national distributors collectively the “distributors” announced a proposed settlement with a group of state attorneys general intended to resolve the vast majority of these lawsuits the national settlement as well as a proposed settlement agreement the settlement agreement containing among other things a signon process to allow states and political subdivisions to participate in the national settlement 

in february 2022 the distributors announced that each company had determined that a sufficient number of states and political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the national settlement to proceed to effectiveness of that settlement the settlement agreement became effective on april 2 2022 

parties to the national settlement include 46 out of 49 eligible states as well as the district of columbia and all eligible territories as of august 9 2022 over 99 percent of eligible political subdivisions as calculated by population under the settlement agreement that had brought opioidrelated suits against the companies have joined the settlement or otherwise had their claims addressed by state legislation 

the settlement agreement includes a cash component pursuant to which we will pay up to approximately 60 billion the majority of which is expected to be paid over 18 years the exact payment amount will depend on several factors including the extent to which states take action to foreclose opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions eg by passing laws barring or limiting opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions and the extent to which additional political subdivisions in participating states file opioid lawsuits against us 

the settlement agreement also includes injunctive relief terms related to distributors’ controlled substance antidiversion programs including with respect to 1 governance 2 independence and training of the personnel operating controlled substances monitoring programs 3 due diligence for new and existing customers 4 ordering limits for certain products and 5 suspicious order monitoring a monitor will oversee compliance with these provisions for a period of five years in addition the distributors will engage a thirdparty vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting which the distributors will fund for ten years 

during fiscal 2022 we made our first annual payment under the settlement agreement prior to the effective date of the settlement agreement the distributors had entered into separate settlement agreements with each of the states of florida new york ohio and rhode island when the settlement agreement became effective each of these states and their participating subdivisions became a part of the national settlement however the new york ohio and rhode island agreements required us to make certain payments separately from those required by the settlement agreement accordingly during fiscal 2022 we made payments under the separate new york ohio and rhode island settlements as well as certain payments under the cherokee nation settlement in total we paid 417 million in connection with these matters during fiscal 2022 we have 636 billion accrued at june 30 2022 of which 532 million is included in other accrued liabilities and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets in july 2022 we made our second annual payment of 374 million under the settlement agreement 

other settlements 

west virginia subdivisions and native american tribes are not a part of the national settlement and we had separate negotiations with these groups a bench trial before a federal judge in west virginia in a case brought by cabell county and city of huntington against the distributors concluded in july 2021 in july 2022 a judgment in favor of the distributors was entered in july 2022 the distributors reached an agreement to settle the opioidrelated claims of the majority of the remaining west virginia subdivisions under this agreement cardinal health agreed to pay eligible west virginia subdivisions up to approximately 124 million over an elevenyear period this agreement is subject to certain contingencies related to subdivision participation in september 2021 we announced that the distributors had reached an agreement with the cherokee nation in connection with ongoing negotiations toward a broader agreement with native american tribes in january 2022 the distributors executed a term sheet with the native american tribes 

in may 2022 the distributors reached an agreement with the washington attorney general under which cardinal health will pay up to approximately 160 million to the state of washington and its participating political subdivisions to resolve opioidrelated claims this amount is consistent with the amount that would have been allocated to washington under the settlement agreement plus certain attorneys’ fees and costs the terms of this agreement are consistent with the settlement agreement this agreement is subject to certain contingencies including the rate of subdivision participation 

in june 2022 the distributors reached an agreement with the state of oklahoma to resolve the opioidrelated claims of the state and its political subdivisions under this agreement cardinal health agreed to pay up to approximately 95 million to the state and its participating 





subdivisions this amount is consistent with the amount that would have been allocated to oklahoma under the settlement agreement the terms of this agreement are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement this agreement is subject to certain contingencies including the rate of subdivision participation if this agreement and the washington agreement are finalized oklahoma and washington would be subject to the settlement agreement and 48 of 49 eligible states would then be subject to the settlement agreement 

in addition to the lawsuits and claims brought by states and governmental entities described above we are involved in other opioidrelated litigation and investigations which are described further in note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints 



medical segment profit was significantly negatively affected by inflationary impacts primarily related to transportation including ocean and domestic freight commodities labor and global supply chain constraints in fiscal 2022 

we expect these inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints to continue to adversely impact medical segment profit in fiscal 2023 and beyond in order to partially mitigate this impact we have implemented initial phases of price increases and we intend to implement additional price increases we are also evolving our commercial contracting processes to provide us with greater pricing flexibility and investing in additional supply chain capacity these increased costs and global supply chain constraints are difficult to predict and may be greater than we expect or continue longer than our current expectations in the event these costs decrease the benefit to medical segment profit will be delayed until the highercost inventory has moved through our supply chain our plans to increase prices and evolve our contracting strategies are subject to contingencies and uncertainties and it is possible that our results of operations will be adversely impacted to a greater extent than we currently anticipate 

to a lesser extent inflationary impacts primarily related to increased transportation and labor costs also adversely impacted pharmaceutical segment profit during fiscal 2022 we expect these inflationary costs to continue to adversely impact pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2023 

ppe demand and pricing 



personal protective equipment ppe refers to protective clothing medical and nonmedical grade gloves face shields face masks and other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness demand for ppe has fluctuated during fiscal 2022 and 2021 resulting in variability in sales volumes inventory levels and costs to manufacture and source these products 

ppe adversely impacted medical segment profit on a yearoveryear basis during fiscal 2022 primarily due to declines in volume and the prioryear positive impact of the timing of ppe cost mitigation efforts primarily pricing the demand and pricing for ppe is subject to risks and uncertainties which may impact medical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2023 

the yearoveryear comparison was also impacted by an inventory reserve of 197 million primarily related to certain categories of gloves which adversely impacted medical segment profit in fiscal 2021 see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates section of this mda for additional detail 

medical goodwill 

due to the adverse impact on our financial results from the risks and uncertainties related to inflationary impacts global supply chain constraints and ppe demand and pricing and increases in the riskfree interest rate we performed goodwill impairment testing for the medical reporting unit within the medical segment during fiscal 2022 this testing resulted in cumulative pretax charges of 21 billion which are included in impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earningsloss see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates section of this mda and note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

adverse changes in key assumptions or a significant change in industry or economic trends during fiscal 2023 could result in additional goodwill impairment 





pharmaceutical segment generics program 

the performance of our pharmaceutical segment generics program positively impacted the yearoveryear comparison of pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2022 which includes improvement in volumes compared to the prioryear period the pharmaceutical segment generics program includes among other things the impact of generic pharmaceutical product launches customer volumes pricing changes and the red oak sourcing llc venture red oak sourcing with cvs health corporation cvs health the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer volumes pricing changes customer contract renewals and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes all impact pharmaceutical segment profit and are subject to risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties may impact pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2023 

cordis divestiture 

in august 2021 we sold the cordis business to hellman  friedman for proceeds of 923 million net of cash transferred and we retained certain working capital accounts and certain liabilities cardinal health will retain product liability associated with lawsuits and claims related to inferior vena cava ivc filters in the us and canada as well as authority for these matters discussed in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in connection with the closing we entered into a transition services agreement tsa with the buyer to provide support functions for a period of up to twentyfour months following the sale see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as anticipated medical segment revenue and medical segment profit were adversely impacted by approximately 700 million and 70 million respectively in fiscal 2022 due to the divestiture of the cordis business the divestiture also resulted in a decrease in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets during fiscal 2022 the divestiture of the cordis business is subject to risks and uncertainties that may further adversely impact medical segment profit for example the tsa period may be extended beyond our current expectations or could have unintended consequences and the costs associated with the exit or disposal activities and stranded costs could be greater than anticipated 





results of operations 

revenue 





fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2022 pharmaceutical segment revenue grew by 196 billion primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty pharmaceutical customers which largely consisted of branded pharmaceutical sales to existing and net new customers 

medical segment 

fiscal 2022 medical segment revenue decreased by 800 million primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of the cordis business medical segment revenue was also adversely impacted by lower volumes within products and distribution which was partially offset by sales growth in athome solutions 

cost of products sold 



cost of products sold for fiscal 2022 increased 191 billion 12 percent due to the factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin 





gross margin 



  



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 



fiscal 2022 consolidated gross margin decreased primarily due to the divestiture of the cordis business and increased costs in the medical segment due to net inflationary impacts and the adverse impact of global supply chain constraints partially offset by the performance of our pharmaceutical segment generics program and an improvement in volumes primarily in generic and branded pharmaceuticals compared to the prioryear period the yearoveryear comparison was also favorably impacted by the prioryear inventory reserve recorded in the medical segment to reduce the carrying value of certain ppe primarily certain categories of gloves to net realizable value 

gross margin rate declined 56 basis points during fiscal 2022 mainly due to changes in overall product mix primarily driven by increased pharmaceutical distribution branded sales which have a dilutive impact on our overall gross margin rate the performance of medical segment products and distribution which reflects the divestiture of the cordis business and increased costs due to net inflationary impacts and the adverse impact of global supply chain constraints also had an adverse impact on gross margin rate the yearoveryear comparison was favorably impacted by the prioryear inventory reserve recorded in the medical segment to reduce the carrying value of certain ppe primarily certain categories of gloves to net realizable value 

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 



sga expenses increased slightly during fiscal 2022 largely due to inflationary impacts primarily related to increased transportation and labor costs increased costs related to investments in information technology infrastructure and higher costs to support sales growth primarily offset by the impact of the divestiture of the cordis business 

the yearoveryear comparison was also favorably impacted by the prioryear 41 million accrual for our estimated portion of the assessment on prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in new york state in calendar year 2017 and 2018 which was recognized during fiscal 2021 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new york opioid stewardship act 





segment profit 



we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit among other measures see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2022 pharmaceutical segment profit increased due to the performance of our generics program partially offset by increased costs related to investments in information technology infrastructure and inflationary impacts primarily related to increased transportation and labor costs pharmaceutical segment profit was also positively impacted by improvement in volumes primarily in generic and branded pharmaceuticals compared to the prioryear period 

pharmaceutical segment profit includes opioidrelated litigation defense and compliance costs but does not include a onetime contingent attorneys fee of 18 million recorded in fiscal 2022 which related to the finalization of the settlement agreement due to the unique nature and significance of the settlement agreement and the onetime contingent nature of the fee this fee was included in litigation recoveriescharges net in the consolidated statements of earningsloss 

fiscal 2022 pharmaceutical segment profit was positively impacted by a 16 million judgment for lost profits related to an ordinary course intellectual property rights claim 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2022 medical segment profit decreased largely due to net inflationary impacts which primarily related to increased transportation and commodities costs partially offset by price increases the adverse impact of global supply chain constraints and the divestiture of the cordis business the yearoveryear comparison of medical segment profit was also impacted favorably by the prioryear inventory reserve recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain ppe primarily certain categories of gloves to net realizable value and unfavorably by the prioryear net positive impact of ppe sales 

corporate 

the changes in corporate during fiscal 2022 are due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earningsloss section that follows 





other components of consolidated operating earningsloss 



in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed previously consolidated operating earningsloss were impacted by the following 



restructuring and employee severance 

in fiscal 2022 restructuring costs were primarily related to the implementation of certain enterprisewide costsavings measures which includes facility exit costs related to decreasing our overall office space and the divestiture of the cordis business 

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 311 million and 428 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively the decrease in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was primarily due to the divestiture of the cordis business 

impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets net 

during fiscal 2022 we recognized 21 billion of pretax noncash goodwill impairment charges related to our medical segment as discussed further in the critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates section of this mda and note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2021 we recognized a 60 million pretax writedown of the assets held for sale from the divestiture of the cordis business 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 we recognized estimated losses and legal defense costs associated with the ivc filter product liability claims of 87 million and 56 million respectively see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2022 we incurred a onetime contingent attorneys fee of 18 million related to the finalization of the settlement agreement resulting in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities due to the unique nature and significance of the settlement agreement and the onetime contingent nature of the fee this fee was included in litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 we recognized income of 18 million and 112 million respectively for recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member 

during fiscal 2021 we recognized pretax charges of 117 billion associated with certain opioid matters see significant developments in fiscal 2022 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2021 we recognized a 13 million charge in connection with a civil investigation by the united states attorney’s office for the district of massachusetts related to discounts and rebates offered or provided to certain specialty solutions customers as described further in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other components of earningsloss before income taxes 



in addition to the items discussed above earningsloss before income taxes was impacted by the following 



other incomeexpense net 

during fiscal 2022 other incomeexpense net was unfavorable compared to the prioryear period primarily due to a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments which offsets fluctuations included within sga expenses and is discussed further in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the yearoveryear comparison was also adversely impacted from net losses on investments in nonmarketable equity securities recognized during fiscal 2022 compared to net gains recognized in fiscal 2021 





interest expense net 

fiscal 2022 interest expense decreased from fiscal 2021 primarily due to less debt outstanding 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 we recognized losses of 10 million and 14 million respectively in connection with the redemption and early debt repurchases as described further in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes 



fluctuations in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charges recognized in the medical segment in fiscal 2022 the opioid litigation accrual recognized in fiscal 2021 as well as the impact of the carryback claim filed in accordance with the cares act provision in fiscal year 2021 

a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 



1 the table represents the following fiscal 2022 is pretax loss with tax expense and fiscal 2021 is pretax income with tax benefit 

2 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 

3 includes the tax impact of global intangible lowtaxed income gilti tax the foreignderived intangible income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the us tax code 

fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 



during fiscal 2022 and 2021 the effective tax rate was 212 percent and 897 percent respectively included in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 150 million of benefit related to the impairment of goodwill within the medical segment included in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was a 424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily related to a selfinsurance pretax loss and net tax benefits related to the treatment of the tax impacts of the fiscal 2021 opioid litigation charges  

tax effects of goodwill impairment charge 

during fiscal 2022 we recognized yeartodate cumulative pretax charges of 21 billion for goodwill impairment related to the medical unit the net tax benefit related to these charges was 150 million for fiscal 2022 

tax effects of selfinsurance pretax loss 

during fiscal 2021 our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and applied to adjust our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the cares act enacted by the united states congress in march 2020 

accordingly our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2021 included a 424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily to reflect the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate during the fiscal years from 2015 to 2018 35 percent for fiscal 2015 2016 and 2017 and 28 percent for fiscal 2018 and the current federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent 





during fiscal 2022 we received a us federal income tax refund of 966 million in connection with this matter we also increased our noncurrent deferred tax liability by approximately 700 million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter 

tax effect of opioid litigation charges 

the net tax benefits associated with the opioid litigation charges were 228 million for fiscal 2021 our tax benefits are estimates which reflect our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation and are net of unrecognized tax benefits of 219 million the fiscal 2021 net tax benefit and unrecognized tax benefits were primarily due to our assessment of the specific terms of the settlement agreement our assumptions and estimates around this benefit and uncertain tax position require significant judgment and the actual amount of tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates 

ongoing audits 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations new challenges related to future audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based on available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion contractual obligations and cash requirements tax payments current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases and known opioid litigation settlement payments if we decide to engage in one or more acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 47 billion at june 30 2022 compared to 34 billion at june 30 2021 net cash provided by operating activities includes a refund of 966 million for the tax benefit from the net operating loss carryback related to a selfinsurance pretax loss and reflects the impact of 417 million of payments related to the settlement agreement the settlement agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities payments under the separate new york ohio and rhode island settlements as well as certain payments under the cherokee nation settlement fiscal 2022 operating cash flow was also impacted by favorable timing of net working capital and we expect some of this favorability to be offset in fiscal 2023 we also received proceeds of 923 million net of cash transferred from the divestiture of the cordis business we deployed 10 billion for share repurchases 885 million for debt repayments 559 million for dividends and 387 million for capital expenditures at june 30 2022 our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

during fiscal 2021 our cash and equivalents increased due to 24 billion of net cash provided by operating activities offset by cash deployed of 573 million for dividends 570 million for debt repayments 400 million for capital expenditures and 200 million for share repurchases 

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases payments to vendors and tax payments in the regular course of business as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2022 included 588 million of cash and equivalents held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 

in june 2022 we returned 160 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the us 

at june 30 2022 foreign earnings of approximately 833 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs the computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable for amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2022 

other financing arrangements and financial instruments 



credit facilities and commercial paper

the redemption and repurchases were paid for with available cash and other shortterm borrowings 

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as note 1 and note 10 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures

variable price provisions and approximate timing of the transaction the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table in addition contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period purchase obligations and other payments also includes quarterly payments to cvs health in connection with red oak sourcing see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

5 represents future cash obligations under the settlement agreement which became effective on april 2 2022 as well as future cash obligations under the separate settlement agreements with the states of oklahoma washington and west virginia and the cherokee nation we have 636 billion accrued at june 30 2022 of which 532 million is included in other accrued liabilities and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets excluded from the table is 41 million that remained in escrow at june 30 2022 which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the settlement agreement includes a cash component pursuant to which we will pay up to approximately 60 billion the majority of which is expected to be paid over 18 years the exact payment amount will depend on several factors including the extent to which states take action to foreclose opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions eg by passing laws barring or limiting opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions the conditions of the state agreements being satisfied and the extent to which additional political subdivisions in participating states continue to litigate against us see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

6 longterm liabilities such as unrecognized tax benefits deferred taxes and other tax liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflows see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 



the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging historical writeoff trends payment history pricing discrepancies industry trends customer financial strength customer credit ratings or bankruptcies we regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts 

a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2022 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 11 million we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2022 are appropriate 

at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future 

increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue the following table presents information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

inventories 



lifo inventory 

a portion of our inventories 52 percent and 50 percent at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment “distribution facilities” the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earningsloss depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend historically prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise resulting in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for inventories 

using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an 

increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost 

we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively inventories valued at lifo cost were 416 million and 565 million higher than the average cost value we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not writeup the value of our inventory from average cost to lifo cost at june 30 2022 or 2021 

fifo inventory 

our remaining inventory including inventory in our medical segment that is not valued at the lower of lifo cost or market is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout fifo method or net realizable value we reserve for the lower of cost or net realizable value using the estimated selling prices and estimated sales demand in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation due to the unprecedented demand for certain ppe 





as a result of the covid19 pandemic covid19 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 our medical segment manufactured and sourced inventory at higher costs than in periods prior to covid19 as selling prices and customer demand decreased compared to the peak of covid19 we recorded a reserve of 197 million in fiscal 2021 primarily related to certain categories of gloves to reduce the carrying value of certain ppe to its net realizable value the remaining reserve at june 30 2022 was 42 million primarily due to sales of certain ppe during fiscal 2022 our estimates for selling prices and demand are inherently uncertain and if our assumptions decline in the future additional inventory reserves may be required 

excess and obsolete inventory 

we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific categories of inventory age and expiration dates of onhand inventory and manufacturer return policies inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 147 million and 185 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount there is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for the annual goodwill impairment test in the current year the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions which are components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear and precision health solutions division nuclear and precision health solutions division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health athome solutions division “medical unit” and cardinal health athome solutions division 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and if necessary the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit 

our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches using discount rates ranging from 10 to 12 percent we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our 

internallydeveloped forecasts under the marketbased guideline public company method we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets we also use the marketbased guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions changes in the industry or peer groups or changes in weightings assigned to the discounted cash flow method guideline public company method or guideline transaction method could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment if a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or operating cash flow or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 and with the exception of the medical unit in fiscal 2022 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

medical unit goodwill 

during fiscal 2022 the medical unit experienced adverse financial results related to inflationary impacts and the adverse impact of global supply chain constraints and lower volumes from ppe due to the risks and uncertainties related to these impacts and an increase in the riskfree interest rate used in the discount rate we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the medical unit at june 30 2022 this quantitative testing resulted in the carrying amount of the medical unit exceeding the fair value resulting in a pretax impairment charge of 303 million and cumulative pretax impairment charges of 21 billion recognized during fiscal 2022 due to the impairment charges recognized during the third and second quarters of fiscal 2022 as described further below this 





impairment charge was driven by an increase in the discount rate primarily due to an increase in the riskfree interest rate our determination of the estimated fair value of the medical unit was based on a combination of the incomebased approach and the marketbased approach for this testing performed at june 30 2022 we used a discount rate of 10 percent and a terminal growth rate of 2 percent additionally we assigned a weighting of 80 percent to the discounted cash flow method 10 percent to the guideline public company method and 10 percent to the guideline transaction method the carrying value of the medical unit at june 30 2022 after recognizing the impairment charges was 70 billion of which 19 billion was goodwill see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

during the third and second quarters of fiscal 2022 we performed interim goodwill impairment testing for the medical unit at march 31 2022 and december 31 2021 which resulted in pretax impairment charges of 474 million and 13 billion respectively our determination of the estimated fair value of the medical unit was based on a combination of the incomebased approach using a terminal growth rate of 2 percent and the marketbased approach for the incomebased approach we also used discount rates of 95 percent and 9 percent for the interim testing at march 31 2022 and december 31 2021 respectively the increase in the discount rate was primarily due to an increase in the riskfree interest rate 

while we consider these assumptions to be reasonable and appropriate they are complex and subjective and additional adverse changes in one key assumption or a combination of key assumptions may significantly affect future estimates these assumptions include among other things a failure to meet expected earnings or other financial plans or unanticipated events and circumstances such as changes in assumptions about the 

duration and magnitude of increased supply chain and commodities costs and our planned efforts to mitigate such impact including price increases or surcharges further disruptions in the supply chain the impact of the cordis divestiture estimated demand and selling prices for ppe an increase in the discount rate a decrease in the terminal growth rate increases in tax rates including potential tax reform or a significant change in industry or economic trends adverse changes in key assumptions may result in further decline in fair value below the carrying value in the future and therefore an impairment of our medical unit goodwill in future periods which could adversely affect our results of operations for example if we were to increase the discount rate by a hypothetical 05 percent or decrease the terminal growth rate by a hypothetical 175 percent the fair value for the medical unit would have further decreased by approximately 330 million 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if so then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the respective assets carrying amount our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 

see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

loss contingencies and selfinsurance 



we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

loss contingencies 

we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

examples of such contingencies include various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the ivc filter lawsuits 

in connection with the opioid litigation as described further in the significant developments in fiscal 2022 and trends section in this mda we recorded pretax charges of 117 billion during fiscal 2021 in february 2022 we and two other national distributors announced that each company had determined that a sufficient 

number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the previously disclosed settlement agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities this settlement agreement became effective on april 2 2022 

we develop and periodically update reserve estimates for the ivc claims including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs to project future ivc claim costs we use a methodology based largely on recent experience including claim filing rates estimated severity by claim type historical sales data implant and injury to report lag patterns and estimated defense costs 

selfinsurance 

we selfinsure through a whollyowned insurance subsidiary for employee healthcare certain product liability matters auto liability property and workers compensation and maintain insurance for losses exceeding certain limits 

selfinsurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs administrative fees 





claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information related to each claim if available other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period 

the amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits 

we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

provision for income taxes 



we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



1 total deferred income tax assets included 778 million and 805 million of loss and tax credit carryforwards at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

2 the valuation allowance primarily relates to federal state and international loss and credit carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 

expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described previously we operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

tax effects of goodwill impairment charges 

during fiscal 2022 we recognized cumulative pretax charges of 21 billion for goodwill impairments related to the medical unit the net tax benefit related to these charges was 150 million 

tax effects of selfinsurance pretax loss 

during fiscal 2021 our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and applied to adjust our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the cares act enacted by the united states congress in march 2020 

accordingly our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2021 included a 424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily to reflect the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate during the fiscal years from 2015 to 2018 35 percent for fiscal 2015 2016 and 2017 and 28 percent for fiscal 2018 and the current federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent 

we filed for a us federal income tax refund of 974 million as a result of the net operating loss carryback under the cares act in april 2022 we received a payment for 966 million which was net of certain adjustments see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail we also increased our noncurrent deferred tax liability by approximately 700 million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter 

tax effects of opioid litigation charges 

in connection with the 117 billion pretax charges for the opioid litigation during fiscal year 2021 respectively we recorded a tax benefit of 228 million our tax benefits are estimates which reflect our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation and are net of unrecognized tax benefits of 219 million 

we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act however these estimates require significant judgment since the us tax law 





governing deductibility was changed by the tax act further it is possible congress or the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits the actual amount of the tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations during fiscal 2021 we resolved all open issues with respect to the company’s activity within fiscal years 2008 through 2014 with the us internal revenue service irs this resolution resulted in an adjustment to our provision for income taxes including an impact to reserves for later years new challenges related to future audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets for a further discussion on provision for income taxes see note 8 of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the us tax code as per the tax act as enacted by the united states government on december 22 2017 we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the tax act which is subject to further interpretation by the irs see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 





explanation and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

this report including the fiscal 2022 overview section within mda contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap 

in addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate our performance engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and in some circumstances are more closely correlated to the performance of our underlying ongoing business we provide these nongaap financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a yearoveryear basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors however the nongaap financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated 

exclusions from nongaap financial measures 

management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the nongaap measures presented in this report for its own and for investors’ assessment of the business for the reasons identified below 

• lifo charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive lastin firstout lifo inventory charges or credits such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted the exclusion of lifo charges and credits from nongaap metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies’ financial results we did not recognize any lifo charges or credits during the periods presented 

• surgical gown recall costs or income includes inventory writeoffs and certain remediation and supply disruption costs net of related insurance recoveries arising from the january 2020 recall of select association for the advancement of medical instrumentation aami level 3 surgical gowns and voluntary field actions a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs for presource procedure packs containing affected gowns income from surgical gown recall costs represents insurance recoveries of these certain costs we have excluded these costs from our nongaap metrics to allow investors to better understand the underlying operating results of the business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies’ financial results 

• state opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years is the portion of state assessments for prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in periods prior to the period in which the expense is incurred this portion is excluded from nongaap financial measures because it is retrospectively applied to sales in prior fiscal years and inclusion would obscure analysis of the current fiscal year results of our underlying ongoing business additionally while states laws may require us to make payments on an ongoing basis the portion of the assessment related to sales in prior periods are contemplated to be onetime nonrecurring items income from state opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years represents reversals of accruals when the underlying assessments were invalidated by a court or reimbursed by manufacturers 

• restructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business 

• amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs  which include transaction costs integration costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies financial results additionally costs for amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets are noncash amounts which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical current and forecasted financial results we also exclude other acquisitionrelated costs which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity’s initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation these costs are also significantly impacted by the timing complexity and size of acquisitions 





• impairments and gain or loss on disposal of assets are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount and in the case of impairments are noncash amounts so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical current and forecasted financial results 

• litigation recoveries or charges net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount during fiscal 2022 we incurred a onetime contingent attorneys fee of 18 million related to the finalization of the settlement agreement the “settlement agreement” resulting in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities due to the unique nature and significance of the settlement agreement and the onetime contingent nature of the fee this fee was included in litigation recoveries or charges net additionally during fiscal 2022 our pharmaceutical segment profit was positively impacted by a 16 million judgment for lost profits this judgment was the result of an ordinary course intellectual property rights claim and therefore is not adjusted in calculating the litigation recoveries or charges net adjustment during fiscal 2021 we incurred a tax benefit related to a carryback of a net operating loss some pretax amounts which contributed to this loss relate to litigation charges as a result we allocated substantially all of the tax benefit to litigation charges 

• loss on early extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance additionally the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions 

• gainloss on sale of equity interest in navihealth was incurred in connection with the sale of our remaining equity interest in navihealth in fiscal 2020 the equity interest was retained in connection with the initial sale of our majority interest in navihealth during fiscal 2019 we exclude this significant gain because gains or losses on investments of this magnitude do not typically occur in the normal course of business and are similar in nature to a gain or loss from a divestiture of a majority interest which we exclude from nongaap results the gain on the initial sale of our majority interest in navihealth in fiscal 2019 was also excluded from our nongaap measures 

• transitional tax benefit net related to the tax cuts and jobs act is excluded because it results from the onetime impact of a very significant change in the us federal corporate tax rate and due to the significant size of the benefit obscures analysis of trends and financial performance the transitional tax benefit includes the initial estimate and subsequent adjustments for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings 

the tax effect for each of the items listed above other than the transitional tax benefit item is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdictions in which the item is recorded the gross tax and net impact of each item are presented with our gaap to nongaap reconciliations

3 impairments and gainloss on disposals of assets net includes pretax goodwill impairment charges of 21 billion related to the medical segment recorded during fiscal 2022 for fiscal 2022 the net tax benefit related to these charges is 150 million and is included in the annual effective tax rate 

4 litigation recoveriescharges net includes a onetime contingent attorneys fee of 18 million recorded during fiscal 2022 related to the finalization of the settlement agreement resulting in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities due to the unique nature and significance of the settlement agreement and the onetime contingent nature of the fee this fee was included in litigation recoveriescharges net

litigation recoveriescharges net includes a tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2021 related to a net operating loss carryback our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and adjusted our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act the total benefit from the net operating loss carryback was 424 million however for purposes of nongaap financial measures we allocated 389 million of the benefit to litigation recoveriescharges net which is excluded from nongaap measures based on the relative amount of the selfinsurance pretax loss related to opioid litigation claims versus separate tax adjustments the tax benefit allocated to the separate tax adjustments of 35 million is included in nongaap measures

medical unit goodwill description of the matter 

at june 30 2022 goodwill related to the company’s medical segment including the medical unit was 32 billion as discussed in notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or when indicators of impairment exist during fiscal 2022 the company recognized goodwill impairment charges related to the medical unit of 21 billion 

auditing management’s goodwill impairment test for the medical unit was challenging because there is significant judgement required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit in particular the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant judgmental assumptions including the revenue growth rate gross margin distribution selling general and administrative expenses and companyspecific risk premium which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions

how we addressed the matter in our audit 

we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company’s goodwill impairment review process for example we tested controls over management’s review of significant judgmental assumptions including the revenue growth rate gross margin distribution selling general and administrative expenses and companyspecific risk premium among other assumptions 

to test the estimated fair value of the company’s medical unit we performed audit procedures that included among others evaluating methodologies used involving our valuation specialists in testing the significant assumptions described above and testing the underlying data used by the company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends recent historical performance changes to the reporting unit’s business model customer base or product mix and other relevant factors we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions we evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the model and tested the model’s computational accuracy in addition we inspected the company’s reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the company and assessed the result we have also assessed the adequacy of the company’s disclosures included in notes 1 and 4 in relation to this matter 

product liability lawsuits 

description of the matter 

as described in notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company is a defendant in various product liability claims in which individuals seek damages associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava ivc filter products the company accrues for losses and defense costs related to product liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the methodology used by the company to project future cordis ivc claim costs is based largely on recent experience including claim filing rates indemnity severity by claim type sales data implant and injury to report lag patterns and defense costs the company periodically reviews such estimates and records adjustments for changes in reserves in the period in which the change in estimate occurs at june 30 2022 the company’s product liability reserve balance related to the cordis ivc lawsuits totaled 512 million net of estimated insurance recoveries the company believes there is a range of estimated losses with respect to these matters because no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range the company has accrued the minimum amount in the range the company estimates the high end of the range to be approximately 105 billion net of estimated insurance recoveries 

auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies related to the cordis ivc product liability lawsuits was challenging due to the significant judgment required to develop the key assumptions utilized to calculate the estimated losses and the nature of information available given the early stages of these lawsuits and the limited claims and settlement history 

how we addressed the matter in our audit 

we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management’s evaluation of the product liability litigation reserve for example we tested controls over management’s review of the loss calculation used to estimate the product liability reserve amount and the significant assumptions as described above used within the loss calculation we also tested management’s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the loss calculation 

to test management’s assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable we evaluated for example claims data of the company we evaluated the legal letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel and we discussed the plaintiffs claims with internal and external legal counsel among other procedures we performed to test the measurement of the product liability litigation reserve we evaluated the method of measuring the reserve for claims including analyses to determine the range of possible losses tested the accuracy and completeness of the data and evaluated new or contrary information affecting the estimate in addition we involved internal actuarial specialists to assist with our procedures related to the measurement of the product liability reserve we have also assessed the adequacy of the company’s disclosures included in note 7 in relation to these matters 

uncertain tax positions 

description of the matter 

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to its uncertain tax positions were approximately 943 million at june 30 2022 uncertain tax positions may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation the company uses significant judgment in 1 determining if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and 2 measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition 

auditing managements estimate of the amount of tax benefit related to the companys uncertain tax positions that qualified for recognition was challenging because managements estimate required significant judgment in evaluating the technical merits of the positions including interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations 

cardinal health  fiscal 2022 form 10k 

reports 

how we addressed the matter in our audit 

we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company’s process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain tax positions including the company’s assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions we involved our international tax transfer pricing and national tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the company’s tax positions depending on the nature of the specific tax position and where applicable developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto our procedures included obtaining and examining the company’s analysis for example we evaluated the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based and where applicable obtained the company’s correspondence with local tax authorities we used our knowledge of international and local income tax laws as well as historical settlement activity where applicable with local income tax authorities to evaluate the company’s accounting for its uncertain tax positions we evaluated developments in the applicable tax jurisdictions to assess potential effects on the company’s positions we analyzed the company’s assumptions and data used to evaluate the appropriateness of the company’s measurement of tax benefits we have also evaluated the company’s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters opioid lawsuits 

description of the matter 

as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state governments native american tribes and other political subdivisions related to opioid matters the company accrues for losses related to legal matters at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in february 2022 the company determined that that a sufficient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the settlement agreement the settlement agreement became effective on april 2 2022  in addition the native american tribes and certain other subdivisions are not included within the settlement agreement and are negotiated separately the company has accrued 636 billion pretax under the cash component of the settlement agreement and for negotiations with native american tribes and other subdivisions as of june 30 2022 the company is unable to reasonably estimate the liability associated with other plaintiffs that are not subject to the settlement agreement or other ongoing negotiations additionally management is unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with these matters 

auditing the company’s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies related to the opioid lawsuits was challenging due to the significant judgment required to evaluate management’s assessment of the likelihood of a loss being incurred and management’s determination of whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss can be made 

how we addressed the matter in our audit 

we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of this legal contingency for example we tested controls over management’s review of the assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable and whether the assessment considered all relevant facts 

to test the company’s assessment of the probability of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable among other procedures we read the settlement agreement evaluated the legal letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel met with internal counsel to discuss the status of the proceedings and negotiations of the settlement agreement and negotiations with other plaintiffs and evaluated the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable we also assessed the adequacy and the sufficiency of the company’s disclosures included in note 7 in relation to these matters

use of estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates judgments and assumptions are used in the accounting and disclosure related to among other items allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and reserves goodwill and other intangible asset impairment vendor reserves loss contingencies including product liability and selfinsurance accruals and income taxes actual amounts may differ from these estimated amounts 

cash equivalents 

we consider liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value 

receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  273 million and  243 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively an account is considered past due on the first day after its due date in accordance with contract terms we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due we regularly monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to 

cover potential losses and consider historical experience pricing discrepancies the current economic environment customer credit ratings or bankruptcies and reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop our allowance for credit losses we review these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts 

we provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 1 year to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes net and related accrued interest were  63 million current portion  12 million and  63 million current portion  7 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets finance notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts were  8 million and  12 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively we estimate an allowance for these financing receivables based on historical collection rates and the creditworthiness of the customer we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts

we maintain cash depository accounts with major banks and we invest in high quality shortterm liquid instruments and in marketable securities our shortterm liquid instruments mature within three months and we have not historically incurred any related losses 

our trade receivables and finance notes and related accrued interest are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with certain large customers and with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry with respect to customers in the retail and healthcare sectors such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base including its wide geographic dispersion we perform regular credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and maintain reserves for losses through the established allowance for doubtful accounts historically such losses have been within our expectations refer to the receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts section within this note for additional information on the accounting treatment of reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts

we have entered into agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” which act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members vizient inc and premier inc are our two largest gpo member relationships in terms of revenue sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 19 percent 19 percent and 21 percent of revenue for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the gpo and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangements  

inventories 

a portion of our inventories  52 percent and 50 percent at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our pharmaceutical segment “distribution facilities” and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 

at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively inventories valued at lifo cost were  416 million and  565 million higher than the average cost value we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not writeup the value of our inventory from average cost to lifo cost at june 30 2022 or 2021 

our remaining inventory including inventory in our medical segment that is not valued at the lower of lifo cost or market is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or net realizable value net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices and estimated sales demand in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation due to the unprecedented demand for certain personal protective equipment as a result of the covid19 pandemic covid19 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 our medical segment manufactured and sourced inventory at higher costs than in periods prior to covid19 personal protective equipment ppe refers to protective clothing medical and nonmedical 

grade gloves face shields face masks and other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness as selling prices and customer demand decreased compared to the peak of covid19 during fiscal 2021 we recorded a reserve of  197 million primarily related to certain categories of gloves to reduce the carrying value of certain ppe to its net realizable value the reserve balance was  42 million at june 30 2022 

we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific categories of inventory age and expiration dates of onhand inventory and manufacturer return policies inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were  147 million and  185 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

cash discounts 

manufacturer cash discounts are recorded as a component of inventory cost and recognized as a reduction of cost of products sold as inventory is sold 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation property and equipment held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation before the decision to dispose of the asset was made or fair value less cost to sell when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts 

we capitalize project costs relating to computer software developed or obtained for internal use when the activities related to the project reach the application stage costs that are associated with the preliminary stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as they are incurred 

depreciation expense is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets including finance lease assets which are depreciated over the terms of their respective leases we generally use the following range of useful lives for our property and equipment categories buildings and improvements— 3 to 39 years machinery and equipment— 3 to 20 years capitalized software held for internal use— 3 to 7 years and furniture and fixtures— 3 to 7 years we recorded depreciation and amortization expense of  412 million  377 million and  405 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively

repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred interest on longterm projects is capitalized using a rate that approximates the weightedaverage interest rate on longterm obligations which was 4 percent at june 30 2022 the amount of capitalized interest was immaterial for all periods presented 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 

purchased goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount there is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test in the current year the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and if necessary the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear and precision health solutions division nuclear and precision health solutions division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health athome solutions division “medical unit” and cardinal health athome solutions division 

fair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated 

over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 10 to 12 percent under the marketbased guideline public company method we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets we also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including forecasted operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 and with the exception of our medical unit in fiscal 2022 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as discussed further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2022 we recognized goodwill impairment charges related to our medical unit of  21 billion respectively which are included in impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings there were tax benefits related to these goodwill impairment charges see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if so then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the respective assets carrying amount our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 

intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks trade names and patents and developed technology are amortized using a combination of straightline and accelerated 

cardinal health  fiscal 2022 form 10k 

notes to financial statements 

methods based on the expected cash flows from the asset over their estimated useful lives we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the future forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts 

assets held for sale 

we classify assets and liabilities the “disposal group” as held for sale when management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group in its present condition and at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value we also consider whether an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated and if it is probable that the sale will occur within one year without significant changes to the plan to sell upon classification of the disposal group as held for sale we test the assets for impairment and cease related depreciation and amortization 

on march 12 2021 we signed a definitive agreement with hellman  friedman to sell the cordis business upon signing the agreement we met the criteria for the related assets and liabilities of the cordis business to be classified as held for sale in august 2021 we sold the cordis business to hellman  friedman for proceeds of  923 million net of cash transferred and we retained certain working capital accounts and certain liabilities see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information cardinal health retained product liability associated with lawsuits and claims related to inferior vena cava ivc filters in the us and canada as well as authority for these matters discussed in note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

investments 

investments in nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for under the fair value equity or net asset value method of accounting and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value we use the fair value measurement alternative and measure the securities at cost less impairment if any including adjustments for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer for investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control we use the equity method of accounting our share of the earnings and losses are recorded in other incomeexpense net in the consolidated statements of earningsloss we monitor our investments for impairment by considering factors such as the operating performance of the investment and current economic and market conditions 

leases 

our operating leases are primarily for corporate offices distribution facilities vehicles and equipment we determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception by evaluating whether the arrangement conveys the right to use an identified asset and whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from and have the ability to direct the use of the asset our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants 

operating lease rightofuse assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term operating lease expense for operating lease assets is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments we use the implicit rate if it is readily determinable 

our lease agreements contain lease components and nonlease components for all asset classes we have elected to account for both of these components as a single lease component we also from time to time sublease portions of our real estate property resulting in sublease income sublease income and the related assets and cash flows are not material to the consolidated financial statements at or for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 

we also have elected to apply a practical expedient for shortterm leases whereby we do not recognize a lease liability and rightofuse asset for leases with a term of less than 12 months shortterm lease expense recognized in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 was not material 

our leases have remaining lease terms from less than 1 year up to approximately 20 years our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain and there is a significant economic incentive to exercise that option 

see note 5 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding leases 

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes these disputes are researched and resolved based upon the findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the claim types are relatively consistent we periodically update our reserve estimates to reflect actual historical experience the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold in addition 

  64 

cardinal health  fiscal 2022 form 10k 

notes to financial statements 

the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues vendor reserves were  105 million and  77 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively excluding thirdparty returns see thirdparty returns section within this note for a description of thirdparty returns 

distribution services agreement and other vendor fees 

our pharmaceutical segment recognizes fees received from distribution services agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors’ inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment since the benefit provided to a vendor is related to the purchase and distribution of the vendor’s inventory we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees and as such a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earningsloss when the inventory is sold 

loss contingencies and selfinsurance 

loss contingencies 

we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 

in connection with the opioid litigation as described further in the note 7  we recorded pretax charges of  117 billion and  563 billion during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively which were retained at corporate in february 2022 we and two other national distributors announced that each company had determined that a sufficient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the previously disclosed settlement agreement the settlement agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities this settlement agreement became effective on april 2 2022 

we develop and periodically update reserve estimates for the ivc claims including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs to project future ivc claim costs we use a methodology based largely on recent experience including claim filing rates estimated indemnity severity by claim type historical sales data implant and injury to report lag patterns and estimated defense costs 

the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from these estimates we recognize these estimated loss contingencies income from favorable resolution of litigation and certain defense costs in litigation recoveriescharges in our consolidated statements of earningsloss see note 7 for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits 

selfinsurance 

we selfinsure for employee healthcare general liability certain product liability matters auto liability property and workers compensation selfinsurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements or pending claims defense costs 

administrative fees claim adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 

because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies and other liabilities is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies and our selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

guarantees 

in the ordinary course of business we agree to indemnify certain other parties under acquisition and disposition agreements customer agreements intellectual property licensing agreements and other agreements such indemnification obligations vary in scope and when defined in duration in many cases a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated where appropriate such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability historically we have not individually or in the aggregate made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts in certain circumstances we believe that existing insurance arrangements subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations in addition we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not probable 

from time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the acquired business generally the obligation is capped at an explicit amount there were no material obligations at june 30 2022 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate we assess the realizability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realizability of deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction and also considers all available positive and negative evidence 

deferred taxes for nonus liabilities are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested 

cardinal health  fiscal 2022 form 10k 

notes to financial statements 

we operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

see note 8 for additional information regarding income taxes 

other accrued liabilities 

other accrued liabilities represent various current obligations including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payable 

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests represent the portion of net earnings comprehensive income and net assets that is not attributable to cardinal health inc 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation provided to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earningsloss based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the fair value of stock options is determined on the grant date using a lattice valuation model the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the compensation expense recognized for sharebased awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized ratably over the service period of the awards all income tax effects of sharebased awards are recognized in the consolidated statements of earningsloss as awards vest or are settled we classify sharebased compensation expense in distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees if awards are modified in connection with a restructuring activity the incremental sharebased compensation expense is classified in restructuring and employee severance see note 14 for additional information regarding sharebased compensation 

dividends 

we paid cash dividends per common share of  196   194 and  192 in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers 

revenue in both segments is primarily related to the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products which include both manufactured and sourced products and we recognize at a point in time when title transfers to customers and we have no further obligation to provide services related to such merchandise service revenues are recognized over the period that services are provided to the customer revenues derived from services are not material for either segment for all periods presented 

we are generally the principal in a transaction therefore our revenue is primarily recorded on a gross basis when we are a principal in a transaction we have determined that we control the ability to direct the use of the product or service prior to transfer to a customer are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product or service to our customer have discretion in establishing prices and ultimately control the transfer of the product or services provided to the customer 

sales returns and allowances 

revenue is recorded net of sales returns and allowances revenues are measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive reduced by estimates for return allowances discounts rebates and other variable consideration sales returns are recorded based on estimates using historical data our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products for credit in a condition suitable to be added back to inventory and resold at full value “merchantable product” or returned to vendors for credit product returns are generally consistent throughout the year and typically are not specific to any particular product or customer 

we accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical customer return trends margin rates and processing costs our accrual for sales returns is reflected as a reduction of revenue and cost of products sold for the sales price and cost respectively at june 30 2022 and 2021 the accrual for estimated sales returns and allowances was  617 million and  689 million respectively which is reflected in trade receivables net and inventories net in the consolidated balance sheets sales returns and allowances were  24 billion  26 billion and  23 billion for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively and the net impact on net earningsloss in the consolidated statements of earningsloss was immaterial in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 

thirdparty returns 

we generally do not accept nonmerchantable pharmaceutical product returns from our customers so many of our customers return nonmerchantable pharmaceutical products to the manufacturer through third parties since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with manufacturers our vendors pass the value of such returns to us usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction we in turn pass the value received to our customer in certain instances we pass the estimated value of the return to our customer prior to our receipt of the value from the vendor although we believe we have satisfactory protections we could be subject to claims from customers or vendors if our administration of this overall process was deficient in some respect

cardinal health  fiscal 2022 form 10k 

notes to financial statements 

or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers we have maintained reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their resolution 

shipping and handling 

shipping and handling costs are primarily included in sga expenses in our consolidated statements of earningsloss and include all delivery expenses as well as all costs to prepare the product for shipment to the end customer shipping and handling costs were  748 million  634 million and  620 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

restructuring and employee severance 

restructuring activities are programs that are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business such as divestitures closing and consolidating facilities changing the way we manufacture or distribute our products moving manufacturing of a product to another location changes in production or business process outsourcing or insourcing employee severance including rationalizing headcount or other significant changes in personnel and realigning operations including realignment of the management structure in response to changing market conditions also included within restructuring and employee severance are employee severance costs that are not incurred in connection with a restructuring activity see note 3 for additional information regarding our restructuring activities 

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

we classify certain costs incurred in connection with acquisitions as amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs in our consolidated statements of earningsloss these costs consist of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets transaction costs integration costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations transaction costs are incurred during the initial evaluation of a potential acquisition and primarily relate to costs to analyze negotiate and consummate the transaction as well as due diligence activities integration costs relate to activities required to combine the operations of an acquired enterprise into our operations and in the case of the cordis and patient recovery businesses to standup the systems and processes needed to support an expanded geographic footprint we record changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations relating to acquisitions as income or expense in amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs see note 4 for additional information regarding amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

translation of foreign currencies 

financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are accumulated in shareholders’ equity through accumulated and other comprehensive loss aoci utilizing periodend exchange rates revenues and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries are translated using average exchange rates during the year 

the foreign currency translation gainslosses included in aoci at june 30 2022 and 2021 are presented in note 11  foreign currency transaction gains and losses for the period are included in the consolidated statements of earningsloss in the respective financial statement line item 

interest rate currency and commodity risk 

all derivative instruments are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and all changes in fair value are recognized in net earnings or shareholders’ equity through aoci net of tax 

for contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment the hedge contracts must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract hedge effectiveness is assessed periodically any contract not designated as a hedge or so designated but ineffective is adjusted to fair value and recognized immediately in net earnings if a fair value or cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment the contract continues to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled and future adjustments to the contract’s fair value are recognized immediately in net earnings if a forecasted transaction is probable not to occur amounts previously deferred in aoci are recognized immediately in net earnings interest payments received from the crosscurrency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense net in the consolidated statements of earningsloss 

see note 10 for additional information regarding our derivative instruments including the accounting treatment for instruments designated as fair value cash flow net investment and economic hedges 

fair value measurements 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon selling an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date it focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants a threetier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value this hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values are 

level 1  observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 

level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 

level 3  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities 

see note 9 for additional information regarding fair value measurements

2 divestitures and acquisitions 

divestitures 

cordis 

in august 2021 we sold the cordis business to hellman  friedman for proceeds of  923 million net of cash transferred and we retained certain working capital accounts and certain liabilities cardinal health retained product liability associated with lawsuits and claims related to ivc filters in the us and canada as well as authority for these matters discussed in note 7  the cordis business operated within our medical segment 

during fiscal 2021 we met the criteria for the related assets and liabilities of the cordis business to be classified as held for sale we determined that the sale of the cordis business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations in connection with the divestiture we recognized a  60 million pretax loss in impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statement of earningsloss in fiscal 2021 

navihealth 

in august 2018 we sold our majority ownership interest in navihealth which operated within our medical segment in exchange for cash proceeds of  737 million after adjusting for certain fees and expenses and a noncontrolling equity interest in a partnership that owned navihealth we also had certain call rights to reacquire navihealth 

in may 2020 we sold the remainder of our noncontrolling equity interest in a partnership that owned navihealth we recognized a pretax gain of  579 million from this disposal in gain on sale of equity interest in navihealth in our consolidated statements of earningsloss during fiscal year 2020 

acquisitions 

we did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 2020 while we completed small acquisitions during fiscal 2022 and 2021 the pro forma results of operations and the results of operations for acquired businesses since the acquisition dates have not been separately disclosed because the effects were not significant compared to the consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate the cash paid for these acquisitions net of cash acquired was  22 million and  3 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively

during fiscal 2022 the medical unit experienced adverse financial results related to inflationary impacts and the adverse impact of global supply chain constraints and lower volumes from ppe due to the risks and uncertainties related to these impacts and an increase in the riskfree interest rate used in the discount rate we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the medical unit at june 30 2022 this quantitative testing resulted in the carrying amount of the medical unit exceeding the fair value resulting in a pretax impairment charge of  303 million and cumulative pretax impairment charges of  21 billion recognized during fiscal 2022 due to the impairment charges recognized during the third and second quarters of fiscal 2022 as described further below this impairment charge was driven by an increase in the discount rate primarily due to an increase in the riskfree interest rate our determination of the estimated fair value of the medical unit is based on a combination of the incomebased approach and the marketbased approach for this testing performed at june 30 2022 we used a discount rate of 10 percent and a terminal growth rate of 2 percent the goodwill balance of the medical unit after recognizing the impairment was  19 billion at june 30 2022 

during the third and second quarters of fiscal 2022 we performed interim goodwill impairment testing for the medical unit at march 31 2022 and december 31 2021 which resulted in pretax impairment charges of  13 billion and  474 million which were recognized during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022 respectively and are included in impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earningsloss our determination of the estimated fair value of the medical unit is based on a combination of the incomebased approach 

using a terminal growth rate of 2 percent and the marketbased approach for the incomebased approach we also used discount rates of 9 percent and 95 percent for the interim testing during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022 respectively the increase in the discount rate was primarily due to an increase in the riskfree interest rate our fair value estimates utilize significant unobservable inputs and thus represent level 3 fair value measurements 

in connection with the divestiture of the cordis business during fiscal 2021 we allocated and reclassified  388 million of goodwill from the medical unit within our medical segment to the cordis disposal group based on the estimated relative fair values of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that was retained

contingencies 

new york opioid stewardship act 

in april 2018 the state of new york passed a budget which included the opioid stewardship act the osa the osa created an aggregate  100 million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in new york under the osa each licensed manufacturer and distributor would be required to pay a portion of the assessment based on its share of the total morphine milligram equivalents sold or distributed in new york during the applicable calendar year beginning in 2017 

the constitutionality of portions of the osa has been challenged in court in december 2018 the osa was ruled unconstitutional by the us district court for the southern district of new york subsequently new york passed a new statute that modified the assessment going forward and limited the osa to two years 2017 and 2018 the us court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the district courts decision on procedural grounds 

we accrue contingencies if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be estimated because of the second circuit ruling we recorded an aggregate accrual of  41 million for calendar years 2017 and 2018 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 based on the probable estimated payment amount in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 we paid the state of new york approximately  20 million our portion of the assessment for calendar year 2017 as a result as of june 30 2022 we had an accrual of  20 million which reflects our best estimate of the portion of the assessment that we may owe for sales during calendar year 2018 

legal proceedings 

we become involved from time to time in disputes litigation and regulatory matters 

from time to time we determine that products we source manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a potential quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action such actions have led to product recalls costs to repair or replace affected 

products temporary interruptions in product sales restrictions on importation product liability claims and lawsuits and can lead to action by regulators even absent an identified regulatory or quality issue or product recall we can become subject to product liability claims and lawsuits 

from time to time we become aware through employees internal audits or other parties of possible compliance matters such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting internal accounting controls financial reporting auditing or other ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws such as healthcare fraud and abuse anticorruption or antibribery laws when we become aware of such possible compliance matters we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action in addition from time to time we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various federal or state agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer supplier or other industry participants internal investigations subpoenas or requests for information could directly or indirectly lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us or result in sanctions 

we have been named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties in such actions the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination if the government declines to intervene the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government 

we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates 

we recognize income from the favorable outcome of litigation when we receive the associated cash or assets 

we recognize estimated loss contingencies for certain litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of litigation in litigation recoveriescharges in our consolidated statements of earningsloss however losses and recoveries of lost profits from disputes that occur in the ordinary course of business are included within segment profit for example in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 our pharmaceutical segment profit was positively impacted by a  16 million judgment for lost profits related to an ordinary course intellectual property rights claim

opioid lawsuits and investigations 

states  political subdivisions 

national settlement 

beginning in fiscal year 2017 state attorneys general counties and municipalities began filing lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications against pharmaceutical wholesalers including us and other participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain these lawsuits sought equitable relief and monetary damages based on a variety of legal theories including various common law claims such as public nuisance negligence and unjust enrichment as well as violations of controlled substance laws the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and various other statutes the lawsuits filed by states and political subdivisions were filed by counties municipalities cities and political subdivisions in various federal state and other courts the vast majority of these lawsuits were filed in us federal court and were transferred for consolidated pretrial proceedings in a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the us district court for the northern district of ohio the “mdl” 

by fiscal year 2022 cardinal health was a defendant in approximately 2775 lawsuits brought by these plaintiffs in july 2021 we and two other national distributors collectively the distributors announced a proposed settlement with a group of state attorneys general intended to resolve the vast majority of these lawsuits the national settlement as well as a proposed settlement agreement the settlement agreement containing among other things a signon process to allow states and political subdivisions to participate in the national settlement 

in february 2022 the distributors each determined that a sufficient number of states and political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the national settlement to proceed with the settlement agreement the settlement agreement became effective on april 2 2022 

in addition to the distributors parties to the settlement agreement include 46 states the district of columbia and 5 us territories as of august 9 2022 over 99 percent of political subdivisions by population as calculated under the settlement agreement that had brought opioidrelated suits against us as calculated under the settlement agreement had chosen to join the settlement agreement or have had their claims addressed by state legislation 

under this settlement agreement we will pay up to approximately  60 billion the majority of which is expected to be paid over 18 years the exact payment amount will depend on several factors including the extent to which states take action to foreclose opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions  eg  by passing laws barring or limiting opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions and the extent to which additional political subdivisions in participating states file additional opioid lawsuits against us 

the settlement agreement also includes injunctive relief terms related to distributors’ controlled substance antidiversion programs including with respect to 1 governance 2 independence and training of the personnel operating controlled substances monitoring programs 3 due diligence for new and 

existing customers 4 ordering limits for certain products and 5 suspicious order monitoring a monitor will oversee compliance with these provisions for a period of five years in addition the distributors will engage a thirdparty vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting which distributors will fund for ten years 

the participating states and the distributors are cooperating to obtain consent judgments embodying the terms of the settlement agreement in each participating state and the participating states and subdivisions are dismissing their lawsuits as a result as of august 9 2022 approximately 2300 lawsuits against us have been dismissed we expect additional lawsuits to be dismissed over the coming months 

prior to the effective date of the settlement agreement distributors had entered into separate settlement agreements with each of the states of florida new york ohio and rhode island when the settlement agreement became effective each of these states and their participating subdivisions became a part of the national settlement however the new york ohio and rhode island agreements required us to make certain payments separately from those required by the settlement agreement 

during fiscal year ended june 30 2022 we made our first annual payment under the settlement agreement we also made certain payments under the separate new york ohio and rhode island settlements as well as certain payments under the cherokee nation settlement in total during fiscal year ended june 30 2022 we paid  417 million in connection with these matters in july 2022 we made our second annual payment of  374 million under the settlement agreement 

other settlements 

west virginia subdivisions and native american tribes were not a part of the national settlement and we had separate negotiations with these groups a bench trial before a federal judge in west virginia in a case brought by cabell county and city of huntington against the distributors concluded in july 2021 in july 2022 a judgment in favor of the distributors was entered in july 2022 the distributors reached an agreement to settle the opioidrelated claims of the majority of the remaining west virginia subdivisions under this agreement we have agreed to pay eligible west virginia subdivisions up to approximately  124 million over an elevenyear period this agreement is subject to certain contingencies related to subdivision participation 

in june 2022 the distributors reached an agreement with the state of oklahoma to resolve the opioidrelated claims of the state and its political subdivisions under this agreement cardinal health agreed to pay approximately  95 million to the state and its participating subdivisions this amount is consistent with the amount that would have been allocated to oklahoma under the settlement agreement the terms of this agreement are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement this agreement is subject to certain contingencies including the rate of subdivision participation 

cardinal health  fiscal 2022 form 10k 

notes to financial statements 

in may 2022 the distributors reached an agreement with the washington attorney general under which cardinal health will pay up to approximately  160 million to the state of washington and its participating subdivisions to resolve opioidrelated claims this amount is consistent with the amount that would have been allocated to washington under the settlement agreement plus certain attorneys fees and costs the terms of this agreement in principle are substantially consistent with the settlement agreement this agreement is subject to certain contingencies including the rate of subdivision participation if this agreement and the washington agreement are finalized oklahoma and washington would become subject to the settlement agreement and 48 of 49 eligible states would then be subject to the settlement agreement 

in september 2021 we announced that the distributors had reached an agreement with the cherokee nation in connection with ongoing negotiations toward a broader agreement with native american tribes in january 2022 the distributors entered into a term sheet with the native american tribes 

the settlement agreement and separate state settlements have not resolved all opioid lawsuits and claims brought by states and political subdivisions as of august 9 2022 we are still defendants in approximately 475 lawsuits brought by counties municipalities and other political subdivisions however we expect this number to decline as additional cases are dismissed as a result of the settlement agreement 

in total we have recorded total pretax charges of  117 billion and  563 billion in litigation chargesrecoveries net in the years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively in total we have  636 billion accrued at june 30 2022 of which  532 million is included in other accrued liabilities and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual whether as a result of settlement discussions a judicial decision or verdict or otherwise but we are not able to estimate a range of reasonably possible additional losses for these matters we continue to strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits and none of these agreements is an admission of liability or wrongdoing 

department of justice investigations 

we have received federal grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with investigations being conducted by the us attorneys office for the eastern district of new york and the fraud section of the us department of justice doj we have also received civil requests for information from other doj offices we believe that these investigations concern operation of our antidiversion program our antidiversion policies and procedures and distribution of certain controlled substances we are cooperating 

with these investigations we are unable to predict the outcome of any of these investigations 

private plaintiffs 

the settlement agreement does not address claims by private parties which includes unions and other health and welfare funds hospital systems and other healthcare providers businesses and individuals alleging personal injury private parties had brought approximately 440 lawsuits as of august 9 2022 of these 151 are purported class actions the causes of action asserted by these plaintiffs are similar to those asserted by public plaintiffs 

a trial in a case involving 21 plaintiffs began in state court in georgia in july 2022 a mistrial was declared shortly thereafter due to rising covid19 cases and a new trial date has not been set we are vigorously defending ourselves in all of these matters however trials are inherently unpredictable and it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these matters individually or in the aggregate could have a negative impact on our financial results 

insurance litigation 

we are involved in ongoing legal proceedings with two insurers related to the availability of insurance coverage for the lawsuits described above in october 2020 we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh pa “national union” seeking a declaration that national union is obligated to reimburse us for defense costs incurred in connection with the lawsuits described above in january 2021 swiss re international se commenced an arbitration in london seeking a determination that it does not have an obligation to reimburse us for defense and indemnity expenses incurred in connection with the lawsuits described above we have not recorded a receivable for any recoveries related to these insurance litigation matters as of june 30 2022 

cordis ivc filter matters 

product liability lawsuits 

as of august 9 2022 we are named as a defendant in 470 product liability lawsuits coordinated in alameda county superior court in california involving claims by approximately 5967 plaintiffs that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease ivc filter products another 18 lawsuits involving similar claims by approximately 20 plaintiffs are pending in other jurisdictions these lawsuits seek a variety of remedies including unspecified monetary damages in july 2021 we entered into an agreement to settle approximately 1300 claims we continue to vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits and are engaged in ongoing resolution discussions with plaintiffs 

at june 30 2022 we had a total of  512 million net of estimated insurance recoveries accrued for losses and legal defense costs related to the ivc filter lawsuits in the consolidated balance sheets we believe there is a range of estimated losses with respect to these matters because no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range we have accrued the minimum amount in the range we estimate the high end of the range to be approximately  105 billion net of estimated

in august 2021 the attorney general for the state of new mexico filed an action against certain ivc filter manufacturers including us alleging claims under new mexicos unfair practices act medicaid fraud act and fraud against taxpayers act the allegations made are similar to those made in the product liability lawsuits described above we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 

shareholder securities litigation 

in august 2019 the louisiana sheriffs pension  relief fund filed a purported class action complaint against cardinal health and certain current and former officers and employees in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our common shares between march 2015 and may 2018 in june 2020 the court appointed 1199 seiu health care employees pension fund as lead plaintiff and a consolidated amended complaint was filed in september 2020 the amended complaint alleges that the defendants violated sections 10b and 20a of the securities and exchange act of 1934 by making misrepresentations and omissions related to the acquisition integration of the cordis business and inventory and supply chain problems within the cordis business and seeks to recover unspecified damages and equitable relief for the alleged misstatements and omissions the complaint also alleges that one of the individual defendants violated section 20a of the exchange act because he sold shares of cardinal health stock during the time period in september 2021 the court denied our motion to dismiss we are vigorously defending ourselves against these claims 

specialty solutions doj investigation 

in november 2018 the united states attorney’s office for the district of massachusetts the usao commenced an investigation of cardinal health regarding possible violations of the us healthcare fraud and abuse laws in january 2022 without admitting liability we settled this matter with the doj for approximately  13 million which was recorded as expense within litigation chargesrecoveries net in our consolidated statements of earningsloss during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 

other civil litigation 

generic pharmaceutical pricing antitrust litigation 

in december 2019 pharmaceutical distributors including us were added as defendants in a civil class action lawsuit filed by indirect purchasers of generic drugs such as hospitals and retail pharmacies the indirect purchaser case is part of a multidistrict litigation consisting of multiple individual class action matters consolidated in the eastern district of pennsylvania the indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege that pharmaceutical distributors encouraged manufacturers to increase prices provided anticompetitive pricing information to manufacturers and improperly engaged in customer allocation the court granted our motion to dismiss and the indirect purchasers filed an amended complaint we intend to vigorously defend ourselves

many participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain including active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturers finished dose manufacturers repackagers distributors and retailers have been named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of recalls of certain medications due to alleged impurities in the active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished product 

in february 2019 a multidistrict litigation was created in the us district court for the district of new jersey the “sartan mdl” alleging api impurities in certain generic blood pressure medications we have been named as a defendant in the sartan mdl we are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter

tax effects of goodwill impairment charges 

during fiscal 2022 we recognized cumulative pretax charges of  21 billion for goodwill impairments related to the medical unit the net tax benefit related to these charges was  150 million 

tax effects of selfinsurance pretax loss 

during fiscal 2021 our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and applied to adjust our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act enacted by the united states congress in march 2020 

accordingly our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2021 included a  424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily to reflect the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate during the fiscal years from 2015 to 2018 35 percent for fiscal 2015 2016 and 2017 and 28 percent for fiscal 2018 and the current federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent 

in fiscal 2021 we filed for a refund of  974 million and in april 2022 we received a payment for  966 million which was net of certain adjustments see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail we also increased our noncurrent deferred tax liability by approximately  700 million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter 

we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of tax law however it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge these tax benefits the actual amount of the tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates 

tax effects of opioid litigation charges 

in connection with the  117 billion and  563 billion pretax charges for the opioid litigation recorded during fiscal 2021 and 2020 the net tax benefits were approximately  228 million and  488 million respectively our tax benefits are estimates which reflect our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation and are net of unrecognized tax benefits of  219 million and  469 million respectively 

we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act however these estimates require significant judgment since the us tax law governing deductibility was changed by the tax act further it is possible congress or the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits the actual amount of the tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates

the income tax benefit rate was  212  and  897  in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 compared to an income tax benefit rate of 21  in fiscal 2020 fluctuations in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the impact of goodwill impairment in fiscal 2022 impact of opioid litigation in fiscal 2021 and 2020 as well as the

impact of the carryback claim filed in accordance with the cares act provision in fiscal year 2021 

our effective tax rate has benefits from negotiated lower than statutory tax rates in select foreign jurisdictions which individually are not material to our effective tax rate but in aggregate have a favorable tax impact of approximately  21 million during fiscal 2022 

as of june 30 2022 foreign earnings of approximately  833 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs the computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable for amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2022 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

the following table presents the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at june 30 

in millions 2022 2021 deferred income tax assets receivable basis difference  41    40   accrued liabilities 675   874   sharebased compensation 34   38   loss and tax credit carryforwards 778   805   deferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions 33   35   other 23   16   total deferred income tax assets 1584   1808   valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  468   515  net deferred income tax assets  1116    1293   deferred income tax liabilities inventory basis differences   1164    1119  propertyrelated  288   375  goodwill and other intangibles  683   733  selfinsurance  975   975  other —    23  total deferred income tax liabilities   3110    3225  net deferred income tax liability

1 included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

2 included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

at june 30 2022 we had gross federal state and international loss and credit carryforwards of  275 million  35 billion and  22 billion respectively the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred tax asset of  778 million substantially all of these carryforwards are available for at least three years approximately  449 million of the valuation allowance at june 30 2022 applies to certain federal state and international loss carryforwards that in our opinion are more likely than not to expire unutilized however to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future the reduction in the valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense 

unrecognized tax benefits 

we had  943 million  932 million and  998 million of unrecognized tax benefits at june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 balances include  858 million  849 million and  753 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would have an impact on the effective tax rate the remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility recognition of these tax benefits would not affect our effective tax rate we include the full amount of unrecognized tax benefits in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits 

in millions 2022 2021 2020 balance at beginning of fiscal year  932    998    456   additions for tax positions of the current year 7   121   500   additions for tax positions of prior years 39   223   78   reductions for tax positions of prior years  19   138   27  settlements with tax authorities  12   271   6  expiration of the statute of limitations  4   1   3  balance at end of fiscal year 

 943    932    998   

it is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months due to activities of the us internal revenue service irs or other taxing authorities possible settlement of audit issues reassessment of existing unrecognized tax benefits or the expiration of statutes of limitations we estimate that the range of the possible change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is between zero and a net decrease of up to  75 million exclusive of penalties and interest 

we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes at june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 we had  48 million  49 million and  146 million respectively accrued for the payment of interest and penalties these balances are gross amounts before any tax

benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as a result of our irs audit settlements and carryback claim an immaterial amount of interest was recorded in fiscal 2022 and 2021 during fiscal 2020 we recognized  16 million of expense for interest and penalties in income tax expense respectively 

other tax matters 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state and local jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year 

expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly based on available information this information may support either an increase or a decrease in the required valuation allowance after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above we operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation 

we are a party to a tax matters agreement with carefusion corporation carefusion a subsidiary of becton dickinson and company under the tax matters agreement carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to our fiscal 2010 spinoff of carefusion the indemnification receivable was  75 million and  72 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets

during fiscal 2020 we entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of  200 million to hedge probable but not firmly committed future transactions associated with our debt during fiscal 2021 we terminated these swaps and reclassified an immaterial deferred gain from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense net in our consolidated statements of earningsloss because the forecasted transactions were probable of not occurring 

all gains and losses currently included within accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedges that are expected to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months are immaterial

risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks we do not currently consider material to our operations or of which we are not presently aware 

covid19 risks 

we have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

see the description of the actual and possible effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting disruptions on our business and operations discussed above in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in addition to the adverse impacts and uncertainties from the covid19 pandemic identified there we continue to face additional possible adverse impacts including those described below 

during the covid19 pandemic our medical segment experienced dramatically increased demand for and industry shortages of certain ppe such as masks gowns and gloves this increased demand resulted in increased costs to manufacture and source these products and ultimately higher inventory levels as a result we have sought additional sources for these products and to mitigate the cost increases we have raised our selling prices for affected products during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 selling prices and customer demand for certain ppe declined which we expect to continue into fiscal year 2022 this has resulted in inventory reserves our estimates for demand and selling prices are inherently uncertain and if demand or selling prices or other market dynamics decline in the future beyond our current assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required which would adversely impact medical segment profit 

additionally pricing actions have mitigated the impact of the increased costs to manufacture and source ppe as a result of the decreased demand and selling price we may not be successful at continuing to mitigate the impact of these increased costs in the future 

within our pharmaceutical segment covid19related volume declines have negatively impacted our pharmaceutical segment generics program but are expected to moderate in fiscal year 2022 if demand for these products does not return to precovid19 levels or returns more slowly than anticipated the negative impact could be more prolonged or significant than we currently expect 

federal state and local government policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 also resulted in the cancellation or deferral of many elective medical procedures and some of our customers closing or severely curtailing their operations while lower demand for surgical products resulting from reduced elective procedures had an adverse impact on medical segment profit during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 demand improved during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 if 

governmental policies designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 return and demand for these procedures does not increase or decreases further we could have less sales of the affected products and services than we currently expect additionally sustained changes in the manner in which patients access healthcare may result in shifts in consumer preferences that may not be favorable to us 

we cannot estimate the continued length or severity of the covid19 pandemic or the related consequences on the us and global economy and our business and operations including whether and when normal economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which further disruption may impact our business financial position results of operations or cash flow the covid19 pandemic has also heightened other risks including risks associated with competitive pressures supplier relationships international operations regulatory and licensing changes to the us healthcare environment cyber security and access to capital markets 

legal regulatory  compliance risks 

the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business  

our pharmaceutical segment distributes prescription opioid pain medications in recent years the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication has become a public health crisis 

a significant number of states counties municipalities and other public plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmaceutical wholesale distributors including us retail chains and others relating to the manufacturing marketing or distribution of prescription opioid pain medications in july 2021 we announced that as a result of the previously disclosed settlement framework we and two other national distributors have negotiated a proposed settlement agreement and settlement process that if all conditions are satisfied including the approval of the board of directors would result in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities the “proposed settlement agreement” this proposed settlement agreement is subject to contingencies and there is no assurance that a sufficient number of states and subdivisions will agree to the proposed settlement agreement or that the required contingencies will be satisfied it is possible that we may fail to reach a final settlement for more information on the proposed settlement and other opioidrelated litigation matters see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

a trial in the case brought by the ohio attorney general is scheduled to begin in september 2021 and a trial in the case brought by the washington attorney general is scheduled to begin in november 2021 the ohio attorney general has issued a press released indicating support for the proposed settlement agreement however the washington attorney general has issued 





a press release stating that washington will not agree to the proposed settlement agreement these public announcements are not binding and there is no assurance that any state that has made a public announcement of support for the proposed settlement agreement will ultimately execute the proposed settlement agreement it is also possible that even if the proposed settlement agreement becomes effective we could have trials for lawsuits brought by other states or subdivisions as well west virginia subdivisions and native american tribes are not a part of this settlement process and we are involved in separate negotiations with these groups 

in addition to the claims addressed by the proposed settlement agreement we are also being sued by private plaintiffs such as unions other health and welfare funds hospital systems other healthcare providers and individuals alleging personal injury for the same activities and could be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits 

we have received federal grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with investigations being conducted by the us attorneys office for the eastern district of new york and the fraud section of the us department of justice doj we have also received civil requests for information from other doj offices we believe that these investigations concern operation of our antidiversion program our antidiversion policies and procedures and distribution of certain controlled substances 

the defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits and investigations are subject to uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity or our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares beyond the amounts accrued in addition they could have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business 

other legislative regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and the distribution of these medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example several states have now adopted or proposed taxes or other fees on the sale of opioids these laws and proposals vary in the tax amounts imposed and the means of calculation liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted 

ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits investigations regulations and legislative actions and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations 

our business is subject to other rigorous quality regulatory and licensing requirements 

as described in greater detail in the business section products that we manufacture source distribute or market must comply with quality and regulatory requirements noncompliance or 

concerns over noncompliance including noncompliance by thirdparty contract manufacturers may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import manufacture or source products as well as product bans recalls safety alerts or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions which in turn could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device or other product and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

also as described in greater detail in the business section our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits product registrations licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies for example as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances we must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa failure to maintain or renew necessary permits product registrations licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information regulations currently in place continue to evolve and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect handle and maintain personal or patient information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations violations of federal state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties breach of contract claims costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations from time to time regulatory authorities investigate our policies or practices and may challenge them we are periodically subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs or other remedial measures for example the united states attorney’s office for the district of massachusetts and the department of health and human services officer of inspector general have been conducting an investigation related to discounts and rebates offered or provided to certain specialty 





solutions customers as a result of qui tam actions for more information on this investigation see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs such as state medicaid programs and the federal 340b drug pricing program in addition some businesses manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

industry participants including us rely on ethylene oxide “eto” to sterilize certain medical products that we manufacture or distribute regulatory actions have been taken by certain environmental regulatory authorities to reduce eto emissions during the sterilization and distribution process if such measures become more widespread we could experience increased costs to comply with reduced emissions standards and it is possible that we and other industry participants may be unable to effectively sterilize medical products possibly resulting in industrywide supply shortages or a reduction in surgical or medical procedures such increased costs or industrywide reductions in surgical and medical procedures would have a negative impact on our medical segment profit it is also possible that these regulatory actions could adversely impact our ability to procure products to distribute resulting in increased costs or industry supply disruptions 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

our global operations including transition services in connection with divestitures are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply or are alleged to fail to comply with any of these laws we could be subject to investigations or suffer civil or criminal sanctions for example in february 2020 we paid approximately 84 million to the securities and exchange commission to settle charges that our internal controls were not sufficient to detect improper payments made by employees of our former china distribution business 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or 

challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 

from time to time proposals are made in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate or tax payments specific 

initiatives that may impact us include possible increases in us or foreign corporate income tax rates or other changes in tax law to raise revenue the repeal of the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes the establishment or increase in taxation at the us state level on the basis of gross revenues recommendations of the recently completed base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission’s investigation into illegal state aid 

additionally in connection with the 563 billion pretax charge for the opioid litigation taken in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 and the additional 117 billion pretax charge recorded in fiscal year 2021 we recorded net tax benefits of 488 million and 228 million respectively reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the tax act however these estimates require significant judgment 

the us tax law governing deductibility was changed by the tax act and the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits or tax law could change again the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these matters 

in fiscal year 2021 our provision for income taxes reflects a 424 million benefit from the tax benefits of a net operating loss carryback under the cares act also as a result of this net operating loss carryback we have filed for a us federal income tax refund of 974 million in connection with this net operating loss carryback certain industry participants including us received a letter from the us house of representatives’ committee on oversight and reform questioning among other things our plans to take tax deductions for opioidrelated losses including our use of the net operating loss carryback provisions under the cares act and deductibility under the tax act we have responded to the letter additionally legislation has been proposed that would retroactively repeal the net operating loss carryback provision of the cares act if these initiatives are successful our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions for the periods from 2011 to 2014 during fiscal year 2021 we resolved all open matters with the irs for fiscal years 2008 to 2014 which also impacted reserves for later years this resolution has resulted in an adjustment to our provision for income taxes proposed adjustments in future audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 





changes to the us healthcare environment may not be favorable to us 

over a number of years the us healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and patient outcomes contain costs and increase efficiencies these changes include a general decline in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers the basis for payments beginning to transition from a feeforservice model to valuebased payments and risksharing models and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics physician offices and patients’ homes 

we expect the us healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future possible changes include further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits these possible changes and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes may adversely affect us 

legal proceedings could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our business which includes the distribution of controlled substances and other pharmaceutical products and the sourcing marketing and manufacturing of medical products we regularly become involved in disputes litigation and regulatory matters litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

for example we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described above in the risk factor titled the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business and in note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims for example we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava ivc filter products and in lawsuits alleging impurities in the active pharmaceutical ingredients in certain pharmaceutical products in addition product liability insurance for these types of claims is becoming more limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain it is possible that a settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim may not be covered by insurance or exceed available insurance recoveries if this happens and if any such settlement or judgment is in excess 

of any prior accruals our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

business  operational risks 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems business processes critical facilities and distribution networks 

we rely on our and thirdparty service providers information systems for a wide variety of critical operations including to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

• facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 

• receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

• manage accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers 

• process payments to suppliers 

• facilitate manufacturing and assembly of medical products and 

• generate financial information 

our business also depends on the proper functioning of our and our suppliers business processes critical facilities including our national logistics center and our distribution networks our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service providers business processes information systems critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted including disruption of access are damaged or fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic as they have been by the covid19 pandemic as discussed above or power outage or due to cybersecurity incidents ransomware or other actions of third parties including labor strikes or shortages political unrest and terrorist attacks manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action production quality deviations safety issues or raw material shortages or defects or because a key product or component is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities 

from time to time our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes such as receiving and processing customer orders customer service and accounts payable for example our pharmaceutical segment is currently engaged in a multiyear project to implement a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems and we recently transitioned certain finance processes to a thirdparty service provider if any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting 





our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a cyberattack or other systems breach 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive protected information relating to our customers company workforce and individuals with whom we and our customers conduct business we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to information security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition hardware software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security 

unauthorized parties have gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to our or a service providers systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deception we have been the target of cyber attacks including in prior fiscal years incidents where certain customer account information was accessed although we do not believe these incidents had a material impact on us similar incidents or events in the future may negatively impact our business reputation or financial results 

any compromise of our or a service providers information systems including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements including the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and those related to patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information as further described in the risk factor titled “our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements” above 

in addition insurance for losses arising from cyberattacks or other breaches is becoming more costly and limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain it is possible that we could incur losses that may not be covered by insurance or that would exceed available insurance recoveries if this happens our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our sales and credit concentration is significant 

cvs is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue cvs accounted for 26 percent of our fiscal 2021 revenue and 24 percent of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2021 if cvs terminates the agreements due to an alleged default by us defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases from us our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for 

that business for example we recently completed the divestiture of our cordis business and in the past few years we have also divested our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in china and our ownership interest in navihealth inc when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we could also incur higher costs or charges than planned or incur unexpected charges and could experience greater dissynergies than expected which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our ability to manage and complete acquisitions could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses completion of acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses involve a number of risks including the following we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management’s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties or delays establishing integrating or combining operations and systems including manufacturing facilities we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

our goodwill may be impaired which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us gaap requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist for our annual impairment test in fiscal 2021 the fair value of the medical unit which includes the cordis disposal group exceeded its carrying value by approximately three percent this testing involves estimates and significant judgments by management additional adverse changes in key assumptions including current assumptions about the impact of the cordis divestiture and the covid19 pandemic including estimated demand and selling prices for ppe an increase in the discount rate a decrease in the terminal growth rate or increases in tax rates among other things could result in a goodwill impairment in our medical unit for example if we were to increase the discount rate by a hypothetical 05 percent the carrying value of our medical unit would have exceeded the fair value by approximately one percent in fiscal 2021 

it is also possible that we may record significant charges related to other reporting units any charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates in mda above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing 





industry  economic risks 

we could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic in addition competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical segments may be increased by covid19 new business models new entrants new regulations changes in consumer demand or general competitive dynamics our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors which adversely affects our margins if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s profit margin could be adversely affected by changes in industry or market dynamics that we are not able to accurately predict 

in fiscal year 2021 our pharmaceutical segment’s generics program was negatively impacted by volume declines as has been the case for several years the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer purchase volumes pricing changes customer contract renewals generic pharmaceutical launches and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain as does their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings these factors have contributed to declines in some prior years and have more than offset the benefits from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs if performance of our generic pharmaceutical program declines in future fiscal years and we are unable to offset the decline our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will be adversely affected 

with respect to branded pharmaceutical products compensation under our contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost 

also almost all of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them however under certain agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as a part of our compensation in recent years manufacturers have increased prices less than in prior years if manufacturers in the aggregate change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost decide to reduce prices not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our margins could be adversely affected 

we depend on direct and indirect suppliers to make their products and raw materials available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs availability and regulatory risks associated with these products and raw materials 

we depend on others to manufacture some products that we market and distribute our operations are also dependent on various components compounds raw materials and energy supplied by others we purchase many of these components raw materials and energy and source certain products from numerous suppliers in various countries in some instances for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier our supplier relationships could be interrupted become less favorable to us or be terminated and the supply of these components compounds raw materials or products could be interrupted or become insufficient these supply interruptions or other disruptions in manufacturing processes could be caused by events beyond our control including natural disasters supplier facility shutdowns defective raw materials the impact of epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and actions by us or international governments including export restrictions or tariffs 

in addition due to the stringent regulatory requirements regarding the manufacture and sourcing of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components materials or products a sustained supply reduction or interruption and an inability to develop alternative and additional sources for such supply could result in lost sales increased cost damage to our reputation and may have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins pulp cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 we have experienced higher supply chain costs primarily related to the sourcing of certain components compounds raw materials and commodities due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 

consolidation in the us healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations 

in recent years us healthcare industry participants including distributors manufacturers suppliers healthcare providers insurers and pharmacy chains have consolidated or formed strategic alliances consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents if this consolidation trend continues it could adversely affect our results of operations 





changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies and exposure to economic political and currency risks could disrupt our global operations or negatively impact our financial results 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including europe asia and latin america global developments can affect our business in many ways our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and competition additionally divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks related to trade protection laws tariffs excise or other border taxes on goods sourced from certain countries or on the importation or exportation of products or raw materials changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies or tariffs could impact our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers we may be required to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we need or to manufacture certain of our products this could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

in addition we conduct our business in us dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results which are reported in us dollars we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures 





properties 

in the united states at june 30 2021 the pharmaceutical segment operated one national logistics center a number of primary pharmaceutical and specialty distribution facilities as well as nuclear pharmacy and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities the medical segment operated medicalsurgical distribution assembly manufacturing and other operating facilities in the united states 

at june 30 2021 our medical segment also operated manufacturing facilities in canada costa rica the dominican republic germany ireland japan malaysia malta mexico and thailand 

our principal executive offices are headquartered in an owned building located at 7000 cardinal place in dublin ohio 

we consider our operating properties to be in satisfactory condition and adequate to meet our present needs however we regularly evaluate operating properties and may make further additions and improvements or consolidate locations as we seek opportunities to expand or enhance the efficiency of our business 












 



legal proceedings 

in addition to the proceedings described below the legal proceedings described in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements are incorporated in this legal proceedings section by reference

consolidated results 

fiscal 2021 overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2021 was 1625 billion a 6 percent increase from the prior year primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers 

gaap and nongaap operating earningsloss 



the sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments 

we had gaap operating earnings of 472 million and a gaap operating loss of 41 billion during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively which includes pretax charges of 117 billion and 563 billion respectively recognized for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications see further description of opioid lawsuits in the significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

gaap and nongaap operating earnings during fiscal 2021 were adversely impacted by covid19 which includes an inventory reserve recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain medical segment personal protective equipment primarily certain categories of gloves to net realizable value personal protective equipment ppe refers to protective clothing medical and nonmedical grade gloves face shields face masks and other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness see significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda for additional information volume declines in our pharmaceutical segment generics program which includes the impact of covid19 also had an adverse impact these factors were partially offset by the beneficial impact of enterprisewide costsavings measures including global manufacturing efficiencies in the medical segment and higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales mix 

gaap and nongaap diluted eps 



the sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments 

1 diluted earningsloss per share attributable to cardinal health inc diluted eps or diluted loss per share 

2 the reconciling items are presented within this table net of tax except for transitional tax benefit net see quantification of tax effect of each reconciling item in our gaap to nongaap reconciliations in the section titled explanation and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 





3 for fiscal 2020 gaap diluted loss per share attributable to cardinal health inc and the eps impact from the gaap to nongaap per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 293 million common shares which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effects resulting from our gaap net loss for the period fiscal 2020 nongaap diluted eps is calculated using a weighted average of 295 million common shares which includes potentially dilutive shares 

4 litigation recoveriescharges net includes a tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2021 related to a net operating loss carryback our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and adjusted our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act the total benefit from the net operating loss carryback was 424 million however for purposes of nongaap financial measures we allocated 389 million of the benefit to litigation recoveriescharges net which is excluded from nongaap measures based on the relative amount of the selfinsurance pretax loss related to opioid litigation claims versus separate tax adjustments the tax benefit allocated to the separate tax adjustments of 35 million is included in nongaap measures 

the charges we recognized in fiscal 2021 and 2020 for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications had a 321 and 1754 per share aftertax impact on gaap diluted eps respectively 

during fiscal 2021 gaap and nongaap diluted eps were positively impacted by 144 and 012 per share respectively due to a tax benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily related to a selfinsurance pretax loss as further described in significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

gaap diluted eps during fiscal 2020 was favorably impacted by a 168 per share gain from the sale of the remainder of our equity interest in navihealth described further in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 34 billion at june 30 2021 compared to 28 billion at june 30 2020 the increase in cash during fiscal 2021 was due to net cash provided by operating activities of 24 billion offset by cash deployed of 573 million for dividends 570 million for debt repayments 400 million for capital expenditures and 200 million for share repurchases 





significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends 

covid19 



the covid19 pandemic covid19 continues to affect the us and global economies and as previously disclosed the pandemic began to materially affect our businesses during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the length and severity of the pandemic and its impacts on our businesses and results of operations are uncertain 

covid19 had a negative impact on our consolidated operating earningsloss in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we estimate that the impact on fiscal 2021 operating earnings was approximately 200 million greater than on fiscal 2020 operating earnings and we estimate that the impact on fiscal 2020 operating earningsloss was approximately 100 million 

pharmaceutical segment profit has been negatively impacted by covid19 largely due to volume declines in our generics program and nuclear and precision health solutions while fiscal 2021 volumes within our generics program were lower than levels prior to covid19 the impact on pharmaceutical segment profit improved on a yearoveryear basis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 similarly in comparison to prior year the impact of covid19 on nuclear and precision health solutions was positive for pharmaceutical segment profit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

our medical segment experienced dramatically increased demand for certain personal protective equipment due to covid19 personal protective equipment ppe refers to protective clothing medical and nonmedical grade gloves face shields face masks and other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness the peak of this heightened demand was during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2021 this increased demand resulted in higher sales volume for certain products increased costs to manufacture and source these products and higher inventory levels to meet customer commitments as a result we sought out additional sources for these products and to mitigate the impact of these cost increases we have raised our selling prices for the affected products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 selling prices and customer demand for certain ppe decreased as compared to the peak and we expect this decline to continue into fiscal 2022 this resulted in inventory cost above net realizable value requiring an inventory reserve of 197 million primarily related to certain categories of gloves which adversely impacted medical segment profit our estimates for customer demand and selling prices are inherently uncertain and if customer demand or selling prices decline in the future beyond our current assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required that would adversely impact medical segment profit see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates section in this mda for additional information 

during fiscal 2021 covid19 benefited medical segment profit in some ways as well higher volumes in our laboratory business and cost savings positively impacted medical segment profit additionally despite declining customer demand and selling prices in some categories of ppe as described above medical segment profit was benefited by pricing actions intended to mitigate the impact of cost increases in certain other ppe categories in addition while lower demand for surgical products resulting from reduced elective procedures had an adverse impact on medical segment profit during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 demand improved during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and was a positive contributor to yearoveryear segment profit 

we currently anticipate that the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on operating earnings will be less in fiscal 2022 than it was in fiscal 2021 which includes the inventory reserve of 197 million described above as a result in comparison to prior year we expect the covid19 impact for fiscal 2022 will be positive however we cannot estimate the length or severity of the covid19 pandemic or of the related us or global economic consequences on our businesses and results of operations including whether and when historic economic and operating conditions will resume or its impact on our business financial position results of operations or cash flow its impact may be greater or less than we anticipate 

opioid lawsuits 



in july 2021 we announced that we and two other national distributors have negotiated a proposed settlement agreement the “proposed settlement agreement” and settlement process that if all conditions are satisfied including boards of directors approval would result in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities 

west virginia subdivisions and native american tribes are not a part of this settlement process and we have been involved in separate negotiations with these groups the settlement process does not contemplate participation by any nongovernmental or nonpolitical entities or individuals in connection with the negotiations of the proposed settlement agreement we and the two other national distributors entered into a settlement with the state of new york and its participating subdivisions if the proposed settlement agreement becomes effective new york and its participating subdivisions will become a part of it 





the proposed settlement agreement is subject to contingencies and will not become effective unless and until the boards of directors of the three distributors each make separate independent determinations that 1 following a signon period a sufficient number of states have agreed to the proposed settlement agreement the “settling states” and subsequently 2 following a notice period that a sufficient number of states and political subdivisions including those that have not sued have agreed to the agreement or otherwise had their claims foreclosed to proceed to effectiveness prior to the second determination the settling states will also have an opportunity to make a determination as to whether a sufficient number of political subdivisions have agreed to the proposed settlement agreement or otherwise had their claims foreclosed to proceed with the proposed settlement agreement this process is currently contemplated to end in february 2022 although it may be extended by agreement it is possible that a sufficient number of states and subdivisions will not agree to the proposed settlement agreement or that other required contingencies will not be satisfied 

if these conditions are satisfied the proposed settlement agreement would become effective 60 days after the distributors determine that there is sufficient participation among political subdivisions during this 60day period the settling states and the distributors would cooperate to obtain consent judgments in each participating state embodying the terms of the settlement 

the proposed settlement agreement includes a cash component pursuant to which the company would pay up to 637 billion the majority of which would be paid over 18 years the exact payment amount will depend on several factors including the participation rate of states and political subdivisions the extent to which states take action to foreclose opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions eg laws barring opioid lawsuits by political subdivisions and the extent to which political subdivisions in settling states file additional opioid lawsuits against the company after the proposed settlement agreement becomes effective 

the proposed settlement agreement also includes injunctive relief terms relating to settling distributors’ controlled substance antidiversion programs including with respect to 1 governance 2 independence and training of the personnel operating our controlled substances monitoring program 3 due diligence for new and existing customers 4 ordering limits for certain products and 5 suspicious order monitoring a monitor will be selected to oversee compliance with these provisions for a period of five years in addition we and the two other national distributors will engage a thirdparty vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting distributors will fund the clearinghouse for ten years 

additionally a trial before a judge in west virginia in the cabell county and city of huntington cases concluded in july 2021 and the judge has not yet issued a decision in addition a trial in the case brought by the ohio attorney general is scheduled to begin in september 2021 and a trial in the case brought by the washington attorney general is scheduled to begin in november 2021 the ohio attorney general has issued a press release indicating support for the proposed settlement agreement however the washington attorney general has issued a press release stating that washington will not agree to the proposed settlement agreement 

in connection with the opioid lawsuits and settlement negotiations we have recorded total pretax charges of 117 billion and 563 billion in litigation chargesrecoveries net in the years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively in total we have 673 billion accrued at june 30 2021 of which 405 million is included in other accrued liabilities as we expect to make our first annual settlement payment into escrow on or before september 30 2021 and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

the net tax benefits associated with the opioid litigation charges are 228 million and 488 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively our tax benefits are estimates which reflect our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation and are net of unrecognized tax benefits of 219 million and 469 million respectively the fiscal 2021 net tax benefit and unrecognized tax benefits were primarily due to our assessment of the specific terms of the proposed settlement agreement our assumptions and estimates around this benefit and uncertain tax position require significant judgment and the actual amount of tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

tax effects of selfinsurance pretax loss 

during fiscal 2021 our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and applied to adjust our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the cares act enacted by the united states congress in march 2020 





accordingly our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2021 included a 424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily to reflect the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate during the fiscal years from 2015 to 2018 35 percent for fiscal 2015 2016 and 2017 and 28 percent for fiscal 2018 and the current federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent 

we have filed for a us federal income tax refund of 974 million as a result of the net operating loss carryback under the cares act which we expect to receive within 12 months and accordingly have recorded a current asset on our consolidated balance sheet at june 30 2021 we also increased our noncurrent deferred tax liability by approximately 700 million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter 

we have recorded these amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of tax law however it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge these tax benefits or that the tax law could change the actual amount or timing of the tax benefit may differ from these expectations see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

cordis divestiture 

on march 12 2021 we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to sell our cordis business to hellman  friedman for proceeds of 927 million in cash subject to customary purchase price adjustments and we retained certain working capital accounts and product liability for lawsuits and claims related to inferior vena cava ivc filters in the us and canada as described in note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” the transaction closed on august 2 2021 and we received proceeds of 927 million net of cash transferred in connection with the closing we entered into a transition services agreement tsa with the buyer to provide support functions for a period of up to twentyfour months following the sale see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2021 we recognized a 60 million pretax writedown of the net assets held for sale in impairment and gainloss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statement of earningsloss we recorded a net tax expense of 9 million associated with the impact of the writedown and the required tax adjustments related to held for sale accounting 

in connection with the divestiture during fiscal 2021 we recognized costs of 28 million associated with exit or disposal activities we expect to record up to 100 million of additional costs associated with these activities primarily during fiscal 2022 these costs are recorded in restructuring and employee severance in our consolidated statements of earningsloss we expect these charges to consist of approximately 83 million of professional project management and other service fees to support the divestiture 19 million of employeerelated costs and additional expenses from facility exits and other restructuring activities 

we expect the divestiture of the cordis business will decrease annual medical segment revenue by approximately 800 million and adversely impact medical segment profit by approximately 80 million the divestiture of our cordis business is subject to risks and uncertainties that may further adversely impact medical segment profit for example the tsa period may be extended beyond our current expectations or could have unintended consequences and the costs associated with the exit or disposal activities and stranded costs could be greater than anticipated 

pharmaceutical segment 

the performance of our pharmaceutical segment generics program adversely impacted the yearoveryear comparison of pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2021 due to volume declines in our generics program including the impact of covid19 the pharmaceutical segment generics program includes among other things the impact of generic pharmaceutical product launches customer volumes pricing changes and the red oak sourcing llc venture red oak sourcing with cvs health corporation cvs health in august 2021 we amended our agreement with cvs health to extend the term of the red oak sourcing agreement through june 2029 the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer volumes pricing changes customer contract renewals and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain as does their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2022 

medical segment 



in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 our medical segment experienced increased supply chain costs primarily related to transportation labor and commodities while we are taking actions to mitigate the impact of these and other sourcing cost increases primarily through costsavings measures including global manufacturing efficiencies we expect these increased costs to adversely impact medical segment profit in fiscal 2022 





information technology investments 



our pharmaceutical segment is in a multiyear project to implement a replacement of certain finance and operating systems within the medical segment cardinal health athome solutions is also investing in a system transformation we expect that these investments will result in increased projectrelated expenses and depreciation related to capital expenditures which will negatively impact operating earnings and segment profit in fiscal 2022 and beyond 





results of operations 

revenue 





fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2021 pharmaceutical segment revenue grew by 83 billion primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers which together increased revenue by 81 billion 

medical segment 

fiscal 2021 medical segment revenue increased primarily within products and distribution which increased revenue by 11 billion primarily due to a net benefit from covid19 including the positive impact of ppe and higher volumes in our laboratory business 

cost of products sold 



cost of products sold for fiscal 2021 increased 96 billion 7 percent due to the factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin 





gross margin 



  



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



fiscal 2021 consolidated gross margin decreased primarily due to the adverse impact of covid19 which includes an inventory reserve recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain medical segment ppe primarily certain categories of gloves to net realizable value partially offset by higher volumes in our laboratory business for additional information regarding inventory reserves see significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda volume declines in our pharmaceutical segment generics program which includes the impact of covid19 also had an adverse impact these factors were partially offset by higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales mix and the beneficial comparison of the current year insurance recoveries with the prioryear charge in connection with a voluntary recall for certain surgical gowns and a voluntary recall and field actions for surgical procedure packs containing affected gowns together the recalls 

gross margin rate declined during fiscal 2021 mainly due to changes in pharmaceutical distribution product sales mix and an inventory reserve recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain medical segment ppe to net realizable value while branded pharmaceutical sales contributed positively to gross margin dollars during fiscal 2021 they had a dilutive impact on our overall gross margin rate 





distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



fiscal 2021 sga expenses decreased primarily due to the beneficial impact of enterprisewide costsavings measures the yearoveryear comparison was also favorably impacted by the 37 million charge in connection with the recalls recognized during fiscal 2020 these factors were partially offset by information technology investments and the 41 million assessment on prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in new york state in calendar years 2017 and 2018 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new york opioid stewardship act 





segment profit 



we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit among other measures see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2021 pharmaceutical segment profit was adversely impacted due to volume declines in our generics program including the impact of covid19 partially offset by higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales mix 

pharmaceutical segment financial results do not include the 117 billion and 563 billion charges associated with the opioid litigation during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively see significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition pharmaceutical segment financial results do not include the 41 million assessment on prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in new york state in calendar years 2017 and 2018 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new york opioid stewardship act 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2021 medical segment profit decreased largely due to the adverse impact of covid19 which primarily includes an inventory reserve recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain ppe primarily certain categories of gloves to net realizable value partially offset by higher volumes in our laboratory business in addition enterprisewide costsavings measures including global manufacturing efficiencies had a positive impact on medical segment profit 

corporate 

the changes in corporate during fiscal 2021 are due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earningsloss section that follows 





other components of consolidated operating earningsloss 



in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed previously consolidated operating earningsloss were impacted by the following 



restructuring and employee severance 

in fiscal 2021 restructuring costs were primarily related to the implementation of certain enterprisewide costsavings measures and the divestiture of our cordis business in fiscal 2020 restructuring costs were primarily related to the implementation of certain enterprisewide costsavings measures 

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 428 million and 512 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively 

impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets net 

during fiscal 2021 we recognized a 60 million pretax writedown of the assets held for sale from the divestiture of our cordis business see the significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recognized pretax charges of 117 billion and 563 billion respectively associated with certain opioid matters see significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recognized 56 million and 103 million respectively of estimated losses and legal defense costs associated with the ivc filter product liability claims 

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recognized income of 112 million and 16 million respectively for recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member 

other components of earningsloss before income taxes 



in addition to the items discussed above earningsloss before income taxes was impacted by the following 



other incomeexpense net 

during fiscal 2021 other incomeexpense net was favorable compared to the prioryear period primarily due to an increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments which offsets fluctuations included within sga expenses and is discussed further in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements gains on investments in nonmarketable equity securities and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

interest expense net 

fiscal 2021 interest expense decreased from fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower debt outstanding and lower shortterm interest rates 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recognized losses of 14 million and 16 million respectively in connection with the redemption and early debt repurchases as described further in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

gainloss on sale of equity interest in navihealth 

during fiscal 2020 we recognized a pretax gain of 579 million from the sale of our equity interest in a partnership that owned navihealth as described further in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 





provision for income taxes 



fluctuations in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the impact of opioid litigation in fiscal 2021 and 2020 as well as the impact of the carryback claim filed in accordance with the cares act provision in fiscal year 2021 

a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 



1 the table represents the following fiscal 2021 is pretax income with tax benefit and fiscal 2020 is pretax loss with tax benefit 

2 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 

3 includes the tax impact of global intangible lowtaxed income gilti tax the foreignderived intangible income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the us tax code 

fiscal 2021 



during fiscal 2021 and 2020 the effective tax rate was 897 percent and 21 percent respectively included in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was a 424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily related to a selfinsurance pretax loss included in both 2021 and 2020 were net tax benefits related to the treatment of the tax impacts of the fiscal 2021 and 2020 opioid litigation charges  

tax effects of selfinsurance pretax loss 

during fiscal 2021 our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and applied to adjust our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the cares act enacted by the united states congress in march 2020 

accordingly our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2021 included a 424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily to reflect the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate during the fiscal years from 2015 to 2018 35 percent for fiscal 2015 2016 and 2017 and 28 percent for fiscal 2018 and the current federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent 

we have filed for a us federal income tax refund of 974 million as a result of the net operating loss carryback under the cares act which we expect to receive within 12 months and accordingly have recorded a current asset on our consolidated balance sheet at june 30 2021 we also increased our noncurrent deferred tax liability by approximately 700 million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter 

tax effect of opioid litigation charges 

the net tax benefits associated with the opioid litigation charges are 228 million and 488 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively our tax benefits are estimates which reflect our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation and are net of unrecognized tax benefits of 219 million and 469 million respectively the fiscal 2021 net tax benefit and unrecognized tax benefits were primarily due to our assessment of the specific terms of the proposed settlement agreement our assumptions and estimates around this benefit and uncertain tax position require significant judgment and the actual amount of tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates 





ongoing audits 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations during fiscal 2021 we resolved all open issues with respect to the company’s activity within fiscal years 2008 through 2014 with the us internal revenue service irs this resolution resulted in an adjustment to our provision for income taxes including an impact to reserves for later years new challenges related to future audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based on available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion contractual obligations tax payments current and projected debt service requirements early extinguishment of debt dividends and share repurchases and potential opioid litigation settlement payments associated with the proposed settlement agreement if we decide to engage in one or more acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 34 billion at june 30 2021 compared to 28 billion at june 30 2020 the increase in cash during fiscal 2021 was due to net cash provided by operating activities of 24 billion offset by cash deployed of 573 million for dividends 570 million for debt repayments 400 million for capital expenditures and 200 million for share repurchases at june 30 2021 our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

during fiscal 2020 our cash and equivalents increased due to 20 billion of net cash provided by operating activities which reflects increases to working capital associated with the timing of payments to vendors and 886 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of investments substantially all of which was related to the sale of our equity interest in navihealth offset by cash deployed of 14 billion for debt repayments 569 million for dividends and 350 million for share repurchases 

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases payments to vendors and tax payments in the regular course of business as well as 

fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2021 included 523 million of cash and equivalents held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 

in june 2021 we returned 127 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the us 

as of june 30 2021 foreign earnings of approximately 825 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs the computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable for amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our financial statements in fiscal 2021 

other financing arrangements and financial instruments 



credit facilities and commercial paper 

in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow other sources of liquidity at june 30 2021 include a 20 billion commercial paper program backed by a 20 billion revolving credit facility we also have a 10 billion committed receivables sales facility at june 30 2021 we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility during fiscal 2021 under our commercial paper program and our committed receivables program we had maximum combined total daily amounts outstanding of 200 million and an immaterial average combined daily amount outstanding 

our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facilities require us to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 375to1 as of june 30 2021 we were in compliance with this financial covenant 

longterm obligations 

at june 30 2021 we had total longterm obligations including the current portion and other shortterm borrowings of 62 billion 

in june 2021 we redeemed all outstanding 32 notes due june 2022 for 238 million and 262 million aggregate principle amount of 2616 notes due june 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest plus the makewhole premium applicable to the notes in connection with these redemptions we recorded a 13 million loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during fiscal 2021 we also early repurchased 40 million of the floating rate notes due 2022 and 2 million of the 2616 notes due 2022 with available cash in connection with the early debt repurchases we recorded a 1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt 

in june 2020 we redeemed 500 million aggregate principle amount of 4625 notes due december 2020 at a redemption 





price equal to 100 of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest plus the makewhole premium applicable to the notes in connection with the redemption we recorded a 7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during fiscal 2020 we also early repurchased 247 million of the 2616 notes due 2022 11 million of the 32 notes due 2022 20 million of the floating rate notes due 2022 104 million of the 341 notes due 2027 6 million of the 46 notes due 2043 5 million of the 49 notes due 2045 and 35 million of the 4368 notes due 2047 in connection with these early debt repurchases we recognized a 9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt 

the redemption and repurchases were paid for with available cash and other shortterm borrowings 

on august 13 2021 we announced our intention to early redeem all remaining outstanding 2616 notes due june 2022 on 

september 15 2021 at an expected redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest plus the makewhole premium applicable to the notes 

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as note 1 and note 10 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

anticipated capital resources 

tax effects of selfinsurance pretax loss 

in connection with a tax benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily related to a selfinsurance pretax loss as described further in significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have filed for a us federal income tax refund of 974 million which we expect to receive within 12 months accordingly we have recorded a current asset for this amount on our consolidated balance sheet at june 30 2021 we also increased our noncurrent deferred tax liability by approximately 700 million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter 

cordis divestiture

capital deployment 



opioid settlement framework 

we had 673 billion accrued at june 30 2021 related to certain opioid litigation including the proposed settlement agreement as further described within the significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we expect the majority of the payment amounts to be spread over 18 years we currently expect to make our first annual settlement payment under the proposed settlement agreement in the amount of 405 million into escrow on or before september 30 2021 if the proposed settlement agreement does not become effective this payment will be returned to us we expect to make subsequent annual payments beginning in july 2022 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 400 million and 375 million respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between 400 million and 450 million and to be primarily for information technology and infrastructure projects 





dividends 

during fiscal 2021 we paid quarterly dividends totaling 194 per share an increase of 1 percent from fiscal 2020 

on may 5 2021 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 04908 per share or 196 per share on an annualized basis which was paid on july 15 2021 to shareholders of record on july 1 2021 

on august 4 2021 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 04908 per share payable on october 15 2021 to shareholders of record on october 1 2021 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we repurchased 200 million and 350 million respectively of our common shares we funded the repurchases with available cash and shortterm borrowings see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information at june 30 2021 we had 743 million authorized for share repurchases remaining on a program that expires on december 31 2021 





contractual obligations 

at june 30 2021 our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period were as follows 



1 represents maturities of our longterm debt obligations and other shortterm borrowings excluding finance lease obligations described below see note 6 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information 

2 represents minimum finance lease obligations included within current portion of longterm obligations and other shortterm borrowings and longterm obligations less current portion in our consolidated balance sheets and further described in note 5 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

3 represents minimum operating lease obligations included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and further described in note 5 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

4 a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is legally enforceable and specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or 

variable price provisions and approximate timing of the transaction the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table in addition contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period purchase obligations and other payments also includes quarterly payments to cvs health corporation in connection with red oak sourcing which also reflects the august 2021 amendment to extend the term through june 2029 see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

5 longterm liabilities such as unrecognized tax benefits deferred taxes and other tax liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflows see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 

6 total contractual obligations do not include payments that may be made in connection with the opioid litigation as further described in significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in july 2021 we announced that we and two other national distributors have negotiated the proposed settlement agreement and settlement process that if all conditions are satisfied would result in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities the proposed settlement agreement is subject to certain contingencies and includes a cash component pursuant to which the company would pay up to approximately 637 billion the majority of which would be paid over 18 years we currently expect to make our first annual settlement payment of 405 million into escrow on or before september 30 2021 if the settlement agreement does not become effective this payment will be returned to us we expect subsequent annual payments to be made beginning in july 2022 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2021 as that term is defined in the sec rules 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

the covid19 pandemic continues to affect the us and global economies and as previously disclosed the pandemic began to materially affect our businesses during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the length and severity of the pandemic and its impacts on our businesses and results of operations are uncertain 

allowance for doubtful accounts 



the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging historical writeoff trends payment history industry trends customer financial strength customer credit ratings or bankruptcies we regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions including the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic may affect credit risks see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts 

a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2021 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 9 million we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2021 are appropriate 

at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue in addition the financial accounting standards board’s 

amended accounting guidance that requires entities to measure credit losses on trade and other receivables using an expected credit loss model that considers historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts was effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures the following table presents information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

inventories 



lifo inventory 

a portion of our inventories 50 percent and 56 percent at june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment “distribution facilities” the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earningsloss depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend historically prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise resulting in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for inventories 

using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost 





we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation at june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively inventories valued at lifo cost were 565 million and 411 million higher than the average cost value we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not writeup the value of our inventory from average cost to lifo cost at june 30 2021 or 2020 

fifo inventory 

our remaining inventory including inventory in our medical segment that is not valued at the lower of lifo cost or market is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout fifo method or net realizable value we reserve for the lower of cost or net realizable value using the estimated selling prices and estimated sales demand in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation due to the unprecedented demand for certain ppe as a result of covid19 our medical segment manufactured and sourced inventory at higher costs than in periods prior to 

covid19 as selling prices and customer demand have decreased compared to the peak of covid19 we recorded a reserve of 197 million primarily related to certain categories of gloves to reduce the carrying value of certain ppe to its net realizable value our estimates for selling prices and demand are inherently uncertain and if our assumptions decline in the future additional inventory reserves may be required for example a hypothetical 5 percent decline in the estimated selling prices would have decreased the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately 30 million as of june 30 2021 

excess and obsolete inventory 

we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific categories of inventory age and expiration dates of onhand inventory and manufacturer return policies inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 185 million and 155 million at june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount there is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for the annual goodwill impairment test in the current year the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions which are components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear and precision health solutions division nuclear and precision health solutions division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health 

athome solutions division “medical unit” and cardinal health athome solutions division 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and if necessary the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit 

our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches using discount rates ranging from 85 percent to 115 percent we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts under the marketbased guideline public company method we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets we also use the marketbased guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions changes in the industry or peer groups or changes in weightings assigned to the discounted cash flow method guideline public company method or guideline transaction method could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment if a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or 





operating cash flow or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

medical unit goodwill 

due to the planned divestiture of our cordis business we allocated 388 million of goodwill from the medical unit to the cordis disposal group based on the estimated relative fair values of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained 

for our annual impairment test in fiscal 2021 the fair value of the medical unit which includes the cordis disposal group exceeded its carrying value of 102 billion by approximately 3 percent for this test we used a discount rate of 85 percent and a terminal growth rate of 2 percent additionally we assigned a weighting of 80 percent to the discounted cash flow method 10 percent to the guideline public company method and 10 percent to the guideline transaction method the goodwill balance for the medical unit was 41 billion at june 30 2021 

additional adverse changes in key assumptions such as assumptions about the impact of the cordis divestiture and the covid19 pandemic including estimated demand and selling prices for ppe an increase in the discount rate a decrease in the terminal growth rate or increases in tax rates among other things could result in a goodwill impairment for the medical unit for example if we were to increase the discount rate by a hypothetical 03 percent or decrease the terminal growth rate by a hypothetical 1 percent the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value for the medical unit by approximately 1 percent for fiscal 2021 additionally the estimated tax rate used in goodwill impairment 

testing is a marketbased assumption which is impacted by the us federal statutory tax rate if the us federal statutory tax rate were to increase to 28 percent and no other inputs were changed the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value of the medical unit for any of our other reporting units the fair value would not have been less than the carrying amount for fiscal 2021 if we increased the discount rate by 1 percent or if the us federal statutory tax rate were to increase to 28 percent 

we also performed goodwill impairment testing during the three months ended march 31 2021 for the portion of the medical unit that would be retained the carrying value of the medical unit that would be retained was 93 billion of which 41 billion was goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to exceed its carrying value using a combination of the incomebased approach and the marketbased approach based on assumptions as of march 31 2021 there have been no known significant changes in the relative fair values for the medical unit that would be retained or the cordis disposal group 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if so then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the respective assets carrying amount our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 

see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

loss contingencies and selfinsurance 



we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

loss contingencies 

we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

examples of such contingencies include various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the cordis inferior vena cava cordis ivc filter lawsuits 

in connection with the opioid litigation as described further in the significant developments in fiscal 2021 and trends section in this mda we recorded pretax charges of 117 billion and 563 billion during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively in july 2021 we announced that we and two other national distributors have negotiated a proposed settlement agreement subject to certain conditions and contingencies there is no assurance that the contingencies to the proposed settlement agreement will be satisfied 





we develop and periodically update reserve estimates for the cordis ivc claims including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs to project future cordis ivc claim costs we use a methodology based largely on recent experience including claim filing rates estimated severity by claim type sales data implant and injury to report lag patterns and estimated defense costs 

selfinsurance 

we selfinsure through a whollyowned insurance subsidiary for employee healthcare certain product liability matters auto liability property and workers compensation and maintain insurance for losses exceeding certain limits 

selfinsurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs administrative fees claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information related to each claim if available other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period 

the amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits 

we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

provision for income taxes 



we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



1 total deferred income tax assets included 805 million and 589 million of loss and tax credit carryforwards at june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively 

2 the valuation allowance primarily relates to federal state and international loss and credit carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 

expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above we 

operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

tax effects of selfinsurance pretax loss 

during fiscal 2021 our whollyowned insurance subsidiary recorded a selfinsurance pretax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation this selfinsurance pretax loss which did not impact our pretax consolidated results was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes the net operating loss was carried back and applied to adjust our taxable income for fiscal 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the cares act enacted by the united states congress in march 2020 

accordingly our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2021 included a 424 million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily to reflect the difference between the federal 





statutory income tax rate during the fiscal years from 2015 to 2018 35 percent for fiscal 2015 2016 and 2017 and 28 percent for fiscal 2018 and the current federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent 

we have filed for a us federal income tax refund of 974 million as a result of the net operating loss carryback under the cares act which we expect to receive within 12 months and accordingly have recorded a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets at june 30 2021 we also increased our noncurrent deferred tax liability by approximately 700 million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter 

tax effects of opioid litigation charges 

in connection with the 117 billion and 563 billion pretax charges for the opioid litigation during fiscal year 2021 and 2020 respectively we recorded a tax benefit of 228 million and 488 million respectively our tax benefits are estimates which reflect our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation and are net of unrecognized tax benefits of 219 million and 469 million respectively the fiscal 2021 net tax benefit and unrecognized tax benefits were primarily due to our assessment of the specific terms of the proposed settlement agreement we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the tax act however these estimates require significant judgment since the us tax law governing deductibility was changed by the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act further it is possible that congress or the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits the actual amount of the tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates see note 8 of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations during fiscal 2021 we resolved all open issues with respect to the company’s activity within fiscal years 2008 through 2014 with the us internal revenue service irs this resolution resulted in an adjustment to our provision for income taxes including an impact to reserves for later years new challenges related to future audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued changes in our current estimates due to 

unanticipated market conditions tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets for a further discussion on provision for income taxes see note 8 of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the us tax code as per the tax act as enacted by the united states government on december 22 2017 we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the tax act which is subject to further interpretation by the irs see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 





explanation and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

this report including the fiscal 2021 overview section within mda contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap 

in addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate our performance engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and in some circumstances are more closely correlated to the performance of our underlying ongoing business we provide these nongaap financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a yearoveryear basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors however the nongaap financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated 

exclusions from nongaap financial measures 

management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the nongaap measures presented in this report for its own and for investors’ assessment of the business for the reasons identified below 

• lifo charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive lastin firstout lifo inventory charges or credits such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted the exclusion of lifo charges and credits from nongaap metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies’ financial results we did not recognize any lifo charges or credits during the periods presented 

• surgical gown recall costs or income includes inventory writeoffs and certain remediation and supply disruption costs net of related insurance recoveries arising from the january 2020 recall of select association for the advancement of medical instrumentation aami level 3 surgical gowns and voluntary field actions a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs for presource procedure packs containing affected gowns income from surgical gown recall costs represents insurance recoveries of these certain costs we have excluded these costs from our nongaap metrics to allow investors to better understand the underlying operating results of the business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies’ financial results 

• state opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years is the portion of state assessments for prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in periods prior to the period in which the expense is incurred this portion is excluded from nongaap financial measures because it is retrospectively applied to sales in prior fiscal years and inclusion would obscure analysis of the current fiscal year results of our underlying ongoing business additionally while states laws may require us to make payments on an ongoing basis the portion of the assessment related to sales in prior periods are contemplated to be onetime nonrecurring items income from state opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years represents reversals of accruals when the underlying assessments were invalidated by a court or reimbursed by manufacturers 

• restructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business 

• amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs  which include transaction costs integration costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies financial results additionally costs for amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets are noncash amounts which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical current and forecasted financial results we also exclude other acquisitionrelated costs which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity’s initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation these costs are also significantly impacted by the timing complexity and size of acquisitions 





• impairments and gain or loss on disposal of assets are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount and in the case of impairments are noncash amounts so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical current and forecasted financial results 

• litigation recoveries or charges net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount during fiscal 2021 we incurred a tax benefit related to a carryback of a net operating loss some pretax amounts which contributed to this loss relate to litigation charges as a result we allocated substantially all of the tax benefit to litigation charges 

• loss on early extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance additionally the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions 

• gainloss on sale of equity interest in navihealth was incurred in connection with the sale of our remaining equity interest in navihealth in fiscal 2020 the equity interest was retained in connection with the initial sale of our majority interest in navihealth during fiscal 2019 we exclude this significant gain because gains or losses on investments of this magnitude do not typically occur in the normal course of business and are similar in nature to a gain or loss from a divestiture of a majority interest which we exclude from nongaap results the gain on the initial sale of our majority interest in navihealth in fiscal 2019 was also excluded from our nongaap measures 

• transitional tax benefit net related to the tax cuts and jobs act is excluded because it results from the onetime impact of a very significant change in the us federal corporate tax rate and due to the significant size of the benefit obscures analysis of trends and financial performance the transitional tax benefit includes the initial estimate and subsequent adjustments for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings 

the tax effect for each of the items listed above other than the transitional tax benefit item is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdictions in which the item is recorded the gross tax and net impact of each item are presented with our gaap to nongaap reconciliations

margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts and rebates from manufacturers and may in limited instances include price appreciation our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time 

margin from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers is derived from compensation we receive for providing a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers our compensation typically is a percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost that is set by manufacturers in addition under a limited number of agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as part of our compensation

competition 



we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare products we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the manufacturing and distribution of medical devices and surgical products we compete on many levels including price service offerings support services breadth of product lines and product quality and efficacy 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies companies that provide specialty pharmaceutical services and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the 

 

pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers we also compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly 

in the medical segment we compete with many diversified healthcare companies and national medical product distributors such as medline industries inc owens  minor inc and becton dickinson and company as well as regional medical product distributors and companies that are focused on specific product categories we also compete with companies that distribute medical products to patients homes and thirdparty logistics companies 

employees 



at june 30 2020  we had approximately 30000 employees in the united states and approximately 18000 employees outside of the united states 

intellectual property 



we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents and continue to pursue patent protection throughout the world relating to the manufacture operation and use of various medical and surgical products to certain distribution and logistics systems to the production and distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and to other service offerings we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 

 

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 





regulatory matters 



our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon the specific business we may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements they can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products require us to initiate product recalls seize products or impose criminal civil and administrative sanctions 

distribution 

state boards of pharmacy fda dea and various other state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal prescription drug marketing act of 1987 drug quality and security act of 2013 the “dqsa” and controlled substances act the csa the csa governs the sale packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards including effective antidiversion programs and comply with the csa they must also comply with state requirements relating to controlled substances that differ from state to state 

manufacturing sourcing and marketing 

we sell our manufactured products in the united states canada europe asia latin america and other markets the fda and other governmental agencies in the united states as well as foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing including good manufacturing practices quality systems labeling promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the products cleared or approved uses distribution importation and postmarket surveillance for most of our manufactured products we are also responsible for compliance with 

 

these requirements when we source certain medical segment products from thirdparty manufacturers 

we need specific approval or clearance from and registrations with regulatory authorities before we can market and sell some products in the united states and certain other countries including countries in the european union eu 

in the united states authorization to commercially market a medical device is generally received in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval “pma” requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective many of our medical segment branded products are cleared through the 510k process and certain products must be approved through the pma process 

in the eu we are required to comply with the medical device directive mdd and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices in 2017 eu regulatory bodies finalized a new medical device regulation mdr which will replace the mdd when it is implemented in may 2021 under the mdr medical devices marketed in the eu will require significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements except that devices with valid ce mark issued before may 2020 can be marketed until may 2024 

it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals clearances and registrations of medical devices and they might not be granted on a timely basis if at all even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight including periodic inspection of manufacturing facilities by fda and other regulatory authorities both in the united states and internationally 

from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action which may include recalling the product correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers for example in january 2020 we issued a voluntary recall for 91 million aami level 3 surgical gowns and two voluntary field actions a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs for 29 million presource procedure packs containing affected gowns because one of our fdaregistered suppliers in china had shifted production of some gowns to unapproved sites with uncontrolled environments resulting in us being unable to assure the sterility of the gowns 





any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may limit our ability to effectively manufacture source market and sell our products limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations for additional information please see our risk factor entitled our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

privacy and data protection 

we are subject to various and evolving privacy laws and regulations in many jurisdictions because we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information we are subject to laws that require specified privacy and security measures and that regulate the use and disclosure of such information including the us health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act as well as state laws in the united states 

we also collect handle and maintain other sensitive personal and financial information within the us these activities are regulated by certain federal and state laws for example the new california consumer privacy act became effective in january 2020 and grants specified rights to consumers over the use of their personal information including increased transparency other states are considering adopting similar or different comprehensive privacy laws internationally we are also subject to privacy and data protection laws that require significant compliance efforts including the eus general data protection regulation gdpr canadas personal information protection and electronic documents act pipeda and japans act on the protection of personal information appi among many others 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 

our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities including for xofigo require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the nrc applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate including pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices in addition our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities also must comply with fda regulations including good manufacturing practices 

product tracing and supply chain integrity 

title ii of the dqsa known as the drug supply chain security act or track and trace establishes a phasedin national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to detect prevent and rapidly respond to the introduction of drugs that may be counterfeit diverted stolen adulterated subject of a fraudulent transaction or otherwise unfit for distribution the first phase of implementation began in 2015 and upon full implementation in 2023 we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug tracing system in addition the fda also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier these regulations are being phased in through 2020 the mdr described above also introduces a new unique device identifier requirement 

 

government healthcare programs 

we are subject to us federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws these laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order recommend or purchase products or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded healthcare programs they also prohibit submitting any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government there are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to medicaid and other statefunded healthcare programs violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare 

programs such as state medicaid programs and the federal 340b drug pricing program these businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations including applicable reporting billing payment and recordkeeping requirements other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our us federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

environmental health and safety laws 

in the united states and other countries we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including laws regulating the production or use of hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of these laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

laws relating to foreign trade and operations 

us and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 





similarly we are subject to us and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws among other things these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for example in february 2020 we paid approximately 84 million to the securities and exchange commission to settle charges that our internal controls were not sufficient to detect improper payments made by employees of our former china distribution business 





other information 

although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain customer contracts require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return product for credit that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers 






 



risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in the risk factors below additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may arise or may amplify many of the risks discussed below 

we have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

see the description of the actual and possible effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting disruptions on our business and operations discussed above in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in addition to the adverse impacts and uncertainties from the covid19 pandemic identified there we face additional possible adverse impacts including those described below 

the cost to manufacture and source certain ppe products has significantly increased which negatively impacted our margins for these products in fiscal 2020 and is expected to negatively impact our medical segment profit in fiscal 2021 while we are seeking alternate and additional sources for these products and otherwise seeking to mitigate cost increases as well as increasing certain ppe product prices to reflect some of our higher costs and seeking to modify affected customer contracts our segment profit may be adversely impacted more significantly than we expect to the extent these efforts are not successful in addition we could experience decreased sales and customer disputes 

federal state and local government policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 also resulted in the cancellation or deferral of many elective medical procedures and some of our customers closing or severely curtailing their operations if demand for these procedures does not return or if these policies remain effective over a sustained period we could experience a greater decrease in sales for the affected products and services than we currently expect additionally sustained changes in the manner in which patients access healthcare may result in shifts in consumer preferences that may not be favorable to us 

political legal or regulatory actions as a result of the covid19 pandemic in jurisdictions where we manufacture source or distribute products have created supply disruptions within both our medical and currently to a lesser extent our pharmaceutical segments and from time to time may cause additional supply disruptions or shortages in the future we cannot currently predict the frequency duration or scope of these governmental actions and supply disruptions for example several countries including india and china have increased or instituted new restrictions on the export of medical or pharmaceutical products that we distribute or use in our businesses including key components or raw materials additionally 

 

governmental authorities in many countries including the us are enacting legislative or regulatory changes to address the impact of the pandemic which may restrict or require changes in our operations increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations 

as a critical player in the global healthcare supply chain we participated in industrywide collaboration with the us government and other distributors intended to increase the availability of ppe in the us in connection with these efforts we along with other distributor participants have received information requests from several members of the us congress 

also we may become subject to claims or lawsuits by employees customers suppliers or other parties regarding actions we take in our operations in response to the pandemic financial hardship to our customers and others could adversely impact the timing and collectability of payments to us from customers and require an increase in reserves against our accounts receivable 

we cannot estimate the length or severity of the covid19 pandemic or the related consequences on the us and global economy and our business and operations including whether and when normal economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business financial position results of operations or cash flow the covid19 pandemic also may give rise to new risks or heighten many of the risks we have previously identified including risks associated with competitive pressures supplier relationships international operations regulatory and licensing changes to the us healthcare environment cyber security and access to capital markets covid19 may also adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider a significant risk 

we could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic in addition competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical segments may be increased by new business models new entrants new regulations changes in consumer demand or general competitive dynamics our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors which adversely affects our margins if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program may be adversely affected by pricing changes and fewer product launches 

the performance of our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program declined in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 and increased in fiscal 2020 declines in earlier years were due in large part to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing deflation and less incremental benefit from new generic pharmaceutical launches 





which more than offset the benefits from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs if performance of our generic pharmaceutical program declines in future fiscal years and we are unable to offset the decline our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will be adversely affected 

the extent and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical pricing changes is uncertain in future fiscal years and may vary from what we anticipate similarly the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches also varies from year to year and the margin impact of these launches varies from product to product finally the benefit from red oak sourcing could be less than we anticipate 

changes in manufacturer approaches to pricing branded pharmaceutical products could have an adverse effect on our pharmaceutical segment’s margins 

compensation under our contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost 

historically pharmaceutical manufacturers have generally increased the wholesale acquisition cost of their branded pharmaceuticals each year however the us government has announced plans to among other things adopt policies to encourage manufacturers to limit increases in or reduce wholesale acquisition cost in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 manufacturers in the aggregate increased prices less than in prior years if manufacturers change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings could be adversely affected 

also almost all of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them however under a limited number of agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as a part of our compensation if manufacturers decide to reduce prices not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our margins could be adversely affected 

the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business  

our pharmaceutical segment distributes prescription opioid pain medications in recent years the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication has become a public health crisis 

a significant number of states counties municipalities and other public plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmaceutical wholesale distributors including us 

 

retail chains and others relating to the manufacturing marketing or distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and additional public plaintiffs are likely to file similar lawsuits in addition we are currently being sued by private plaintiffs such as unions other health and welfare funds hospital systems and other healthcare providers for the same activities and could be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits 

we have also received federal grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with investigations being conducted by the us attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york and by the fraud section of the us department of justice doj the subpoenas seek documents and with respect to the doj investigation testimony relating to our antidiversion policies and procedures and our distribution of certain controlled substances 

in october 2019 we agreed in principle to a settlement framework that would resolve pending and future lawsuits and claims brought by states and political subdivisions in connection with this development we recorded a pretax accrual of 556 billion in fiscal 2020 this settlement framework is subject to contingencies but is the basis for our negotiation of definitive terms and documentation definitive terms of a settlement under the settlement framework continue to be negotiated and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these matters 

the defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits and events relating to these lawsuits are subject to uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity or our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares beyond the amounts accrued in addition they could have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business 

other legislative regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and the distribution of these medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example several states have now adopted taxes or other fees on the sale of opioids and several other states have proposed similar legislative initiatives these laws and proposals vary in the tax amounts imposed and the means of calculation liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted 

ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits investigations regulations and legislative actions and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations 





products that we manufacture source and market are subject to strict quality and regulatory requirements the recalls of certain surgical gowns and related presource procedure packs had a negative impact on our financial results in fiscal 2020 and may have additional negative financial and operational impacts 

as described in greater detail in the business section products that we manufacture source distribute or market must comply with quality and regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance including noncompliance by thirdparty contract manufacturers may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import manufacture or source products as well as product bans recalls safety alerts or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions which in turn could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device or other product and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

in january 2020 we issued a voluntary recall for 91 million aami level 3 surgical gowns and two voluntary field actions a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs for 29 million presource procedure packs containing affected gowns together the recalls because one of our fdaregistered suppliers in china had shifted production of some gowns to unapproved sites with uncontrolled environments because of this we could not assure sterility of the gowns 

in connection with the recalls in fiscal year 2020 we recorded a total charge of 85 million  of which 48 million is within cost of products sold and 37 million is within sga in the consolidated statements of earningsloss see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these matters 

in addition the recalls may have other negative impacts which could include government investigations and enforcement actions by the us food and drug administration or other regulators or us or international governmental bodies which could possibly result in the suspension or revocation of the authority to produce distribute and sell products and other civil or criminal sanctions or penalties 

our business is subject to other rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

in addition to regulatory requirements relating to manufacturing sourcing and marketing our products described in the risk factor immediately above and as described in greater detail in the business section our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits product registrations licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies for example as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances we must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and 

 

operating standards and comply with the csa failure to maintain or renew necessary permits product registrations licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information regulations currently in place continue to evolve and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect handle and maintain personal or patient information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations violations of federal state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties breach of contract claims costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations from time to time regulatory authorities investigate our policies or practices and may challenge them if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs such as state medicaid program and the federal 340b drug pricing program in addition some businesses manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply or are alleged to fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions for example in february 2020 we paid approximately 84 million to the securities and exchange commission to settle charges that our internal controls were not sufficient to detect improper payments made by employees of our former china distribution business 





we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 

from time to time initiatives are proposed in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate or tax payments specific initiatives that may impact us include possible increases in us or foreign corporate income tax rates or other changes in tax law to raise revenue the repeal of the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes the establishment or increase in taxation at the us state level on the basis of gross revenues recommendations of the recently completed base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission’s investigation into illegal state aid 

additionally in connection with the 563 billion pretax charge for the opioid litigation in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 we recorded a tax benefit of 488 million  which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of 469 million  reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the tax act however these estimates require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation including provisions related to deductibility under the settlement framework have not been negotiated and the us tax law governing deductibility was changed by the tax act further the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these matters 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions including irs challenges to our international transfer pricing for the periods from 2008 to 2014 and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

changes to the us healthcare environment may not be favorable to us 

over a number of years the us healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and patient outcomes contain costs and increase efficiencies these changes include a general decline in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers the basis for payments beginning to transition from a feeforservice model to valuebased payments and risksharing models and the 

 

industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics physician offices and patients’ homes 

we expect the us healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future possible changes include further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits these possible changes and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes may adversely affect us 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems critical facilities and distribution networks 

we rely on our and thirdparty service providers information systems for a wide variety of critical operations including to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our and our suppliers critical facilities including our national logistics center and our distribution networks our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service providers information systems critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted including disruption of access are damaged or fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic or power outage or due to cybersecurity incidents ransomware or other actions of third parties including labor strikes political unrest and terrorist attacks manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action production quality deviations safety issues or raw material shortages or defects or because a key product or component is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities 

from time to time our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes such as receiving and processing customer orders customer service and accounts payable for example our pharmaceutical segment is currently engaged in a multiyear project to implement a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems if any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting 





our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a cyberattack or other systems breach 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive protected information relating to our customers company and workforce we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to information security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition hardware software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security 

unauthorized parties have gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to our or a service providers systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deception we have been the target of cyber attacks including incidents where certain customer account information was accessed although we do not believe these incidents had a material impact on us similar incidents or events in the future may negatively impact our business reputation or financial results 

any compromise of our or a service providers information systems including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements including the california consumer privacy act ccpa the new eu general data protection regulation gdpr and those related to patientidentifiable health information as further described in the risk factor titled “our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements” above 

we depend on direct and indirect suppliers to make their products and raw materials available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs and availability of products and raw materials 

we depend on others to manufacture some products that we market and distribute our operations are also dependent on various components compounds raw materials and energy supplied by others we purchase many of these components raw materials and energy and source certain products from numerous suppliers in various countries in some instances for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted become less favorable to us or be terminated and the supply of these components compounds raw materials or products could be interrupted or become insufficient these risks are currently heightened with respect to certain ppe products due to the current and expected future demand for such products these supply interruptions or other disruptions in manufacturing processes could be caused by events beyond our control including natural disasters supplier facility shutdowns defective raw materials the impact of epidemics or 

 

pandemics such as covid19 and actions by us or international governments including export restrictions or tariffs in addition due to the stringent regulatory requirements regarding the manufacture and sourcing of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components materials or products a sustained supply reduction or interruption and an inability to develop alternative and additional sources for such supply could result in lost sales increased cost damage to our reputation and may have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins pulp cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies and exposure to economic political and currency risks could disrupt our global operations or negatively impact our financial results 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including europe asia and latin america global developments can affect our business in many ways our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and competition additionally divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks related to trade protection laws tariffs excise or other border taxes on goods sourced from certain countries or on the importation or exportation of products or raw materials changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies or tariffs could impact our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers we may be required to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we need or to manufacture certain of our products this could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic many governments including the us china and india have or have considered restrictions on exports of medical and pharmaceutical products if these restrictions are implemented or not lifted we may experience a significant disruption in our ability to source pharmaceutical and medical products and could experience increased prices and lost sales 

in addition we conduct our business in us dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results which are reported in us dollars we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures 





our sales and credit concentration is significant 

cvs is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue cvs accounted for 26 percent of our fiscal 2020 revenue and 26 percent of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2020 if cvs does not renew our agreements terminates the agreements due to an alleged default by us defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases from us our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

consolidation in the us healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations 

in recent years us healthcare industry participants including distributors manufacturers suppliers healthcare providers insurers and pharmacy chains have consolidated or formed strategic alliances consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents if this consolidation trend continues it could adversely affect our results of operations 

legal proceedings could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our business which includes the distribution of controlled substances and other pharmaceutical products and the sourcing marketing and manufacturing of medical products we regularly become involved in disputes litigation and regulatory matters litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

for example we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described above in the risk factor titled the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business and in note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims for example we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava ivc filter products and in lawsuits alleging impurities in the active pharmaceutical ingredients in certain pharmaceutical products in addition product liability insurance for these types of claims is becoming more limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain it is possible that a settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim may not be covered by insurance or exceed available insurance recoveries if this happens and if any such settlement or judgment is in excess of any prior accruals our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale 

 

of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for that business for example in the past few years we divested our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in china and our ownership interest in navihealth inc when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we could also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our results of operations could be greater than anticipated 

our ability to manage and complete acquisitions could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses completion of acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses involve a number of risks including the following we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management’s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties or delays establishing integrating or combining operations and systems including manufacturing facilities we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

we may not realize the expected benefits from planned costsavings and business improvement initiatives 

as a part of an ongoing effort to optimize and simplify our operating model we expect to transition portions of our finance operations to a global professional services firm and we are making structural changes to certain other functional and commercial areas of our organization as well additionally our pharmaceutical segment is in a multiyear project to implement a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems these initiatives and any similar initiatives identified and implemented in the future could result in unexpected charges and expenses that negatively impact our financial results and we could fail to achieve the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings in addition if we are not able to effectively implement these initiatives or if they fail to operate as intended our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

additionally these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of management and employees business disruption an inability to attract or retain key personnel which could negatively affect our business or financial condition and results of operations 





if we are not able to effectively develop implement and manage our outsourcing or similar thirdparty relationships we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our goodwill may be further impaired which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us gaap requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 we recorded a 14 billion impairment to goodwill within our medical segment the testing required by gaap involves estimates and significant judgments by management although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate any changes in key assumptions including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates it is possible that we may record significant charges related to other reporting units or we may record additional charges in our medical segment which charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates in mda above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing

consolidated results 

fiscal 2020 overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2020 was 1529 billion  a 5 percent increase from the prior year primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers 

gaap and nongaap operating earnings 



the sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments 

we had a gaap operating loss of 41 billion during fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 563 billion pretax charge we recognized for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications as described in the significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements gaap operating earnings during fiscal 2019 were favorably impacted by a 508 million pretax gain from the divestiture of a majority interest in our navihealth holdings llc navihealth business 

the increase in nongaap operating earnings was primarily due to the beneficial impact of enterprisewide costsavings measures a higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales mix the favorable yearoveryear impact of fiscal 2019 charges related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a medical segment supplier and growth from specialty solutions partially offset by the adverse impact of pharmaceutical segment customer contract renewals and the adverse impact of the pandemic associated with the novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” see the significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section of this mda 

gaap and nongaap diluted eps 

the sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments 







we had a 1261 gaap diluted loss per share attributable to cardinal health inc gaap diluted eps during fiscal 2020 due to the charge we recognized for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications the charge had a 1754 per share after tax impact on gaap diluted eps gaap diluted eps during fiscal 2020 was favorably impacted by a 168 per share gain from the sale of the remainder of our equity interest in navihealth described further in significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section in this mda and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements gaap diluted eps during fiscal 2019 included a 126 per share gain from the divestiture of our majority interest in navihealth 

fiscal 2020 nongaap diluted eps increased 3 to 545  this increase was primarily due to the factors discussed above impacting nongaap operating earnings as well as a lower share count as a result of share repurchases and lower interest expense due to less debt outstanding and lower interest rates the yearoveryear comparison was unfavorably impacted by a higher effective tax rate due to the benefit in the prioryear from discrete tax items largely related to international legal entity changes 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 28 billion at june 30 2020 compared to 25 billion at june 30 2019  the increase in cash during fiscal 2020 was due to net cash provided by operating activities of 20 billion and 886 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of investments offset by cash deployed of 14 billion for debt repayments 569 million for dividends and 350 million for share repurchases 





significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends 

covid19 



the covid19 pandemic continues to severely impact the us and global economies our businesses have been impacted in a variety of ways beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as discussed in the following paragraphs and under “results of operations” we estimate that the covid19 pandemic had a net negative impact to operating earningsloss of approximately 100 million in fiscal 2020 

within our manufacturing and distribution facilities we have implemented sustained protocols designed to protect the safety of our employees and maintain continuity of our operations and have generally continued to operate our distribution and manufacturing facilities in the ordinary course of business additionally in line with various governmental recommendations to reduce large gatherings and practice social distancing we have enabled most officebased employees to work remotely these measures have created additional burdens on our infrastructure and information technology systems furthermore if a significant number of our employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time we may experience difficulties in operating one or more of our facilities which could adversely impact our financial results 

since the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our medical segment has seen dramatically increased demand for certain personal protective equipment “ppe” such as masks gowns and gloves we manufacture source and distribute some ppe products and distribute ppe manufactured by others this increased demand resulted in an increase in sales volume for certain products in fiscal 2020 the cost to manufacture and source certain ppe products has also significantly increased which had a slight negative impact on our margin for these products in fiscal 2020 and is expected to have a larger negative impact in fiscal 2021 we continue to seek alternate and additional sources for these products and otherwise mitigate cost increases we also are increasing certain ppe product prices to reflect some of our higher costs and are seeking to modify affected customer contracts if these efforts are unsuccessful our margins may be adversely impacted even more significantly in addition we could experience decreased sales and customer disputes 

federal state and local governmental policies and orders and certain private initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 also resulted in among other things the cancellation or deferral of many elective medical procedures and some of our customers closing or severely curtailing their operations as a result our medical segment has experienced decreased sales volume apart from ppe products described above which had a negative impact on medical segment profit in fiscal 2020 and which we currently assume will have a negative impact in fiscal 2021 the decrease in elective procedures and physician office visits has also resulted in a significant decrease in sales by our nuclear and precision health solutions division in our pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2020 fluctuating or decreasing elective procedure volume may have a greater or lesser adverse impact on the sales of these products and services than we anticipate 

our pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions businesses experienced a temporary increase in sales volume during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 which we believe to be related to accelerated purchasing by some customers due to the covid19 pandemic and which was largely offset by a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we assume fiscal 2021 pharmaceutical segment revenue will be negatively impacted by covid19 and we are uncertain when sales volume will return to precovid19 levels 

political legal or regulatory actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic in certain jurisdictions where we manufacture source or distribute products have created supply disruptions within both our medical and to a lesser extent our pharmaceutical segments and are likely to cause additional supply disruptions or shortages in the future we cannot currently predict the frequency duration or scope of these governmental actions and supply disruptions for example several countries have increased or instituted new restrictions on the export of medical or pharmaceutical products that we distribute or use in our businesses including key components or raw materials additionally governmental authorities in many countries including the us are considering enacting legislative or regulatory changes to address the impact of the pandemic which may restrict or require changes in our operations increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

in march 2020 the us enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act which provided a variety of benefits for businesses as a result of the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2020 we received a cash flow benefit related to the deferral of payroll and income tax payments and a small tax benefit from the employee retention credit under this act 

we currently anticipate that the covid19 pandemic will have a further negative impact on fiscal 2021 consolidated operating earnings and medical segment profit however we cannot estimate the length or severity of the covid19 pandemic or of the related us or global economic consequences on our business and operations including whether and when historic economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business financial position results of operations or cash flow and its impact maybe greater or less than we anticipate 





opioid lawsuits 



in october 2019 we agreed in principle to a global settlement framework with a leadership group of state attorneys general that is designed to resolve all pending and future opioid lawsuits and claims by states and political subdivisions but not private plaintiffs the settlement framework this settlement framework is subject to contingencies and uncertainties as to final terms but is the basis for our negotiation of definitive terms and documentation the settlement framework includes 1 a cash component pursuant to which we would pay up to 556 billion over eighteen years  2 development and participation in a program for free or rebated distribution of opioid abuse treatment medications for a period of ten years and 3 tobe specified industrywide changes to distributor controlled substance antidiversion programs we also agreed with two other national distributors to a 215 million settlement with two plaintiff counties our portion of that settlement was 66 million which was paid in january 2020 

in connection with these matters we recorded a total pretax charge of 563 billion  514 billion after tax during fiscal year 2020 in litigation recoveriescharges net in the consolidated statement of earningsloss for the cash component we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events moreover definitive terms for a settlement pursuant to the settlement framework continue to be negotiated and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied we regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

also in connection with these matters we recorded a tax benefit of 488 million  which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of 469 million  during fiscal 2020  reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the 563 billion accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits our assumptions and estimates around this benefit and uncertain tax position require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation including provisions related to deductibility under the settlement framework have not been negotiated and the us tax law governing deductibility was changed by the us tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the tax act further it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates see note 8 of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

gain on sale of equity interest in navihealth 



as described further in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in may 2020 we sold the remainder of our equity interest in a partnership that owned navihealth we recognized a pretax gain of 579 million  493 million after tax from this disposal in gain on sale of equity interest in navihealth in our consolidated statements of earningsloss 

other trends 



in addition to the trends and uncertainties described above under the caption significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends the performance of our pharmaceutical segment generics program which includes generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes and red oak sourcing adversely impacted pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 however in fiscal 2020 our generics program had a slightly favorable impact on pharmaceutical segment profit as is generally the case the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes customer contract renewals and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain and their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2021 could be more or less than we expect 





results of operations 

revenue 





fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2020 pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers which together increased revenue by 76 billion  

medical segment 

fiscal 2020 medical segment revenue decreased due to the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by sales growth from cardinal health athome solutions 

cost of products sold 



cost of products sold f or fiscal 2020 increased 74 billion  5 percent  due to the factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin 





gross margin 





fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 



fiscal 2020 consolidated gross margin is essentially flat with growth from pharmaceutical specialty solutions and higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales mostly offset by the adverse impact of pharmaceutical segment customer contract renewals gross margin comparison to the prior year benefitted from the fiscal 2019 charges related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a medical segment supplier 

gross margin rate declined during fiscal 2020 mainly due to the adverse impact of pharmaceutical customer contract renewals and changes in pharmaceutical distribution product mix 

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





  

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 



fiscal 2020 sga expenses increased due to higher costs to support sales growth and a 37 million charge in connection with a voluntary recall for association for the advancement of medical instrumentation aami level 3 surgical gowns and a voluntary recall and field actions for surgical procedure packs containing affected gowns together the recalls as described further within   note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 





segment profit 



we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit among other measures see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2020 pharmaceutical segment profit decreased largely due to the adverse impact of customer contract renewals partially offset by higher contribution from our branded pharmaceutical sales mix and growth from specialty solutions 

pharmaceutical segment financial results do not include the 563 billion charge associated with the opioid litigation see significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2020 medical segment profit increased largely due to benefits from costsavings measures and the favorable yearoveryear impact of the fiscal 2019 charges related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a medical segment supplier  partially offset by decreased sales resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

medical segment financial results do not include the 85 million charge incurred during fiscal 2020 in connection with the recalls as described further within note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate 

the changes in corporate during fiscal 2020 are due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earningsloss section that follows 





other components of consolidated operating earningsloss 



in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed previously consolidated operating earningsloss were impacted by the following 



restructuring and employee severance 

in fiscal 2020 and 2019  restructuring costs are primarily related to implementation of certain enterprisewide costsavings measures 

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 512 million and 531 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively 

transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the patient recovery business were 7 million and 75 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively 

impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets net 

during fiscal 2019  we recognized a pretax gain of 508 million related to the divestiture of our majority interest in navihealth see also “gain on sale of equity interest in navihealth” below with respect to the sale of the remainder of our equity interest in navihealth in fiscal 2020 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2020  we recognized a pretax charge of 563 billion  514 billion after tax associated with the opioid litigation see significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section in this mda and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2020 and 2019  we recognized 103 million and 117 million  respectively of estimated losses and legal defense costs associated with inferior vena cava ivc filter product liability claims 

during fiscal 2020 and 2019  we recognized income of 16 million and 94 million  respectively for recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member 

other components of earningsloss before income taxes 



in addition to the items discussed above earningsloss before income taxes was impacted by the following 



interest expense net 

 

fiscal 2020 interest expense decreased from fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower debt outstanding and lower interest rates 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during fiscal 2020  we recognized a 16 million loss in connection with the redemption and early debt repurchases as described further in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of equity interest in navihealth 

during fiscal 2020  we recognized a pretax gain of 579 million from the sale of our equity interest in a partnership that owned navihealth as described further in the significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section of this mda and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also “impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets net” above with respect to the fiscal 2019 sale of our majority interest in navihealth 





provision for income taxes 



generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the distribution of income among taxing jurisdictions with differing income tax rates and other reconciling items 

a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 



 fiscal 2020 



the fiscal 2020 effective income tax rate was impacted by the settlement framework as described further in the significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section in this mda 

ongoing audits 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions including us internal revenue service irs challenges to our international transfer pricing for the periods from 2008 to 2014 and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based on available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion contractual obligations tax payments and current and projected debt service requirements early extinguishment of debt dividends and share repurchases as well as potential opioid litigation settlement payments associated with the settlement framework if we decide to engage in one or more acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing todate the covid19 pandemic has not resulted in material changes to our liquidity and capital resources and has not impacted our ability to comply with financial commitments 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 28 billion at june 30 2020 compared to 25 billion at june 30 2019  the increase in cash during fiscal 2020 was due to net cash provided by operating activities of 20 billion  which reflects increases to working capital associated with the timing of payments to vendors and 886 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of investments substantially all of which was related to the sale of our equity interest in navihealth offset by cash deployed of 14 billion for debt repayments 569 million for dividends and 350 million for share repurchases at june 30 2020  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

during fiscal 2019  our cash and equivalents increased by 700 million due to 27 billion of net cash provided by operating activities and 737 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our majority interest in navihealth offset by 11 billion paid for debt repayments 600 million paid for share repurchases 577 million paid in dividends and 328 million paid for capital expenditures 

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases payments to vendors and tax 

 

payments in the regular course of business as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2020 included 476 million of cash and equivalents held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 

in june 2020 we returned 140 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the us 

as of june 30 2020  foreign earnings of approximately 800 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs the computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable for amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our financial statements in fiscal 2020

in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow other sources of liquidity at june 30 2020 include a 20 billion commercial paper program backed by a 20 billion revolving credit facility we also have a 10 billion committed receivables sales facility at june 30 2020  we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility during fiscal 2020  under our commercial paper program and our committed receivables program we had maximum combined total daily amounts outstanding of 17 billion and an average combined daily amount outstanding of  195 million  

our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facilities require us to maintain as of the end of every fiscal quarter through december 2020 a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 400to1 the maximum permitted ratio will reduce to 375to1 in march 2021 and as of the end of every quarter thereafter  as of june 30 2020  we were in compliance with this financial covenant

the redemption and repurchases were paid for with available cash and other shortterm borrowings 

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability 

 

we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as note 1 and note 10 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

capital deployment 



opioid settlement framework 

in october 2019 we agreed in principle to a settlement framework which includes a cash component pursuant to which we would pay up to 556 billion over eighteen years if a definitive agreement is reached and subject to participation by states and political subdivisions we expect payment amounts under the settlement framework to be spread through the 18year period we cannot currently predict when those payments might begin and it is possible that they may ultimately be made over a different time period or not at all see significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section in this mda for additional information 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 375 million and 328 million  respectively

minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and approximate timing of the transaction the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table in addition contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period purchase obligations and other payments also includes quarterly payments of  456 million that we are required to pay cvs health corporation cvs in connection with red oak sourcing and will be in place for the remaining five years of the agreement see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2020  as that term is defined in the sec rules 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted and continues to severely impact the us and global economies and beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our businesses have been impacted in a variety of ways we cannot estimate the length or severity of the covid19 pandemic or the related us and global economic consequences on our business and operations including whether and when normal economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business financial position results of operations or cash flow our e stimates judgments and assumptions related to the covid19 pandemic could ultimately differ over time  

allowance for doubtful accounts 



the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions including the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic may affect credit risks see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts 

a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2020  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 8 million  we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2020 are appropriate 

at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue in addition the financial accounting standards board ’s amended accounting guidance that requires entities to measure credit losses 

 

on trade and other receivables using an expected credit loss model that considers historical experience current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we have evaluated the impact of adopting this new guidance and have determined it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures the following table presents information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

inventories 



a substantial portion of our inventories  56 percent at both june 30 2020 and 2019  are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment “distribution facilities” the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earningsloss depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend historically prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise resulting in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for inventories 

 

using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost 





we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation at june 30 2020 and 2019  respectively inventories valued at lifo cost were 411 million and 230 million higher than the average cost value we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not writeup the value of our inventory from average cost to lifo cost at june 30 2020 or 2019  

our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of lifo cost or market is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or net realizable value net realizable value is defined as 

 

the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 155 million and 171 million at june 30 2020 and 2019  respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific categories of inventory age and expiration dates of onhand inventory and manufacturer return policies 

if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount there is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for the annual goodwill impairment test in the current year the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions which are components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear and precision health solutions division nuclear and precision health solutions division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health athome solutions division “medical unit” and cardinal health athome solutions division 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of repo rting units qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and if necessary the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit 

our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches using discount rates ranging from 85 percent to 105 percent   we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our 

 

internallydeveloped forecasts under the marketbased guideline public company method we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets we also use the marketbased guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions changes in the industry or peer groups or changes in weightings assigned to the discounted cash flow method guideline public company method or guideline transaction method could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment if a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or operating cash flow or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018 and with the exception of our medical unit in fiscal 2018  concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

for our annual impairment test in fiscal 2020 the fair value of our medical unit exceeded its carrying value of 101 billion by approximately 7 percent for this test we used a discount rate of 85 percent and a terminal growth rate of 2 percent additionally we assigned a weighting of 80 percent to the discounted cash flow method 10 percent to the guideline public company method and 10 percent to the guideline transaction method the goodwill balance for our medical unit was 42 billion at june 30 2020  

adverse changes in key assumptions such as assumptions related to the covid19 pandemic which could cause a decrease in future cash flows an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate among other things could result in a goodwill impairment for the medical unit for example if we were to use a 





discount rate of 95 percent the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value for our medical unit by 50 percent for fiscal 2020 similarly if we were to use a terminal growth rate of 05 percent the carrying value would have exceed the fair value for our medical unit by less than 10 percent for fiscal 2020 for any of our other reporting units the fair value would not have been less than the carrying amount for fiscal 2020 if we increased the discount rate by 10 percentage point or decreased the terminal growth rate by 10 percentage point as discussed further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recognized a 14 billion goodwill impairment charge related to our medical unit which is included in impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earningsloss there was no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge 

 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily iprd involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if so then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the respective assets carrying amount our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 

see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

loss contingencies and selfinsurance 



we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

we also selfinsure for employee healthcare certain product liability matters auto liability property and workers compensation and maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits when available 

selfinsurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs administrative fees claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information related to each claim if available other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period 

we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

 

examples of such contingencies include various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the cordis ivc filter lawsuits 

in connection with the opioid litigation as described further in the significant developments in fiscal 2020 and trends section in this mda we recorded a pretax charge of 563 billion   514 billion after tax during fiscal 2020 definitive terms of a settlement under the settlement framework continue to be negotiated and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied 

we develop and periodically update reserve estimates for the cordis inferior vena cava cordis ivc claims including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs to project future cordis ivc claim costs we use a methodology based largely on recent experience including claim filing rates estimated indemnity severity by claim type sales data implant and injury to report lag patterns and estimated defense costs 

the amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits 





provision for income taxes 



we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



 expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above we operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

in connection with the 563 billion pretax charge for the opioid litigation during fiscal year 2020  we recorded a tax benefit of 488 million  which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of 469 million  reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on managements judgment and our current understanding of the tax act however these estimates require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation including provisions related to deductibility under the settlement framework have not been negotiated and the us tax law governing deductibility was changed by the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act further it is possible that the tax authorities 

 

could challenge our interpretation of the tax act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits the actual amount of the tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates see note 8 for more information regarding these matters 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions including irs challenges to our international transfer pricing for the periods from 2008 to 2014 and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets for a further discussion on provision for income taxes see note 8 of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the us tax code as per the tax act as enacted by the united states government on december 22 2017 we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the tax act which is subject to further interpretation by the internal revenue service irs see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding the tax act

pharmaceutical distribution 

our pharmaceutical distribution division’s gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical program from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and from overthecounter healthcare and consumer products it also includes manufacturer cash discounts 

margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts and rebates from manufacturers and may in limited instances include price appreciation our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time 

margin from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers is derived from compensation we receive for providing a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers our compensation typically is a percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost that is set by manufacturers in addition under a limited number of agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as part of our compensation

suppliers 



we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 42 percent  of our revenue during fiscal 2019  and our largest supplier’s products accounted for approximately 10 percent  of revenue 

competition 



we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare products we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the manufacturing and distribution of medical devices and surgical products we compete on many levels including price service offerings support services breadth of product lines and product quality and efficacy 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies companies that provide specialty pharmaceutical services and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the 

 

pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers we also compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly 

in the medical segment we compete with many diversified healthcare companies and national medical product distributors such as medline industries inc owens  minor inc and becton dickinson and company as well as regional medical product distributors and companies that are focused on specific product categories we also compete with companies that distribute medical products to patients homes and thirdparty logistics companies 

employees 



at june 30 2019  we had approximately 31000 employees in the united states and approximately 18500 employees outside of the united states 

intellectual property 



we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents and continue to pursue patent protection throughout the world relating to the manufacture operation and use of various medical and surgical products to certain distribution and logistics systems to the production and distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and to other service offerings we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 

 

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 





regulatory matters 



our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon the specific business we may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements they can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products require us to initiate product recalls seize products or impose criminal civil and administrative sanctions 

distribution 

state boards of pharmacy fda dea and various other state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal prescription drug marketing act of 1987 drug quality and security act of 2013 the “dqsa” and controlled substances act the csa the csa governs the sale packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards including effective antidiversion programs and comply with the csa they must also comply with state requirements relating to controlled substances that differ from state to state 

manufacturing and marketing 

we sell our manufactured products in the united states canada europe asia latin america and other markets the fda and other governmental agencies in the united states as well as foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing including good manufacturing practices quality systems labeling promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the products cleared or approved uses distribution importation and postmarket surveillance for most of our manufactured products in addition we need specific approval or clearance from and registrations with regulatory authorities before 

 

we can market and sell some products in the united states and certain other countries including countries in the european union eu 

in the united states authorization to commercially market a medical device is generally received in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval “pma” requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective many of our medical segment products are cleared through the 510k process and certain products must be approved through the pma process   

in the eu we are required to comply with the medical device directive mdd and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the eu regulatory bodies finalized a new medical device regulation mdr in 2017 which will replace the existing mdd after a threeyear transition period under the mdr medical devices marketed in the eu will require certification under its requirements except that devices with valid ce mark issued before may 2020 can be marketed until may 2024 

it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals clearances and registrations of medical devices and they might not be granted on a timely basis if at all even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight including periodic inspection of manufacturing facilities by fda and other regulatory authorities both in the united states and internationally 

from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action which may include recalling the product correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers 

health and personal information practices and privacy 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information the us health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and state laws regulate the use and disclosure of patientidentifiable health information including requiring specified privacy and security measures we also collect handle and maintain other sensitive personal and financial information that is subject to us federal and state laws protecting such information 

additionally the new california consumer privacy act ccpa effective in january 2020 grants additional rights for consumers over the use of their personal information that we hold including increased transparency other us states are considering adopting similar or different privacy laws 





the processing and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate in europe for example we are subject to the eu data protection regulations including the current eu directive on data protection which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection use and transfer of personal data the eu general data protection regulation gdpr includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 

our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities including for xofigo require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the nrc applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate including pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices in addition our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities also must comply with fda regulations including good manufacturing practices 

product tracing and supply chain integrity 

title ii of the dqsa known as the drug supply chain security act or track and trace establishes a phasedin national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs the first phase of implementation began in 2015 and upon full implementation in 2023 we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug tracing system in addition the fda also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier these regulations are being phased in through 2020 the mdr finalized in the eu in 2017 also introduces a new unique device identifier requirement with a threeyear transition period 

government healthcare programs 

we are subject to us federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws these laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order recommend or purchase products or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded healthcare programs they also prohibit submitting any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government there are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to medicaid and other statefunded healthcare programs violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare 

 

programs such as state medicaid programs and the federal 340b drug pricing program these businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations including applicable reporting billing payment and recordkeeping requirements other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our us federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

environmental health and safety laws 

in the united states and other countries we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including laws regulating the production or use of hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of these laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

laws relating to foreign trade and operations 

us and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 

similarly we are subject to us and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws among other things these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 





other information   

although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return product for credit that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers 






 



risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic in addition competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical segments may be increased by new business models new entrants new regulations changes in consumer demand or general competitive dynamics our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors which adversely affects our margins if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program may continue to be adversely affected by pricing changes and fewer product launches 

the performance of our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program declined in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 and is expected to decline again in fiscal 2020 these declines have been due in large part to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing deflation and less incremental benefit from new generic pharmaceutical launches which have more than offset the benefits from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs if performance of the generic pharmaceutical program continues to decline and we continue to be unable to offset the decline our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will continue to be adversely affected 

the extent and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical pricing changes is uncertain in future fiscal years and may vary from what we anticipate similarly the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches also varies from year to year and the margin impact of these launches varies from product to product finally the benefit from red oak sourcing could be less than we anticipate 

changes in manufacturer approaches to pricing branded pharmaceutical products could have an adverse effect on our pharmaceutical segment’s margins 

compensation under our contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost 

historically pharmaceutical manufacturers have generally increased the wholesale acquisition cost of their branded pharmaceuticals each year however the us government has announced plans to among 

 

other things adopt policies to encourage manufacturers to limit increases in or reduce wholesale acquisition cost in fiscal 2019 manufacturers in the aggregate increased prices less than in prior years if manufacturers change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings could be adversely affected 

also almost all of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them however under a limited number of agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as a part of our compensation if manufacturers decide to reduce prices not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our margins could be adversely affected 

the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication could have a material negative effect on our business 

our pharmaceutical segment distributes prescription opioid pain medications in recent years the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication has become a public health crisis 

a significant number of counties municipalities and other plaintiffs including a number of state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmaceutical wholesale distributors including us retail chains and others relating to the manufacturing marketing or distribution of prescription opioid pain medications in addition we are currently being investigated or sued by most other states for the same activities and expect to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits and events relating to these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows or liquidity or have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these matters 

other legislative regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and the distribution of these medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example several states have now adopted taxes or other fees on the sale of opioids and several other states have proposed similar legislative initiatives these laws and proposals vary in the tax amounts imposed and the means of calculation liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted 





ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits investigations regulations and legislative actions and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

as described in greater detail in the business section our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits product registrations licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies for example as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances we must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa failure to maintain or renew necessary permits product registrations licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

products that we manufacture source distribute or market must comply with regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product bans recalls or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions which in turn could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information regulations currently in place continue to evolve and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect handle and maintain personal or patient information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations violations of federal state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties breach of contract claims costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations from time to time regulatory authorities investigate our policies or practices and may challenge them if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or 

 

state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs such sanctions and damages could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs such as state medicaid program and the federal 340b drug pricing program in addition some businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 

from time to time initiatives are proposed in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate or tax payments specific initiatives that may impact us include the repeal of the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes the establishment or increase in taxation at the us state level on the basis of gross revenues recommendations of the recently completed base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission’s investigation into illegal state aid 

tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

changes to the us healthcare environment may not be favorable to us 

over a number of years the us healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and patient outcomes contain costs and increase efficiencies these changes include adoption of the patient protection and affordable care act a general decline in medicare 





and medicaid reimbursement levels efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers the basis for payments beginning to transition from a feeforservice model to valuebased payments and risksharing models and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics physician offices and patients’ homes 

we expect the us healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future possible changes include repeal and replacement of major parts of the patient protection and affordable care act further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits these possible changes and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services which could adversely affect us 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems critical facilities and distribution networks 

we rely on our and thirdparty service providers information systems for a wide variety of critical operations including to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center and our distribution networks our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service providers information systems critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted including disruption of access are damaged or fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic or power outage or due to cybersecurity incidents ransomware or other actions of third parties including labor strikes political unrest and terrorist attacks manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action production quality deviations safety issues or raw material shortages or defects or because a key product or component is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities 

from time to time our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes such as receiving and processing customer orders customer service and accounts payable if any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently 

 

implemented or maintained they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting 

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a cyberattack or other systems breach 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to information security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition hardware software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security 

unauthorized parties have gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to our or a service providers systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deception we have been the target of cyber attacks including incidents where certain customer account information was accessed although we do not believe these incidents had a material impact on us similar incidents or events in the future may negatively impact our business reputation or financial results 

any compromise of our or a service providers information systems including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements including the new eu general data protection regulation gdpr and those related to patientidentifiable health information as further described in the risk factor titled “our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements” above 

cvs is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs accounted for 26 percent of our fiscal 2019 revenue and 24 percent of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2019 in may 2019 we extended our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with cvs through fiscal 2023 if cvs does not renew our agreements terminates the agreements due to an alleged default by us defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases from us our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

consolidation in the us healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations 

in recent years us healthcare industry participants including distributors manufacturers suppliers healthcare providers insurers and pharmacy chains have consolidated or formed strategic alliances consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from 





two incumbents if this consolidation trend continues it could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our business which includes the distribution of controlled substances and the manufacture of medical products we regularly become involved in disputes litigation and regulatory matters litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

for example we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described above in the risk factor titled the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication could negatively affect our business and in note 8  to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims for example we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava ivc filter products we have accrued an amount for losses and legal defense costs related to these lawsuits which are discussed in note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements any settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim that is not covered by insurance and is in excess of any prior accruals could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

our ability to manage and complete acquisitions could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses completion of acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses involve a number of risks including the following we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management’s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties or delays establishing integrating or combining operations and systems including manufacturing facilities we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for that business for example over the past two fiscal years we divested our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in china and our ownership interest in navihealth inc when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we could also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our results of operations could be greater than anticipated 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials and energy supplied by others for our operations in some instances for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted or become less favorable due to events beyond our control including natural disasters us or international foreign policy including tariffs or could be terminated in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials a sustained supply reduction or interruption and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins pulp cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and costsavings initiatives 

we recently announced that we will be undertaking certain costsavings initiatives intended to simplify our operating model and cost structure and we expect to identify and enter into similar initiatives in the future these initiatives could result in unexpected charges and expenses that negatively impact our financial results or we could fail to achieve the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings 

additionally these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of management and employees business disruption an inability to attract or retain key personnel 





which could negatively affect our business or financial condition and results of operations 

if we are not able to effectively develop implement and manage our outsourcing or similar thirdparty relationships we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

as a result of our international operations we have exposure to economic political and currency risks 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including europe asia and latin america global developments can affect our business in many ways our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and competition additionally divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets also can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

in addition we conduct our business in us dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results which are reported in us dollars we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures 

 

changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies or tariffs could disrupt our global operations or negatively impact our financial results 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks related to trade protection laws tariffs excise or other border taxes on goods sourced from certain countries or on the importation or exportation of products or raw materials changes or uncertainty in us or international trade policies or tariffs could impact our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers we may be required to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we need or to manufacture certain of our products this could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our goodwill may be further impaired which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us gaap requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 we recorded a 14 billion impairment to goodwill within our medical segment the testing required by gaap involves estimates and significant judgments by management although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate any changes in key assumptions including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates it is possible that we may record significant charges related to other reporting units or we may record additional charges in our medical segment which charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates in mda above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing

consolidated results 

fiscal 2019  overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2019  was 1455 billion  a 6 percent  increase from the prior year primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty pharmaceutical customers partially offset by the february 2018 divestiture of our china distribution business 

gaap and nongaap operating earnings 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2019  gaap operating earnings increased to 21 billion  from 126 million  during fiscal 2018 nongaap operating earnings decreased 9 percent  to 24 billion  the increase in gaap operating earnings was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge related to our medical segment in the prior year and the current year gain from the divestiture of our navihealth holdings llc navihealth business 

the decrease in nongaap operating earnings was primarily due to the negative impact of our pharmaceutical segment generics program performance of medical segment cardinal health brand products and the adverse impact of pharmaceutical segment customer contract renewals these factors were partially offset by growth from our specialty pharmaceutical products and services business within our pharmaceutical segment the beneficial impact of enterprisewide costsavings measures and higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales and mix 





gaap and nongaap diluted eps 

the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2019  gaap diluted earnings per share attributable to cardinal health inc diluted eps increased to 453  from 081  during fiscal 2018  nongaap diluted eps increased 6 percent  to 528  

fiscal 2019 gaap diluted eps increased primarily due to the increase in gaap operating earnings and the benefits from applying a lower federal statutory tax rate to our us pretax earnings as a result of the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act this increase was partially offset by a 297 per share favorable impact in the prior year from the estimated net transitional benefit from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by the repatriation tax on cash and earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

fiscal 2019 nongaap diluted eps increased primarily due to a 049 per share impact from a lower nongaap effective tax rate in the current period compared to the higher prior year nongaap effective tax rate also contributing to the increase in nongaap diluted eps was a lower share count as a result of share repurchases these factors were partially offset by the decrease in nongaap operating earnings the nongaap effective tax rate is lower in the current year primarily because of the benefits from applying a lower federal statutory tax rate to our us pretax earnings as a result of the tax act 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 25 billion  at june 30 2019  compared to 18 billion  at june 30 2018  the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2019  was due to 27 billion  of net cash provided by operating activities and 737 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our navihealth business offset by 11 billion  of debt repayments 600 million of share repurchases 577 million of dividends and 328 million  of capital expenditures 





significant developments in fiscal 2019  and trends 

divestitures 



navihealth divestiture 

in august 2018 we sold our 98 percent ownership interest in navihealth in exchange for cash proceeds of 737 million  and a 44 percent  equity interest in a partnership that owns 100 percent of navihealth we also have certain call rights to reacquire navihealth we recognized a pretax gain of 508 million related to this divestiture during fiscal 2019 

trends 



within our pharmaceutical segment we expect fiscal 2020 segment profit to be less than our fiscal 2019 segment profit due to the adverse impact of recent customer contract renewals and generics program performance which includes the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes partially offset by the benefits of red oak sourcing as is generally the case the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes customer renewals and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain and their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2020 could be more or less than we expect 

on august 7 2019 we were authorized to incur restructuring costs in connection with certain costsavings initiatives intended to optimize and simplify our operating model and cost structure we expect these costsavings initiatives which will affect various functional and commercial areas across the company to be substantially implemented during fiscal year 2020 as a result of these initiatives we expect to record restructuring charges of approximately 120 million to 145 million the majority of which are expected to be expensed during fiscal year 2020 we may incur additional restructuring charges in connection with other projects 





results of operations 

revenue 





fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018   



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2019  pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty pharmaceutical customers which together increased revenue by 107 billion the increases were partially offset by the february 2018 divestiture of our china distribution business 

medical segment 

fiscal 2019  medical segment revenue was flat compared to fiscal 2018  sales growth from existing customers and the benefit from one additional month of contribution from the patient recovery acquisition were offset by the divestitures of our china distribution and navihealth businesses 

 

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2018   pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty pharmaceutical customers which together increased revenue by 94 billion the increases were partially offset by the previously announced may 2017 expiration of a large pharmaceutical distribution mail order customer contract and the february 2018 divestiture of our china distribution business 

medical segment 

fiscal 2018  medical segment revenue grew mainly due to 19 billion of contributions from acquisitions primarily the patient recovery business acquisition 

cost of products sold 



cost of products sold f or fiscal 2019 and 2018  increased 91 billion   7 percent  and 62 billion   5 percent  compared to the prioryear periods respectively as a result of the same factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin 

 





gross margin 





fiscal   2019   compared to fiscal   2018   

fiscal 2019  consolidated gross margin decreased 347 million  5 percent  due to lower contribution from our pharmaceutical segment generics program performance of medical segments cardinal health brand products the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the adverse impact of pharmaceutical segment customer contract renewals these factors were partially offset by sales growth from our specialty pharmaceutical products and services business and higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales and mix 

gross margin rate declined during fiscal 2019  mainly due to changes in product mix lower contribution from our pharmaceutical segment generics program performance of medical segments cardinal health brand products and the adverse impact of pharmaceutical segment customer contract renewals 

 

fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017   

fiscal 2018   consolidated gross margin increased 637 million 10 percent and was favorably impacted by acquisitions 809 million primarily the patient recovery business acquisition 

gross margin rate grew during fiscal 2018  mainly due to acquisitions primarily the patient recovery business acquisition gross margin rate growth was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in pharmaceutical distribution product mix and performance in our cordis business due to inventory challenges and increased manufacturing costs 

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





               

  

fiscal   2019   compared to fiscal   2018   

fiscal 2019  sga expenses decreased due to the beneficial impact of divestitures and enterprisewide costsavings measures largely offset by certain costs to exit transition service agreements for our patient recovery business and legal expenses for opioidrelated matters 

 

fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017   

fiscal 2018  sga expenses increased mainly due to acquisitions 524 million which primarily consists of the patient recovery business acquisition and enterprisewide compensation related items 





segment profit 



we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit among other measures see note 15  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 



fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2019  pharmaceutical segment profit decreased largely due to our generics program performance the adverse impact of customer contract renewals and legal expenses for opioidrelated matters  our generics program performance includes the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes partially offset by the benefits of red oak sourcing the decreases were partially offset by growth from our specialty pharmaceutical products and services business higher contribution from our branded pharmaceutical sales and mix and the beneficial impact of enterprisewide costsavings measures 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2019  medical segment profit decreased largely due to the performance of cardinal health brand products including incremental supply chain costs charges related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a cordis supplier and increased commodities prices this decrease was partially offset by the benefits from enterprisewide and segment costsavings measures and the prioryear impact of cordis inventory challenges and increased operating costs specific to cordis medical segment profit comparison to the prior year also benefitted from acquisitions and divestitures net which includes the beneficial comparison to the impact in fiscal 

 

2018 from the fair value stepup of inventory acquired with the patient recovery business 

corporate 

the changes in corporate during fiscal 2019  are due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earnings section that follows 





fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2018   pharmaceutical segment profit decreased largely due to our generics program performance and the adverse impact of customer contract renewals performance from our specialty pharmaceutical products distribution and services business positively impacted pharmaceutical segment profit 

medical segment profit 

fiscal   2018   medical segment profit increased largely due to acquisitions inclusive of the unfavorable cost of products sold impact from the fair value step up of inventory acquired with the patient 

 

recovery business acquisition the increase was partially offset by  performance from the cordis business and to a lesser extent performance from other cardinal health brand products the performance from the cordis business primarily reflected inventory challenges and increased operating costs 

corporate 

the changes in corporate during fiscal 2018  were due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earnings section that follows 

other components of consolidated operating earnings 



in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed previously consolidated operating earnings were impacted by the following 



restructuring and employee severance 

during fiscal 2019 we recognized 92 million  of restructuring related costs in connection with enterprisewide costsavings measures that began in fiscal 2019 

during fiscal 2018 we incurred 125 million of contract termination costs to transition the distribution of our medical segment surgeon gloves in certain international markets from a thirdparty distribution arrangement to a direct distribution model 

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 531 million  574 million  and 395 million  for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively 

transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the patient recovery business were 75 million  109 million  and 54 million  during fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively 

 

impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets net 

during fiscal 2019  we recognized a pretax gain of 508 million related to the divestiture of our navihealth business 

during fiscal 2018  we recognized a 14 billion  noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our medical segment as discussed further in note 4  of the notes to consolidated financial statements there was no tax benefit related to this goodwill impairment charge 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  we recognized 117 million 177 million and 24 million respectively of estimated losses and legal defense costs associated with inferior vena cava ivc filter product liability claims 

during fiscal 2019  and 2018 we recognized income of 94 million   and 22 million respectively for   recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member 





earningsloss before income taxes 



in addition to the items discussed above earningsloss before income taxes was impacted by the following 



interest expense net 

 

fiscal 2019 interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt outstanding 

fiscal 2018 interest expense increased primarily due to new debt issued in june 2017 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the patient recovery business acquisition 





provision for income taxes 



generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the distribution of income among taxing jurisdictions with differing income tax rates and other reconciling items 

the fluctuations in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 were primarily due to the prioryear impacts of the net benefits from the enactment of the tax act nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and benefit from a capital loss due to international legal entity reorganization 

a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows   see note 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 



 fiscal 2019   



the fiscal 2019 effective income tax rate was impacted by a lower federal statutory tax rate to our us pretax earnings as a result of the tax act and net discrete benefits of 17 million primarily related to international legal entity changes offset by increases in valuation allowances 

ongoing audits 

the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2008 through 2014 years after 2014 remain open 

 

fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017   



the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate was impacted by various items including benefits from the enactment of the tax act the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges changes in valuation allowances and a benefit from a capital loss due to an international legal entity reorganization 

the net benefit from the tax act for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional net tax benefit of 977 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new federal statutory rate the benefit from the impact of applying a lower federal tax rate to our yeartodate us pretax earnings and a provisional tax expense of 41 million for the onetime repatriation tax applied to our undistributed foreign earnings 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 also includes 59 million of tax expense recognized in connection with the sale of our china distribution business 

the fiscal 2017 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the realignment of foreign subsidiaries in anticipation of closing the acquisition of the patient recovery business and also from deductions related to us production activities the state and local income tax rate decreased primarily due to resolutions with state taxing authorities 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based on available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion contractual obligations tax payments and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 25 billion  at june 30 2019  compared to 18 billion  at june 30 2018  the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2019  was due to 27 billion  of net cash provided by operating activities and 737 million  of net cash proceeds from the sale of our navihealth business offset by 11 billion  paid for debt repayments 600 million  paid for share repurchases 577 million  paid in dividends and 328 million  paid for capital expenditures  at june 30 2019  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

during fiscal 2018  our cash and cash equivalents declined 51 billion due to 61 billion  deployed for acquisitions during the year 954 million  used for debt repayments 581 million paid in dividends   550 million  paid for share repurchases and 384 million paid for capital expenditures offset in part by 28 billion net cash provided by operating activities and 861 million of proceeds from the divestiture of the china distribution business net cash provided by operating activities increased by 16 billion from fiscal 2017 primarily due to working capital changes in part as a result of timing of customer and vendor payments related to the new pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems 

the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2017  of 45 billion was due to proceeds from a 52 billion  debt issuance and 12 billion  provided by operating activities partially offset by 600 million  paid for share repurchases 577 million  paid in dividends and 387 million   

 

paid in capital expenditures and 310 million  in debt repayments the 18 billion decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in working capital as a result of changes in timing of customer and vendor payments some of which related to implementation of the new pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems 

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2019  included 575 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 

in june 2019 we repatriated 318 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries 

during the year ended june 30 2019 we completed the final calculation of the us repatriation tax after the issuance of final regulations by the us treasury department under section 965 after completion of the calculation and an overall review of our cash positions and business needs globally we changed our assertion on 309 million previously considered indefinitely reinvested as of june 30 2018 which did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes  see   note 7   of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the tax act 

other financing arrangements and financial instruments 



credit facilities and commercial paper 

in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow other sources of liquidity at june 30 2019  include a 20 billion  commercial paper program backed by a 20 billion  revolving credit facility we also have a 10 billion committed receivables sales facility at june 30 2019  we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility under our commercial paper program we had a maximum amount outstanding of 785 million  and an average daily amount outstanding of 15 million  during fiscal 2019 

in june 2019 we extended our revolving credit facility through june 2024 the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter on june 30 2019 the maximum permitted ratio was 425to1  the maximum permitted ratio will reduce to 400to1 in september 2019 

 

and to 375 to1 in march 2021 as of june 30 2019  we were in compliance with this financial covenant 

our committed receivables sales facility provides that as of the end of any calendar quarter our maximum consolidated leverage ratio may be no more than 425to1  the maximum permitted ratio will reduce to 400to1 in september 2019 to 375 to1 in march 2020 and to 325to1 in september 2020 as of june 30 2019  we were in compliance with this financial covenant we intend to renew our committed receivables sales facility program in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 





longterm obligations 

at june 30 2019 we had total longterm obligations including the current portion and other shortterm borrowings of 80 billion  in june 2019 we repaid 10 billion 1948 notes at maturity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we repurchased a total of 100 million  of notes due in 2022 and 2027

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as note 1  and note 11  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

capital deployment 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  were 328 million  384 million  and 387 million  respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2020  to be between 320 million and 360 million primarily for information technology and infrastructure projects 

dividends 

during fiscal 2019  we paid quarterly dividends totaling 191  per share an increase of 3 percent  from fiscal 2018  

on may 8 2019 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 04811 per share or 192 per share on an annualized basis which was paid on july 15 2019 to shareholders of record on july 1 2019

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2019  as that term is defined in the sec rules 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 



the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts 

a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2019  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 9 million  we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2019  are appropriate 

 

at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue the following table presents information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

inventories 



a substantial portion of our inventories  56 percent  at both june 30 2019  and 2018  are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment “distribution facilities” the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend historically prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise resulting in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for inventories 

using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost 

 

we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2019  or 2018  because inventories valued at lifo were 230 million  and   92 million  higher than the average cost value at june 30 2019  and 2018  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record a lifo reserve in fiscal 2019  or 2018  

our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of lifo or market is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 171 million  and 147 million  at june 30 2019  and 2018  respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific categories of inventory age and expiration dates of onhand inventory and manufacturer return policies 





if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 



the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date for further discussion of the business combinations accounting policy see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names patents 

 

developed technology inprocess research and development iprd and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives see note 2   of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount there is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for the annual goodwill impairment test in the current year the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component   

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions which are components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear and precision health solutions division nuclear and precision health solutions division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health athome solutions division “medical unit” and cardinal health athome solutions division our nuclear and precision health solutions division was formerly referred to as our nuclear pharmacy services division and our cardinal health athome solutions division was formerly referred to as our cardinal health at home division 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of repo rting units qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and if necessary  the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit our qualitative evaluation considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive 

 

and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches using discount rates ranging from 85 percent  to 115 percent   we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets we also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment if a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 and with the exception of our medical unit in fiscal 2018 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our annual impairment test in fiscal 2019 the fair value of our medical unit exceeded its carrying value of 108 billion by approximately 4 percent for this test we used a discount rate of 85 percent and a terminal growth rate of 2 percent the goodwill balance for our medical unit is 42 billion a decrease in future cash flows an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate among other things could result in a goodwill impairment for the medical unit for example if we were to increase the discount rate by 05 percent the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value for our medical unit by approximately 2 percent for fiscal 2019 similarly if we were to decrease the terminal growth rate by 05 





percent the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value for our medical unit by approximately 3 percent for fiscal 2019 for any of our other reporting units the fair value would not have been less than the carrying amount for fiscal 2019 if we increased the discount rate by 05 percent or decreased the terminal growth rate by 05 percent  as discussed further in note 4  of the notes to consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recognized a 14 billion  goodwill impairment charge related to our medical unit which is included in impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings there was no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily iprd involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite 

 

lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if so then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the respective assets carrying amount our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and  considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 

see note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

loss contingencies and selfinsurance 



we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

we also selfinsure for employee healthcare certain product liability matters auto liability property and workers compensation and maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits when available 

selfinsurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs administrative fees claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information 

 

related to each claim if available other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period 

we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

examples of such contingencies include various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the cordis ivc filter lawsuits 

we develop and periodically update reserve estimates for cordis ivc claims including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs to project future cordis ivc claim costs we use a methodology based largely on recent experience including claim filing rates estimated indemnity severity by claim type sales data and estimated defense costs 

the amount of loss may differ from these estimates see note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits 





provision for income taxes 



we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



 expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above we operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates see note 7  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets for a further 

 

discussion on provision for income taxes see note 7  of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the us tax code as per the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act as enacted by the united states government on december 22 2017 we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the tax act which is subject to further interpretation by the internal revenue service irs see note 7  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding the tax act 





explanation and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

this report including the fiscal 2019  overview section within mda contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap 

in addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate our performance engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and in some circumstances are more closely correlated to the performance of our underlying ongoing business we provide these nongaap financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a yearoveryear basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors however the nongaap financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated 

exclusions from nongaap financial measures 

management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the nongaap measures presented in this report for its own and for investors’ assessment of the business for the reasons identified below 







measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings   

the tax effect for each of the items listed above other than the transitional tax benefit item is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdictions in which the item is recorded the gross tax and net impact of each item are presented with our gaap to nongaap reconciliations

pharmaceutical distribution 

our pharmaceutical distribution division’s gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical program from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and from overthecounter healthcare and consumer products it also includes manufacturer cash discounts 

margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts and rebates from manufacturers and may in some instances include price appreciation our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time 

margin from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers is derived primarily from compensation we receive for providing a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers our compensation typically is a percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost that is set by manufacturers in addition under a limited number of agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as part of our compensation 

sourcing venture with cvs health corporation

we have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their 

 

members our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with vizient inc and premier inc sales to members of these two gpos under numerous contracts across all of our businesses collectively accounted for 22 percent  of our revenue in fiscal 2018  

suppliers 



we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 29 percent  of our revenue during fiscal 2018  but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 8 percent  of revenue 

competition 



we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare products we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical devices and surgical products we compete on many levels including price service offerings support services breadth of product lines and product quality and efficacy 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies companies that provide specialty pharmaceutical 

 

services and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers we also compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly 

in the medical segment we compete with many diversified healthcare companies and national medical product distributors such as medline industries inc owens  minor inc and becton dickinson and company as well as regional medical product distributors and companies that are focused on specific product categories we also compete with companies that distribute medical products to patients homes and thirdparty logistics companies 

employees 



at june 30 2018  we had approximately 32300 employees in the united states and approximately 17900 employees outside of the united states 

intellectual property 



we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents and continue to pursue patent protection throughout the world relating to the manufacture operation and use of various medical and surgical products to certain distribution and logistics systems to the production and distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and to other service offerings we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 

 

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 





regulatory matters 



our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon the specific business we may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements they can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products initiate product recalls seize products or impose criminal civil and administrative sanctions 

distribution 

state boards of pharmacy fda dea and various other state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal prescription drug marketing act of 1987 drug quality and security act of 2013 the “dqsa” and controlled substances act the csa the csa governs the sale packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa they must also comply with state requirements relating to controlled substances that differ from state to state 

manufacturing and marketing 

we sell our manufactured products in the united states canada europe asia and other markets the fda and other governmental agencies in the united states as well as foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing including good manufacturing practices quality systems labeling promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the products cleared or approved uses distribution importation and postmarket surveillance for most of our manufactured products in addition we need specific approval or clearance from and registrations with regulatory authorities before 

 

we can market and sell some products in the united states and certain other countries including countries in the european union eu 

in the united states authorization to commercially market a medical device is generally received in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval “pma” requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective many of our medical segment products are cleared through the 510k process and certain cordis products must be approved through the pma process   

in the eu we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives mdds and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the eu regulatory bodies finalized a new medical device regulation mdr in 2017 which replaces the existing mdds after a threeyear transition period among other things the mdr clarifies that private label distributors are deemed to be the manufacturer which will increase our regulatory obligations in the eu with respect to private label products 

it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals clearances and registrations of medical devices and they might not be granted on a timely basis if at all even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight including periodic inspection of manufacturing facilities by fda and other regulatory authorities both in the united states and internationally 

from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action which may include recalling the product correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers 

health and personal information practices 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information the us health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and state laws regulate the use and disclosure of patientidentifiable health information including requiring specified privacy and security measures we also collect handle and maintain other sensitive personal and financial information that is subject to us federal and state laws protecting such information 

the processing and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate in europe for example we are subject to the eu data protection regulations including the current eu directive on data protection which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection use 





and transfer of personal data the eu general data protection regulation gdpr includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 

our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities including for xofigo require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the nrc applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate including pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices in addition our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities also must comply with fda regulations including good manufacturing practices 

product tracing and supply chain integrity 

title ii of the dqsa known as the drug supply chain security act or track and trace establishes a phasedin national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs the first phase of implementation began in 2015 and upon full implementation in 2023 we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug tracing system in addition the fda also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier these regulations are being phased in through 2020 the mdr finalized in the eu in 2017 also introduces a new unique device identifier requirement with a threeyear transition period 

government healthcare programs 

we are subject to us federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws these laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order recommend or purchase products or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded healthcare programs they also prohibit submitting any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government there are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to medicaid and other statefunded healthcare programs violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare 

 

programs such as state medicaid programs and the federal 340b drug pricing program these businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations including applicable reporting billing payment and recordkeeping requirements other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our us federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of these laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

environmental health and safety laws 

in the united states and other countries we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

laws relating to foreign trade and operations 

us and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 

similarly we are subject to us and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws among other things these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 





other information   

although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers

risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic in addition competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical distribution may be increased by new business models new entrants new regulations or changes in consumer demand our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors which adversely affects our margins if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program may continue to be adversely affected by pricing changes and fewer product launches 

the performance of our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program declined in fiscal 2018 and 2017 and is expected to decline in fiscal 2019 the decline has been due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing deflation and less benefit from new generic pharmaceutical launches which have more than offset the benefits from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs if we continue to be unable to offset this decline our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will continue to be adversely affected 

the extent and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical pricing changes is uncertain in future fiscal years and may vary from what we anticipate similarly the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches also varies from year to year and the margin impact of these launches varies from product to product finally the benefit from red oak sourcing could be less than we anticipate 

cvs is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs accounted for 25 percent of our fiscal 2018 revenue and 22 percent of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2018 our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with cvs expire in june 2019 if cvs does not renew our agreements renews our agreements at a reduced price or significantly reduces its purchases from us our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

changes in manufacturer approaches to pricing branded pharmaceutical products could have an adverse effect on our pharmaceutical segment’s margins 

our compensation under contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is set as a percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to 

 

our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost 

in recent years pharmaceutical manufacturers have generally increased the wholesale acquisition cost of their branded pharmaceuticals each year in may 2018 the us government announced plans to among other things adopt policies to encourage manufacturers to limit increases in or reduce wholesale acquisition cost if manufacturers change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings could be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s margins under a limited number of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are affected by prices established by the manufacturers 

our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them under a limited number of agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation which is determined by the manufacturers currently also serves as a part of our compensation if manufacturers decide not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our margins could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

as described in greater detail in the business section our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits product registrations licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies for example as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances we must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa failure to maintain or renew necessary permits product registrations licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

products that we manufacture source distribute or market must comply with regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product bans recalls or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions which in turn could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device and 





such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information regulations currently in place continue to evolve and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect handle and maintain personal or patient information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations violations of federal state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties breach of contract claims costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations and it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs such sanctions and damages could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs such as state medicaid program and the federal 340b drug pricing program in addition other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 

 

the tax act was enacted in december 2017 the tax act among other things reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and required companies to pay a onetime tax to repatriate for us purposes earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred for tax purposes in addition beginning in our fiscal year 2019 the tax act limits certain deductions and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings while we generally expect the impact of the tax act to be positive it is possible that the limitation of certain deductions and the creation of new taxes could be more detrimental to us than anticipated 

from time to time initiatives are proposed in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate or tax payments specific initiatives that may impact us include the repeal of the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes the establishment or increase in taxation at the us state level on the basis of gross revenues recommendations of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission’s investigation into illegal state aid 

tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

changes to the us healthcare environment may not be favorable to us 

in recent years the us healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and patient outcomes contain costs and increase efficiencies these changes include adoption of the patient protection and affordable care act a general decline in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers the basis for payments beginning to transition from a feeforservice model to valuebased payments and risksharing models and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics physician offices and patients’ homes 

we expect the us healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future possible changes include repeal and replacement of major parts of the patient protection and affordable care act further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits these possible changes and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services which could adversely affect us 





our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems critical facilities and distribution networks our business could be adversely affected if we experience a cyberattack or other systems breach 

we rely on our and thirdparty service providers information systems for a wide variety of critical operations including to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center and our distribution networks our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service providers information systems critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted including disruption of access are damaged or fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic or power outage or due to cybersecurity incidents ransomware or other actions of third parties including labor strikes political unrest and terrorist attacks manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action production quality deviations safety issues or raw material shortages or defects or because a key product is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities 

from time to time our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes such as receiving and processing customer orders customer service and accounts payable if any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to information security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition hardware software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties also may attempt to gain access to our or a service providers systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deception   any compromise of our or a service providers information systems including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability 

 

to satisfy legal requirements including those related to patientidentifiable health information and the new eu general data protection regulation gdpr 

consolidation in the us healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations 

in recent years us healthcare industry participants including distributors manufacturers healthcare providers insurers and pharmacy chains have consolidated or formed strategic alliances consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents if this consolidation trend continues it could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our business which includes the distribution of controlled substances and the manufacture of medical products we may from time to time become involved in disputes litigation and regulatory matters litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

for example we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described below in the risk factor titled the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication could negatively affect our business and in note 9  to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims for example we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava ivc filter products we have accrued an amount for losses and legal defense costs related to these lawsuits which are discussed in note 9  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements any settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim that is not covered by insurance and is in excess of any prior accruals could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication could negatively affect our business 

our pharmaceutical segment distributes prescription opioid pain medications in recent years the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication has received heightened public attention these developments heighten a number of risks that we face and may present new risks that could adversely affect our operations or financial condition 





a significant number of counties municipalities and other plaintiffs including a number of state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmaceutical wholesale distributors including us retail chains and others relating to the manufacturing marketing or distribution of prescription opioid pain medications in addition we are currently being investigated by about 40 other states for the same activities and may be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits in the future we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business see note 9  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these matters 

other legislative regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example in april 2018 the state of new york created an aggregate 100 million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in new york in addition legislation has been proposed in some states that if enacted could require distributors to pay taxes on the distribution of opioid medications in those states these proposed bills vary in the tax amounts and the means of calculation liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted 

unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits investigations regulations and legislative actions discussed above could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our ability to manage and complete acquisitions and divestitures could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses in fiscal 2018 we spent 61 billion to acquire other businesses including in july 2017 the acquisition of the patient recovery business from medtronic for 61 billion and divested our china distribution business as well as our majority interest in navihealth 

the acquisition of the patient recovery business as well as other acquisitions involve the following risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management’s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties or delays establishing integrating or combining operations and systems we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers 

 

of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we could also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our results of operations could be greater than anticipated 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials and energy supplied by others for our operations in some instances for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural disasters or could be terminated in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials a sustained supply reduction or interruption and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins pulp cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a customer that has a substantial amount owed to us 

most of our customers buy products and services from us on credit which is made available to customers based on our assessment of creditworthiness the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could adversely affect our results of operations 

as a result of our international operations we have exposure to economic political and currency risks including changes in tariffs 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including europe asia and latin america global developments can affect our business in many ways our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and competition additionally divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets also can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

changes or uncertainty in us or foreign policy including any changes or uncertainty with respect to us or international trade 





policies or tariffs also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase 

in addition we conduct our business in us dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results which are reported in us dollars we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures 

our goodwill may be further impaired which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us gaap requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist this year as a result of the required annual test we have 

 

recorded a 14 billion impairment to goodwill within our medical segment the testing required by gaap involves estimates and judgments by management although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate any changes in key assumptions including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates in addition to the impairment to goodwill in our medical segment it is possible that we may record significant charges related to other business units or we may record additional charges in our medical segment which charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates in mda above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing

consolidated results 

fiscal 2018  overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2018  was 1368 billion  a 5 percent  increase from the prior year due primarily to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty pharmaceutical customers the patient recovery business acquisition also contributed to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2018 

gaap and nongaap operating earnings 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2018  gaap operating earnings decreased 94 percent  to 126 million  and nongaap operating earnings decreased 7 percent  to 26 billion  

the decrease in gaap operating earnings was primarily due to a noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our medical segment increased amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets as a result of the patient recovery business acquisition contract termination restructuring costs to transition the distribution of our medical segments surgeon gloves in certain international markets from a thirdparty distribution arrangement to a direct distribution model performance from cardinal health brand products primarily cordis performance from our pharmaceutical segment generics program litigation charges associated with inferior vena cava ivc filter product liability claims and the adverse impact of pharmaceutical customer contract renewals these factors were partially offset by contributions from the patient recovery business acquisition 

the decrease in nongaap operating earnings was primarily due to performance from cardinal health brand products primarily cordis performance from our pharmaceutical segment generics program and the adverse impact of pharmaceutical customer contract renewals these factors were partially offset by contributions from the patient recovery business acquisition 





gaap and nongaap diluted eps 

the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2018  gaap diluted earnings per share attributable to cardinal health inc diluted eps decreased 80 percent  to 081  and nongaap diluted eps decreased 7 percent  to 500  

fiscal 2018 gaap diluted eps decreased primarily due to the factors impacting gaap operating earnings and increased interest expense these were partially offset by the net benefit from the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act which includes a provisional transitional tax benefit of 936 million  as well as the benefit from applying a lower federal tax rate to our us pretax earnings 

fiscal 2018 nongaap diluted eps decreased primarily due to the factors impacting nongaap operating earnings and an increase in interest expense partially offset by the benefit of applying a lower us federal statutory tax rate under the tax act to us pretax nongaap earnings 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 18 billion  at june 30 2018  compared to 69 billion  at june 30 2017  the decrease in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2018  was due to 61 billion  paid for acquisitions 954 million  paid for debt repayments 581 million paid in dividends 550 million paid for share repurchases and 384 million  paid for capital expenditures these cash decreases were offset in part by 28 billion  of net cash provided by operating activities and 861 million  of cash proceeds from the sale of our china distribution business 





significant developments in fiscal 2018  and trends 

acquisitions and divestitures 



patient recovery business acquisition 

on july 29 2017 we acquired the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses the patient recovery business from medtronic plc for 61 billion in cash the acquisition further expanded the medical segments portfolio of cardinal health brand products 

china distribution business divestiture 

during fiscal 2018 we completed the divestiture of our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in china the china distribution business to shanghai pharmaceuticals holding co ltd for proceeds of 861 million after adjusting for third party indebtedness and preliminary transaction adjustments the proceeds are not reflective of tax obligations due in connection with the sale for which we have recorded a liability of 59 million  we recognized a pretax loss of 41 million related to this divestiture 

navihealth divestiture 

in june 2018 we signed a securities purchase agreement and a contribution and rollover agreement with investor entities controlled by clayton dubilier  rice cdr to sell our ownership interest in navihealth for proceeds of 736 million  after adjusting for certain fees and expenses and a 44  equity interest in a partnership that owns navihealth we also have certain call rights to reacquire navihealth we do not expect a cash tax impact from this transaction because the capital gain will be offset by capital loss carryforwards  the transaction closed on august 1 2018 we expect to record a pretax gain of more than 500 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

trends 



within our pharmaceutical segment we expect fiscal 2019 segment profit to be less than our fiscal 2018 segment profit due to the adverse impact of customer contract renewals generics program performance and the previously announced loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer our generics program performance includes the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes partially offset by the benefits of red oak sourcing as is generally the case the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of pharmaceutical customer pricing changes and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain and their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2019 could be more or less than we expect 

the acquisition of the patient recovery business increased medical segment revenue and profit during fiscal 2018 we expect the acquisition to increase medical segment profit further during fiscal 2019 due to the one additional month of results and the fiscal 2018 negative impact of the inventory fair value step up we also expect the acquisition will increase amortization and acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2019 due to the size and complexity of the acquisition 

the performance of our cordis business within our medical segment declined significantly due to inventory challenges and increased operating costs in fiscal 2018 we expect cordis performance to stabilize in fiscal 2019 

in early fiscal 2019 we implemented certain enterprisewide costsaving measures which we expect to reduce our future operating expenses 

tax cuts and jobs act 

the tax act was enacted in december 2017 the tax act among other things reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and required companies to pay a onetime tax to repatriate for us purposes earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred for tax purposes the rate change was effective at the beginning of calendar year 2018 and the application of the lower federal tax rate to our us pretax earnings resulted in a significant favorable impact to our tax provision in fiscal 2018 additionally we recognized a 936 million provisional net transitional tax benefit during fiscal 2018 consisting of the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower tax rate partially offset by the expense for the repatriation tax we expect the lower federal statutory rate to be more beneficial in fiscal 2019 than in 2018 however beginning in fiscal 2019 the tax act limits certain deductions and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings which will offset some of the additional benefit 

we are still completing our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act because all of the necessary information is not currently available prepared or analyzed as such the amounts we have recorded are provisional estimates and as permitted by the sec we will continue to assess the impact of enactment of the tax act and we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts during the first half of fiscal 2019 





results of operations 

revenue 





fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2018  pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty pharmaceutical customers which together increased revenue by 94 billion the increases were partially offset by the previously announced may 2017 expiration of a large pharmaceutical distribution mail order customer contract and the february 2018 divestiture of our china distribution business 

medical segment 

fiscal 2018  medical segment revenue grew mainly due to 19 billion of contributions from acquisitions which primarily consists of the patient recovery business acquisition 

 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2017   pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from the addition of optumrx and from other pharmaceutical distribution customers including branded pharmaceutical price appreciation all of which increased revenue by 70 billion 

medical segment 

fiscal 2017  medical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from new and existing customers and 212 million in contributions from acquisitions 

cost of products sold 



cost of products sold f or fiscal 2018 and 2017  increased 62 billion   5 percent  and 84 billion   7 percent  compared to the prioryear periods respectively as a result of the same factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin 

 





gross margin 





fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017   

fiscal 2018  consolidated gross margin increased 637 million  10 percent  and was favorably impacted by acquisitions 809 million which primarily consists of the patient recovery business acquisition 

gross margin rate grew during fiscal 2018  mainly due to acquisitions which primarily consists of the patient recovery business acquisition gross margin rate growth was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in pharmaceutical distribution product mix and performance in our cordis business due to inventory challenges and increased manufacturing costs 

 

fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016   

fiscal 2017   consolidated gross margin was essentially flat versus the prioryear period 

consolidated gross margin for fiscal   2017  was positively impacted by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers 260 million and acquisitions in both segments 132 million and was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer 

gross margin rate contracted during fiscal 2017  primarily due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes partially offset by the benefits from red oak sourcing within our pharmaceutical segment generics program 

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





               

  

fiscal   2018   compared to fiscal   2017   

fiscal 2018  sga expenses increased mainly due to acquisitions 524 million which primarily consists of the patient recovery business acquisition and enterprisewide compensation related items 

 

fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016   

fiscal 2017  sga expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions 112 million and costs related to a multiyear project to replace certain pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems partially offset by reduced enterprisewide incentive compensation 





segment profit 



we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit among other measures see note 16  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 



fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2018  pharmaceutical segment profit decreased largely due to our generics program performance and the adverse impact of customer contract renewals our generics program performance includes the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes partially offset by the benefits of red oak sourcing performance from our specialty pharmaceutical products distribution and services business positively impacted pharmaceutical segment profit 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2018  medical segment profit increased largely due to acquisitions inclusive of the unfavorable cost of products sold impact from the fair value step up of inventory acquired with the patient recovery business acquisition the increase was partially offset by  performance from the cordis business and to a lesser extent performance from other cardinal health brand products the performance from the cordis business primarily reflects inventory challenges and increased operating costs 

corporate 

the changes in corporate during fiscal 2018  are due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earnings section that follows 

 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2017   pharmaceutical segment profit decreased largely due to our generic program performance the previously disclosed loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer the adverse impact of customer contract renewals and reduced levels of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation also contributed to the decrease in pharmaceutical segment profit 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2017   medical segment profit increased due to strong performance  from navihealth contributions from cardinal health branded products reduced enterprisewide incentive compensation and contributions from distribution services cardinal health branded products growth includes the prior year unfavorable impact on cost of products sold from the cordis inventory fair value step up 

corporate 

the changes in corporate during fiscal 2017  are due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earnings section that follows 





other components of consolidated operating earnings 



in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed previously consolidated operating earnings were impacted by the following 



restructuring and employee severance 

the increase in restructuring and employee severance during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to 125 million in contract termination costs to transition the distribution of our medical segments surgeon gloves in certain international markets from a thirdparty distribution arrangement to a direct distribution model 

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 574 million 395 million and 355 million for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets during fiscal 2018  was largely due to the patient recovery business acquisition 

transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the patient recovery business were 109 million  and 54 million during fiscal 2018  and 2017 respectively 

 

impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets net 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recognized a 14 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our medical segment as discussed further in note 5  of the notes to consolidated financial statements there was no tax benefit related to this goodwill impairment charge 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

the increases in litigation charges during fiscal 2018 and 2017 were due to an increase in estimated losses and legal defense costs associated with inferior vena cava ivc filter product liability claims 

during fiscal 2016  we received and recognized income of 80 million  from settlements of class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member 

earningsloss before income taxes 



in addition to the items discussed above earningsloss before income taxes was impacted by the following 



interest expense net 

fiscal 2018 interest expense increased primarily due to new debt issued in june 2017 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the patient recovery business acquisition 





provision for income taxes 



generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the distribution of income among taxing jurisdictions with differing income tax rates and other reconciling items 

the fluctuations in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 are primarily due to net benefits from the enactment of the tax act the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges an increase in valuation allowances and a benefit from a capital loss due to international legal entity reorganization the significant increase in valuation allowances were related to capital losses credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards in us federal us state and international jurisdictions that will not likely be realized a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 



 fiscal 2018   



the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate was impacted by various items including benefits from the enactment of the tax act the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges changes in valuation allowances and a benefit from a capital loss due to an international legal entity reorganization 

the net benefit from the tax act for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional net tax benefit of 977 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new federal statutory rate the benefit from the impact of applying a lower federal tax rate to our yeartodate us pretax earnings and a provisional tax expense of 41 million for the onetime repatriation tax applied to our undistributed foreign earnings 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 also includes 59 million of tax expense recognized in connection with the sale of our china distribution business 

ongoing audits 

the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2008 through 2014 

 

fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016   



the fiscal 2017 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the realignment of foreign subsidiaries in anticipation of closing the acquisition of the patient recovery business and also from deductions related to us production activities the state and local income tax rate decreased primarily due to resolutions with state taxing authorities 

the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the state and local income tax rate which decreased due to resolutions with state taxing authorities and a shift in the distribution of income among jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential decreased primarily due to the deferred tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2015 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based on available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion contractual obligations tax payments and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 18 billion  at june 30 2018  compared to 69 billion  at june 30 2017  the decrease in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2018  was due to 61 billion  deployed for acquisitions during the year 954 million  used for debt repayments 581 million  paid in dividends 550 million  paid for share repurchases and 384 million  paid for capital expenditures offset in part by 28 billion  net cash provided by operating activities and 861 million  of proceeds from the divestiture of the china distribution business n et cash provided by operating activities increased by 16 billion from fiscal 2017 primarily due to working capital changes in part as a result of timing of customer and vendor payments related to the new pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems at june 30 2018  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

in august 2018 we completed the sale of our interest in navihealth to cdr and received proceeds of 736 million    after adjusting for certain fees and expenses and a 44  equity interest in a partnership that owns navihealth 

the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2017  of 45 billion was due to proceeds from a 52 billion debt issuance and 12 billion  provided by operating activities partially offset by 600 million  paid for share repurchases 577 million  paid in dividends 387 million  paid in capital expenditures and 310 million in debt repayments the 18 billion decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in working capital as a result of changes in timing of customer and vendor payments some of which related to implementation of the new pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems 

 

the decrease in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2016 of 22 billion was due to 36 billion  deployed for acquisitions 651 million  paid for share repurchases 512 million  paid in dividends and 465 million  paid in capital expenditures partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of 30 billion  which was positively impacted by increased net earnings and working capital improvements 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2018  included 557 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states though our foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 have been deemed to be repatriated from a us federal tax perspective we have not yet completed our assessment of the tax act on our plans to reinvest foreign earnings and as such have not changed our prior conclusion that the earnings are indefinitely reinvested as such no nonus taxes related to repatriation were recorded at june 30 2018  if we decide to repatriate these earnings in the future we may be subject to certain nonus taxes at that time see note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the tax act 

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

other financing arrangements and financial instruments 



credit facilities and commercial paper 

in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow other sources of liquidity at june 30 2018  include a 20 billion  commercial paper program backed by a 20 billion  revolving credit facility we also have a 10 billion  committed receivables sales facility program at june 30 2018  we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility program under our commercial paper and committed receivables 

 

programs we had maximum amounts outstanding of 17 billion  and an average daily amount outstanding of 277 million  during fiscal 2018 our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility programs require us to maintain as of the end of any calendar quarter a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 425to1  which will reduce to 325to1 in march 2019 as of june 30 2018  we were in compliance with this financial covenant 





longterm obligations 

in june 2018 we repaid our 550 million  195 notes due 2018 in full at maturity at june 30 2018  we had total longterm obligations of 80 billion  in fiscal 2018 we sold our china distribution business including its debt which was 378 million as of june 30 2017   see note 4   of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion of this divestiture 

in june 2017 we sold 1 billion aggregate principal amount of 1948 notes due 2019 115 billion aggregate principal amount of 2616 notes due 2022 350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2022 750 million aggregate principal amount of 3079 notes due 2024 135 billion aggregate principal amount of 3410 notes due 2027 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 4368 notes due 2047 in addition to funding a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of the patient recovery business  described below in july 2017 we used a portion of the debt proceeds to redeem our 400 million 17 notes due 2018 

 

funding for acquisition of medtronics patient recovery business 

on july 29 2017  we acquired the patient recovery business from medtronic for 61 billion  in cash we funded the acquisition through 45 billion  in new longterm debt issued in june 2017 the use of existing cash and borrowings under existing credit arrangements 

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as note 1  and note 12  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

capital deployment 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were 384 million  387 million  and 465 million  respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2019  to be between 360 million and 390 million primarily for information technology projects growth projects in our core business and for integration of the acquisition of the patient recovery business 

dividends 

during fiscal 2018  we paid quarterly dividends totaling 185  per share an increase of 3 percent  from fiscal 2017  

on may 9 2018 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 04763 per share or 191 per share on an annualized basis which was paid on july 15 2018 to shareholders of record on july 2 2018 

on august 8 2018 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 04763 per share or 191 per share on an annualized basis which will be paid on october 15 2018 to shareholders of record on october 1 2018 

 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2018  we repurchased 550 million of our common shares we funded the repurchases with available cash and shortterm borrowing at june 30 2018  we  had 893 million  r emaining under our existing 10 billion share repurchase program 

on august 16 2018 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program asr to purchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  600 million  and received an initial delivery of 95 million  shares of common stock using a reference price of  5045  the program is expected to conclude in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 

during fiscal 2017 we repurchased 600 million of our common shares we funded the repurchases with available cash 

acquisition of medtronics patient recovery business 

described above under funding for acquisition of medtronics patient recovery business 





contractual obligations 

at june 30 2018  our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 





 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2018  as that term is defined in the sec rules 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 



the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts 

a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2018  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 8 million  we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2018  are appropriate 

 

at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue the following table presents information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

inventories 



a substantial portion of our inventories  56 percent  at both june 30 2018  and 2017  are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment “distribution facilities” the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend historically prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise resulting in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for inventories 

using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost 

 

we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2018  or 2017  because inventories valued at lifo were 92 million  and   46 million  higher than the average cost value at june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record a lifo reserve in fiscal 2018  and 2017  

our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of lifo or market is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 147 million  and 76 million  at june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively the increase in the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory during fiscal 2018  was driven by increased inventory reserves within our medical segment cordis business and the patient recovery acquisition 





we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific categories of inventory age and expiration dates of onhand 

 

inventory and manufacturer return policies if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 



the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date for further discussion of the business combinations accounting policy see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names patents 

 

developed technology inprocess research and development iprd and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives see note 2   of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value does not exceed the carrying amount then a quantitative test is performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component   

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions which are components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division nuclear pharmacy services division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health at home division and navihealth division “medical unit” cardinal health at home division and navihealth division 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of repo rting units qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and if necessary  the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit our qualitative evaluation considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased 

 

approaches using discount rates ranging from 85 percent  to 135 percent   we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets we also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment if a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 and with the exception of our medical unit in fiscal 2018 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as discussed further in note 5  of the notes to consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recognized a 14 billion  goodwill impairment charge related to our medical unit which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings the impairment was primarily driven by inventory and cost challenges within our cordis business which furthered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 there was no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge if the fair value of the medical unit were to decline below its carrying value in subsequent periods additional impairment would be recognized in those periods for any of our other reporting units there would not have been an impairment for fiscal 2018 if we raised the discount rate by 1 percent 





the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily iprd involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if so then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the respective assets carrying amount our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and  considers the weight of evidence and 

 

significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value both positive and negative in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 

see note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review for further discussion on the vendor reserves see note 1  of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

vendor reserves were 45 million  and 50 million  at june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively approximately 69 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2018  pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 77 percent at the end of fiscal 2017  the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations in outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of resolutions and specific vendor issues 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 

loss contingencies and selfinsurance 



we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

we also selfinsure for employee healthcare certain product liability matters auto liability property and workers compensation and maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits when available 

selfinsurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs administrative fees claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information 

 

related to each claim if available other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period 

we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate examples of such contingencies include the new york opioid stewardship act various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the cordis ivc filter lawsuits the amount of loss may differ from these estimates see note 9  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits 





provision for income taxes 



we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



 expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical 

 

merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement 

our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates see note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets for a further discussion on provision for income taxes see note 8  of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the us tax code as per the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act as enacted by the united states government on december 22 2017 although we are still completing our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act we have made reasonable estimates and recorded provisional amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the tax act which is subject to further interpretation by the internal revenue service irs see note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding the tax act 

sharebased compensation 



employee sharebased compensation is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date market price of our common shares determines the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it takes into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and postvesting forfeitures the expected life of the options granted which represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding is calculated from the option valuation model expected volatilities are based on implied volatility 

 

from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years 

forfeiture estimates for all types of awards are adjusted as circumstances change and ultimately reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates 

compensation expense for nonvested performance share units depends on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued see note 17  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation

pharmaceutical segment 



in the united states our pharmaceutical segment 

 in china the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded generic and specialty pharmaceutical overthecounter healthcare and consumer products provides logistics marketing and other services and operates directtopatient specialty pharmacies through cardinal health china in july 2017 we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the cardinal health china pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses our other 

 

medical product businesses in china including cordis and the patient recovery business  acquired from medtronic are not part of this exploration 

see note 15  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for pharmaceutical segment revenue profit and assets for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  

pharmaceutical distribution 

our pharmaceutical distribution division’s gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical program from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and from overthecounter healthcare and consumer products it also includes manufacturer cash discounts 

margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts and rebates from manufacturers and may include price appreciation on some products our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time 

margin from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers relates primarily to fees we receive for providing a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers and also to a lesser extent includes benefits from price appreciation on branded pharmaceutical products 

sourcing venture with cvs health corporation 

in july 2014 we established red oak sourcing a usbased generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with cvs with an initial term of 10 years red oak sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies 

specialty pharmaceutical products and services

see note 15  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for medical segment revenue profit and assets for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  

acquisitions 



we have acquired a number of businesses over the years that have enhanced our core strategic areas of selfmanufactured medical products generic pharmaceutical distribution and services specialty pharmaceutical products and services international and postacute care we expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 

during the last five fiscal years we completed the following three large acquisitions 



 

we have also completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years including in fiscal 2017 the acquisition of the north american rights to lymphoseek a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent from navidea biopharmaceuticals inc in fiscal 2016 the acquisition of an 82 percent ownership interest in navihealth a provider of postacute care management services and curaspan health group inc a provider of discharge planning and care transition software in fiscal 2015 the acquisitions of tradex international inc a supplier of disposable gloves and metro medical supply inc a distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical products and in fiscal 2014 the acquisition of access closure inc a manufacturer and distributor of extravascular closure devices

customers 



our largest customers cvs and optumrx accounted for 23 percent  and 11 percent of our fiscal 2017  revenue respectively in the aggregate our five largest customers including cvs and optumrx accounted for 50 percent of our fiscal 2017  revenue our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with cvs extend through june 2019 

we have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their 

 

members our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with vizient inc and premier inc sales to members of these two gpos under numerous contracts across all of our businesses collectively accounted for 21 percent  of our revenue in fiscal 2017  

suppliers 



we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 27 percent  of our revenue during fiscal 2017  but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 7 percent  of revenue 

 

competition 



we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products we compete on many levels including price service offerings support services breadth of product lines and product quality and efficacy 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies companies that provide specialty pharmaceutical services and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a 

 

number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers we also compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly 

in the medical segment our manufacturing and procedural kit businesses compete with diversified healthcare companies as well as companies that are more focused on specific product categories we also compete with many different national medical product distributors including medline industries inc and owens  minor inc regional medical product distributors companies that distribute medical products to patients homes and thirdparty logistics companies in addition we compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly 

employees 



at june 30 2017  we had approximately 28000 employees in the united states and approximately 12400 employees outside of the united states in july 2017 we added approximately 3500 employees in the united states and approximately 5900 employees 

 

outside the united states through the acquisition of the patient recovery business  overall we consider our employee relations to be good 

intellectual property 



we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents and continue to pursue patent protection throughout the world relating to the manufacture operation and use of various medical and surgical products to certain distribution and logistics systems to the production and distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and to other service offerings we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 

 

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 





regulatory matters 



our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon the specific business we may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements they can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products initiate product recalls seize products or impose criminal civil and administrative sanctions 

distribution 

the fda dea and various state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal prescription drug marketing act of 1987 drug quality and security act of 2013 the “dqsa” and controlled substances act the csa the csa governs the sale packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa 

manufacturing and marketing 

we sell our manufactured products in the united states canada europe asia and other markets the fda and other governmental agencies in the united states as well as foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing including good manufacturing practices quality systems labeling promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the products cleared or approved uses distribution importation and postmarket surveillance for most of our manufactured products in addition we need specific approval or clearance from and registrations with regulatory authorities before we can market and sell some products in the united states and certain other countries including countries in the european union eu 

in the united states authorization to commercially market a medical device is generally received in one of two ways the first known as 

 

premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval “pma” requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective many of our medical segment products are cleared through the 510k process and certain cordis products must be approved through the pma process   

in the eu we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives mdds and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the eu regulatory bodies finalized a new medical device regulation mdr in 2017 which replaces the existing mdds after a threeyear transition period among other things the mdr clarifies that private label distributors are deemed to be the manufacturer which will increase our regulatory obligations in the eu with respect to private label products 

it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals clearances and registrations of medical devices and they might not be granted on a timely basis if at all even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight including periodic inspection of manufacturing facilities by fda and other regulatory authorities both in the united states and internationally 

from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action which may include recalling the product correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 

our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities including for xofigo require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the nrc applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate including pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices in addition our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities also must comply with fda regulations including good manufacturing practices 

product tracing and supply chain integrity 

title ii of the dqsa known as the drug supply chain security act establishes a phasedin national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs the first phase of implementation began in 2015 and upon full implementation in 2023 we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug tracing system in addition the fda also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier these regulations are being phased in through 2020 the 





mdr finalized in the eu in 2017 also introduces a new unique device identifier requirement with a threeyear transition period 

government healthcare programs 

we are subject to us federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws these laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order recommend or purchase products or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded healthcare programs they also prohibit submitting any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government there are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to medicaid and other statefunded healthcare programs violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs such as state medicaid programs and the federal 340b drug pricing program these businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations including applicable reporting billing payment and recordkeeping requirements other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our us federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

health and personal information practices 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information the us health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and state laws regulate the use and disclosure of patientidentifiable health information including requiring specified privacy and security 

 

measures we also collect handle and maintain other sensitive personal and financial information that is subject to us federal and state laws protecting such information 

the processing and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate in europe for example we are subject to the eu data protection regulations including the current eu directive on data protection which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection use and transfer of personal data a new eu general data protection regulation gdpr that will become effective in 2018 and will apply uniformly across the eu includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of these laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

environmental health and safety laws 

in the united states and other countries we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

laws relating to foreign trade and operations 

us and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 

similarly we are subject to us and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act chinese anticorruption laws the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws among other things these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 





other information   

although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers

see note 15  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for revenue and longlived assets by geographic area 






 



risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program could be adversely affected by pricing changes and fewer product launches 

prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time during fiscal 2017 generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes negatively impacted pharmaceutical segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings and are expected to have a similar negative effect in fiscal 2018 at times some generic pharmaceuticals may experience price appreciation which can positively affect our margins the number of generic pharmaceuticals experiencing price appreciation or declines and the magnitude of pricing changes is uncertain in future fiscal years and could adversely affect our margins 

the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches also varies from year to year and the margin impact of these launches varies from product to product fewer product launches or launches that are less profitable than prior launches could adversely affect our margins 

our generic pharmaceutical program has benefited from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs which sources for both us and cvs if the venture does not continue to be successful our margins could be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s margins under our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are affected by service fees we receive from the manufacturers and prices established by the manufacturers 

our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for the services we provide them under some agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation also serves as part of our compensation if our service fees are reduced or in cases where our compensation is based in part on branded pharmaceutical price appreciation if manufacturers determine not to increase prices or to implement only small increases our margins could be adversely affected 

 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

as described in greater detail in the business section our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits product registrations licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies for example as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances we must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa failure to maintain or renew necessary permits product registrations licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

products that we manufacture source distribute or market must comply with regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product bans recalls or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions which in turn could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations and it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs such sanctions and damages could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some businesses within each of our segments are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs such as state medicaid program and the federal 340b drug pricing program in addition other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through or are otherwise governed by federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 





our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information regulations currently in place continue to evolve and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect handle and maintain personal or patient information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations violations of federal state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties breach of contract claims costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act chinese anticorruption laws the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions 

our china operations are subject to national regional and local regulations the regulatory environment in china is evolving and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations it is possible that the chinese governments current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our china operations result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties 

cvs is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs accounted for 23 percent  of our fiscal 2017  revenue and 20 percent  of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2017  our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with cvs extend through june 2019 if cvs does not renew our agreements with them terminates the agreements due to an alleged default by us defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases from us our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 

from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate or tax payments examples of such initiatives include the repeal of the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes a change in the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations new us import tariffs or taxes the establishment or 

 

increase in taxation at the us state level on the basis of gross revenues recommendations of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission’s investigation into illegal state aid 

tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

changes to the us healthcare environment may not be favorable to us 

in recent years the us healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and patient outcomes contain costs and increase efficiencies these changes include adoption of the patient protection and affordable care act a general decline in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers the basis for payments beginning to transition from a feeforservice model to valuebased payments and risksharing models and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics physician offices and patients’ homes 

we expect the us healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future possible changes include repeal and replacement of major parts of the patient protection and affordable care act further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits these possible changes and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services which could adversely affect us 

consolidation in the us healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations 

in recent years us healthcare industry participants including distributors manufacturers healthcare providers insurers and pharmacy chains have consolidated or formed strategic alliances consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents if this consolidation trend continues it could adversely affect our results of operations   

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems critical facilities and distribution networks our business could be adversely affected if we experience a cyberattack or other systems breach 

we rely on our and thirdparty service providers information systems for a wide variety of critical operations including to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 







 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center and our distribution networks our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service providers information systems critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted including disruption of access are damaged or fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic or power outage or due to cybersecurity incidents ransomware or other actions of third parties including labor strikes political unrest and terrorist attacks manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action production quality deviations safety issues or raw material shortages or defects or because a key product is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities 

the pharmaceutical segment is in a multiyear project to replace certain of its finance and operating information systems if these new systems are not effectively implemented or they fail to operate as intended it could adversely affect the pharmaceutical segment’s supply chain operations and our internal control over financial reporting in addition from time to time other businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes such as receiving and processing customer orders customer service and accounts payable if any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to information security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition hardware software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties also may attempt to gain access to our or a service providers systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deception   any compromise of our or a service providers information systems including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements including those related to patientidentifiable health information 

we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

 

due to the nature of our business which includes the distribution of controlled substances and the manufacture of medical products we may from time to time become involved in disputes litigation and regulatory matters litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

for example a number of governmental entities including counties and municipalities have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical wholesale distributors including us pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail chains relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications some states and other governmental entities have indicated they are considering filing similar lawsuits we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the defense and resolution of these current and future lawsuits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements regarding these matters 

some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims for example we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava ivc filter products and we have accrued an amount for losses and legal defense costs related to these lawsuits which are discussed in note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements any settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim that is not covered by insurance and is in excess of any prior accruals could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

acquisitions can have unanticipated results 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses in fiscal 2017  we spent 132 million  to acquire other businesses and in july 2017 we acquired the patient recovery business  from medtronic for 61 billion  the acquisition of the patient recovery business  as well as other acquisitions involve the following risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management’s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties or delays establishing integrating or combining operations and systems we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 





we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials and energy supplied by others for our operations in some instances for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural disasters or could be terminated in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials a sustained supply reduction or interruption and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins pulp cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a customer that has a substantial amount owed to us 

most of our customers buy products and services from us on credit which is made available to customers based on our assessment of creditworthiness the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could adversely affect our results of operations 

recent acquisitions have   increased the extent of our exposure to the economic political and currency risks of international operations 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including europe and asia the scope and complexity of our international operations expanded with the acquisitions of cordis and the patient recovery business  and we may continue to expand our operations outside the united states global developments can affect our business in many ways our 

 

global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and competition in addition we conduct our business in us dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results which are reported in us dollars we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures political changes also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets also can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

our goodwill may become impaired which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us gaap requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist the testing required by gaap involves estimates and judgments by management although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate any changes in key assumptions including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined which charge could adversely affect our results of operations see critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates in mda above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing 

economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services 

deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and therefore reduce purchases of our products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition deteriorating economic conditions may increase bankruptcies insolvencies or other credit failures of customers or suppliers which if they have a substantial amount owed to us also could adversely affect our results of operations

consolidated results 

fiscal 2017  overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2017  was 1300 billion  a 7 percent  increase from the prior year due primarily to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers 

gaap and nongaap operating earnings 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2017  gaap operating earnings decreased 14 percent  to 21 billion  and nongaap operating earnings decreased 4 percent  to 28 billion  the decreases in both gaap and nongaap operating earnings were primarily due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes and the previously disclosed loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer the decreases were partially offset by the benefits of red oak sourcing within our pharmaceutical segment generics program and growth from our medical segment changes in litigation recoveriescharges net and amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets related to the acquisition of cordis also contributed to the decrease in gaap operating earnings during fiscal 2017  

 

gaap and nongaap diluted eps 

the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2017  gaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to cardinal health inc diluted eps decreased 7 percent  to 403  and nongaap diluted eps increased 3 percent  to 540  gaap diluted eps decreased due to lower gaap operating earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases nongaap diluted eps increased primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases partially offset by lower nongaap operating earnings 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 69 billion  at june 30 2017  compared to 24 billion  at june 30 2016  the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2017  was driven by the proceeds from a 52 billion debt issuance and 12 billion  provided by operating activities partially offset by 600 million  paid for share repurchases 577 million  paid in dividends 387 million  in capital expenditures and 310 million in debt repayments 

in july 2017 we used 61 billion  to fund the acquisition of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses from medtronic plc as discussed below and used 403 million to redeem our 17 notes due 2018 





significant developments in fiscal 2017  and trends 

acquisition of medtronics patient recovery business 



on july 29 2017 we acquired the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses the patient recovery business from medtronic plc medtronic for 61 billion  in cash the patient recovery business manufactures 23 medical product categories sold into multiple healthcare channels and includes numerous industryleading brands such as curity kendall dover argyle and kangaroo the acquisition further expands the medical segments portfolio of selfmanufactured products we funded the acquisition through 45 billion in new longterm debt the use of existing cash and borrowings under our existing credit arrangements  

trends 



within our pharmaceutical segment we expect fiscal 2018 segment profit to be less than our fiscal 2017 segment profit due primarily to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes which also negatively impacted pharmaceutical segment profit during fiscal 2017 however as is generally the case the frequency timing magnitude and profit impact of pharmaceutical customer pricing changes and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain and their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2018 could be more or less than we expect 

in fiscal 2018 we expect the acquisition of the patient recovery business will significantly increase the medical segments revenue and segment profit we also expect the acquisition will significantly increase amortization and acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2018 due to the size and complexity of the acquisition we expect our interest expense net to increase in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of the patient recovery business 





results of operations 

revenue 





fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2017  pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from the addition of optumrx and from other pharmaceutical distribution customers including continued branded pharmaceutical price appreciation all of which increased revenue by 70 billion 

medical segment 

fiscal 2017  medical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from new and existing customers and 212 million in contributions from acquisitions 

 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2016  ph armaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from the addition of optumrx and from other pharmaceutical distribution customers including continued branded pharmaceutical price appreciation all of which increased revenue by 169 billion acquisitions also contributed 21 billion to revenue growth 

medical segment 

fiscal 2016  medical segment revenue grew primarily due to acquisitions net of divestitures which contributed 645 million and sales growth from existing businesses 

cost of products sold 



cost of products sold f or fiscal 2017 and 2016  increased 84 billion   7 percent  and 182 billion   19 percent  compared to the prioryear periods respectively as a result of the same factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin 

 





gross margin 





fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016     

fiscal 2017  consolidated gross margin was essentially flat versus the prioryear period 

consolidated gross margin for fiscal 2017  was positively impacted by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers 260 million and acquisitions in both segments 132 million and was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer 

gross margin rate contracted during fiscal 2017  primarily due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes partially offset by the benefits from red oak sourcing within our pharmaceutical segment generics program 

 

fiscal   2016   compared to fiscal   2015   

fiscal 2016  consolidated gross margin increased 831 million   15 percent   and was favorably impacted by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers 510 million and acquisitions net of divestitures 576 million 

gross margin rate contracted during  fiscal 2016  primarily due to changes in product mix driven by the onboarding of a new mail order customer optumrx starting in october 2015 and also due to the adverse impact of customer pricing changes our gross margin rate was favorably impacted by performance under our pharmaceutical segment generics program our generics program had strong yearoveryear performance from red oak sourcing 

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016   

fiscal 2017  sga expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions 112 million and costs related to a multiyear project to replace certain pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems partially offset by reduced enterprisewide incentive compensation 

 

fiscal   2016   compared to fiscal   2015   

fiscal 2016  sga expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions net of divestitures 370 million 





segment profit 



we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit among other measures see note 15  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 



fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2017  pharmaceutical segment profit decreased largely due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes the previously disclosed loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer the adverse impact of customer repricings and reduced levels of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation also contributed to the decrease in pharmaceutical segment profit these were partially offset by the benefits of red oak sourcing within our generics program 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2017  medical segment profit increased due to strong performance  from navihealth contributions from cardinal health branded products reduced enterprisewide incentive compensation and contributions from distribution services cardinal health branded products growth includes the prior year unfavorable impact on cost of products sold from the cordis inventory fair value step up 

corporate 

as discussed further in sections that follow the principal drivers for the change in corporate during fiscal 2017  were the change in litigation recoveriescharges net and higher amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2016   pharmaceutical segment profit increased due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers and performance under our generics program partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes acquisitions also contributed to pharmaceutical segment profit growth our generics program benefited from strong yearoveryear performance from red oak sourcing 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2016   medical segment profit increased due to the contribution from cardinal health branded products acquisitions net of divestitures which included the unfavorable impact on cost of products sold from the fair value step up of inventory acquired with cordis also contributed to segment profit growth fiscal 2016  medical segment profit growth was partially offset by a decline in the results from our canada business 

corporate 

as discussed further in sections that follow the principal driver for the change in corporate in fiscal 2016   was increased amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs primarily related to the acquisitions of cordis and harvard drug partially offset by litigation recoveries 





other components of consolidated operating earnings 



in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed previously consolidated operating earnings were impacted by the following 



amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 392 million 355 million and 189 million for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets during fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  was largely due to the acquisition of cordis transaction and integration costs associated with the cordis acquisition were 61 million  and 78 million   during fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively 

transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the patient recovery business were 54 million  during fiscal 2017  

 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2017  we incurred litigation charges of 45 million due to accrued expenses relating to the cordisrelated ivc filter product liability claims and the settlement of the state of west virginia matter see note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2016  and 2015  we received and recognized income of 80 million  and 71 million respectively from settlements of class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member during fiscal 2015  we incurred litigation charges of 68 million related to government investigations 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 



in addition to the items discussed above earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was impacted by the following 



interest expense net 

fiscal 2017 interest expense increased primarily due to 52 billion of new longterm debt issued in june 2017 45 billion of which was used to fund the acquisition of the patient recovery business in july 2017 fees relating to a commitment for an unsecured bridge term loan facility obtained in connection with the acquisition also contributed to the increase in interest expense no amounts were drawn under the bridge loan facility and we terminated the commitment letter in june 2017 

 

fiscal 2016  interest expense increased primarily as a result of the additional 15 billion of debt issued in june 2015 to fund the harvard drug and cordis acquisitions 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in fiscal 2015 we redeemed certain debt resulting in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 60 million 37 million net of tax 





provision for income taxes 



the provision for income taxes decreased in fiscal 2017  primarily due to a decrease in earnings from continuing operations and a 44 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate as discussed below 

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the distribution of income among nonus taxing jurisdictions with lower income tax rates and other reconciling items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 



fiscal 2017   



the fiscal 2017 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the change in other items which decreased 35 percentage points from fiscal 2016 primarily due to the realignment of foreign subsidiaries in anticipation of closing the acquisition of the patient recovery business  and also with deductions related to us production activities the state and local income tax rate decreased 05 percentage points primarily due to resolutions with state taxing authorities 

ongoing audits 

the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2008 through 2014 

 

fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015   



the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the state and local income tax rate which decreased 26 percentage points from fiscal 2015 due to resolutions with state taxing authorities and a shift in the distribution of income among jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential decreased 18 percentage points primarily due to the deferred tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2015 

the fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the state and local income tax rate which increased 19 percentage points due to the derecognition of certain state tax benefits the foreign tax rate differential also increased 12 percentage points primarily due to recognition of deferred tax benefits resulting from new tax legislation in addition the change in measurement of uncertain tax positions increased 13 percentage points primarily as a result of proposed assessment of additional tax 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based on available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion contractual obligations tax payments and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 69 billion  at june 30 2017  compared to 24 billion  at june 30 2016  the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2017  was driven by the proceeds from the 52 billion debt issuance and 12 billion  provided by operating activities partially offset by 600 million  paid for share repurchases 577 million  paid in dividends 387 million  in capital expenditures and 310 million in debt repayments the 18 billion decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in working capital as a result of changes in timing of customer and vendor payments some of which related to implementation of the new pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems at june 30 2017  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments on july 29 2017 we acquired the patient recovery business for 61 billion  in cash 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2017  included 569 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of cash is available for repatriation bringing the cash into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations because the earnings are considered permanently reinvested no us tax provision has been 

 

accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings it is not practicable to evaluate the amount of us tax that might be payable on the remittance of such earnings 

the decrease in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2016  of 22 billion was driven by 36 billion  deployed for acquisitions 651 million  paid for share repurchases 512 million  paid in dividends and 465 million in capital expenditures partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of 30 billion  which was positively impacted by increased net earnings and working capital improvements 

during fiscal 2015  we deployed 10 billion  of cash on share repurchases 503 million  on acquisitions and 460 million  on dividends net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion  benefited from a net working capital decrease in excess of 500 million as a result of the walgreens contract expiration 

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

other financing arrangements and financial instruments 



credit facilities and commercial paper 

in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow other sources of liquidity at june 30 2017  include a 175 billion  revolving credit facility and a 700 million  committed receivables sales facility program we also have a 175 billion commercial paper program backed by our revolving credit facility at june 30 2017  we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility program under our commercial paper program we had a maximum amount outstanding of 855 million  and an average daily amount outstanding of 58 million  during fiscal 2017 

our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility programs require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1 as of the last day of each quarter as a result of the acquisition of the patient recovery business  we temporarily 

 

increased this ratio to 425to1 as of june 30 2017  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

longterm obligations 

at june 30 2017  we had total longterm obligations of 91 billion  

in june 2017 we sold 1 billion aggregate principal amount of 1948 notes due 2019 115 billion aggregate principal amount of 2616 notes due 2022 350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2022 750 million aggregate principal amount of 3079 notes due 2024 135 billion aggregate principal amount of 3410 notes due 2027 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 4368 notes due 2047 in addition to funding a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of the patient recovery business  described below in july 2017 we used a portion of the debt proceeds to redeem our 400 million 17 notes due 2018 





funding for acquisition of medtronics patient recovery business 

on july 29 2017  we acquired the patient recovery business from medtronic for 61 billion  in cash we funded the acquisition using 45 billion  of the proceeds from longterm debt issued in june 2017 cash on hand 400 million in commercial paper and 300 million borrowed under our receivables sales facility the new longterm debt was issued in june 2017 primarily to fund a portion of the purchase price of this acquisition we also had obtained a commitment letter in april 2017 from a financial institution for a 45 billion unsecured bridge term loan facility that could have been used to complete the acquisition we incurred fees related to the facility which are included in interest expense net no amounts were drawn under the bridge term loan facility and we terminated the commitment letter in june 2017 

 

availableforsale securities 

at june 30 2017  and 2016  we held 65 million  and 200 million  respectively of marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale in july 2017 we liquidated 65 million  of our marketable securities 

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as note 1  and note 11  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

capital deployment 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were 387 million  465 million  and 300 million  respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2018  to be between 500 million and 540 million primarily for information technology projects growth projects in our core business and for integration of the acquisition of the patient recovery business 

dividends 

during fiscal 2017  we paid quarterly dividends totaling 180  per share an increase of 16 percent  from fiscal 2016  

on may 3 2017 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 04624 per share or 185 per share on an annualized basis which was paid on july 15 2017 to shareholders of record on july 3 2017 

 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2017 we repurchased 600 million of our common shares we funded the repurchases with available cash at june 30 2017 we had 443 million remaining under our existing 10 billion share repurchase program 

acquisition of medtronics patient recovery business 

described above under funding for acquisition of medtronics patient recovery business 

longterm obligations repayment plans 

we plan to reduce our longterm obligations by approximately 500 million in each of fiscal 2018 2019 and 2020 by paying off longterm debt as it comes due 





contractual obligations 

at june 30 2017  our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 





 

table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflows see note 7  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion of income taxes additionally the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests are excluded from the table as the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the redemption amount are uncertain see note 1  and note 12  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2017  as that term is defined in the sec rules 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 



the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts 

a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2017  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 8 million  we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2017  are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings 

 

or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue 

the following table presents information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



inventories 



a substantial portion of our inventories  56 percent  and 58 percent  at june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment “distribution facilities” the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend prices for branded pharmaceuticals generally tend to rise resulting in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information on our policy for inventories 

using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost 

 

we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2017  or 2016  because inventories valued at lifo were 46 million  and   9 million  higher than the average cost value at june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2017  and 2016  

our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of lifo or market is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 76 million  and 79 million  at june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific categories of inventory age of onhand inventory and manufacturer return policies if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 





business combinations 



the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date for further discussion of the business combinations accounting policy see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names patents 

 

developed technology inprocess research and development iprd and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives see note 2   of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health at home division and navihealth division “medical unit” cardinal health at home division and navihealth division 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units and the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment if a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period 

 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our annual impairment test in fiscal 2017 the fair value of our medical unit exceeded its carrying value of 68 billion by approximately 6 percent which is lower than in past years due to recent performance of our cordis acquisition for this test we used a discount rate of 85 percent and a terminal growth rate of 20 percent the goodwill balance for our medical unit is 26 billion a decrease in future cash flows an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate among other things could result in a goodwill impairment for the medical unit if we were to alter our impairment testing in fiscal 2017 by increasing the discount rate by 10 percent there would have been an impairment indicator for our medical unit and we would have performed step 2 of the goodwill impairment test similarly changes in other key assumptions used in the test could result in an impairment indicator for our medical unit for any of our other reporting units there would not have been an impairment indicator for fiscal 2017 if we raised the discount rate by 10 percent subsequent to june 30 2017 we acquired the patient recovery business as discussed in note 18  which will be included in the medical unit going forward and is expected to significantly contribute to the profit of this unit 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using a combination of straightline and accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the asset over their estimated useful lives we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily iprd requires comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date 

we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which we   believe   are consistent with those of a market participant and include an   estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for the indefinitelived intangible including among other factors assumptions on regulatory approval for iprd 





determining whether an impairment of indefinitelived intangibles occurred requires estimating future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts 

 

see note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review for further discussion on the vendor reserves see note 1  of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

vendor reserves were 50 million  and 62 million  at june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively approximately 77 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2017  pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 66 percent at the end of fiscal 2016  the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations in outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of resolutions and specific vendor issues 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 

loss contingencies and selfinsurance 



we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 

because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

we also selfinsure for employee healthcare certain product liability matters auto liability property and workers compensation and maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits when available 

selfinsurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs administrative fees claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 

 

for certain types of exposures we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim if available other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period 

we regularly review contingencies and selfinsurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of loss may differ from these estimates see note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits 





provision for income taxes 



our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



 expiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued for a further discussion on provision for income taxes see note 1  of the “notes to the consolidated financial statements” 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective income tax rate by 1 percent would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease 19 million  for fiscal 2017  see note 7  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

sharebased compensation 



employee sharebased compensation is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date market price of our common shares determines the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it takes into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and postvesting forfeitures to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted which represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding 

 

is calculated from the option valuation model expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten yearsthe forfeiture estimates are adjusted as circumstances change and ultimately reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates compensation expense for nonvested performance share units depends on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued see note 16  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation 





explanation and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures

suppliers 



we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 27 percent  of our revenue during fiscal 2016  but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 8 percent  of revenue 

 

competition 



we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products we compete on many levels including price service offerings support services and breadth of product lines 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies companies that provide specialty pharmaceutical services and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a 

 

number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers we also compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly 

in the medical segment we compete with many different national medical product distributors including owens  minor inc medline industries inc and mckesson corporation we also compete with regional medical product distributors and companies that distribute medical products to patients in the home as well as thirdparty logistics companies in addition we compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly competitors of the medical segment’s manufacturing and procedural kit businesses include diversified healthcare companies as well as companies that are more focused on specific product categories 

employees 



at june 30 2016  we had approximately 26500 employees in the united states and approximately 10800 employees outside of the united states overall we consider our employee relations to be good 

 

intellectual property 



we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents relating to medical and surgical products and to distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 

 

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 





regulatory matters 



our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon their specific business our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements they can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products initiate product recalls seize products or impose criminal civil and administrative sanctions 

distribution 

the fda dea and various state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal prescription drug marketing act of 1987 drug quality and security act of 2013 the “dqsa” and controlled substances act the csa the csa governs the sale packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa 

manufacturing and marketing 

the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing including good manufacturing practices quality systems labeling promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the uses set forth in the approved product label distribution importation and postmarket surveillance of most of our manufactured products in addition we need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities and may have to register products with regulatory authorities before we can market and sell some of these products in the united states and certain other countries 

 

in the united states authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device is generally received in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval “pma” requires us to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective and is much more detailed than the 510k process many of our medical segment products are cleared through the 510k process and certain cordis products must be approved through the pma process it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals clearances and registrations of medical devices and such approvals clearances and registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight 

from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action which may include recalling the product correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 

our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the nrc applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate in addition our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities must comply with the fdas good manufacturing practices once completed our sterile radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility also will be subject to nrc and fda regulation changes to pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices are being considered by the fda state boards of pharmacy and standards setting organizations   that may affect our nuclear pharmacy services division and could require additional infrastructure requirements and modifications to our current practices and impose additional costs 

product tracing and supply chain integrity 

title ii of the dqsa known as the drug supply chain security act establishes a phasedin national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs the first phase of implementation began on january 1 2015 and upon full implementation in 2023 we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug tracing system in addition the fda also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier these regulations are being phased in through 2020 





government healthcare programs 

we are subject to us federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws these laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order or purchase items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded healthcare programs they also prohibit submitting or causing to be submitted any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government there are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to medicaid and other statefunded healthcare programs violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments 

our cardinal health at home business and a few of our other businesses are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in state medicaid programs these businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations including applicable billing payment and recordkeeping requirements in addition we manufacture pharmaceutical and medical products and repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased through federal or state healthcare programs and are subject to laws that establish eligibility for reimbursement by federal and state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

in addition our us federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

health and personal information practices 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act as well as some state and foreign laws regulate the use and disclosure of patientidentifiable health information including requiring specified privacy and security measures 

we also collect handle and maintain other sensitive personal and financial information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 

in europe we are subject to the european union “eu” data protection regulations including the eu directive on data protection which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection use and transfer of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states a new eu general data protection regulation that will apply uniformly 

 

across the eu will become effective in 2018 and includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages as previously disclosed in april 2015 we settled allegations by the ftc resulting from an investigation into supplier arrangements involving our nuclear pharmacy services division primarily focused on the period between 2003 and 2008 

environmental health and safety laws 

in the united states and other countries we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

laws relating to foreign trade and operations 

us and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 

similarly we are subject to us and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act chinese anticorruption laws the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws among other things these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 





other information 



although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers

risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s generic pharmaceutical program could be adversely affected by price declines and fewer generic product launches 

prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time although some generic products may experience price appreciation which can positively affect our margins we may not be able to predict whether and if so for how long and at what magnitude such price appreciation will be sustained the number of generic products experiencing price declines or appreciation and the magnitude of price changes is uncertain in future fiscal years and could have a negative impact on our yearoveryear margins 

the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches also varies from year to year and the margin impact of these launches varies from product to product fewer generic product launches or launches that are less profitable than prior launches will have an adverse effect on our yearoveryear margin growth 

our generic pharmaceutical program has benefited from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs health which sources for both us and cvs health if the venture does not continue to be successful our margins could be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical segment’s margins under our distribution agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are affected by service fees we receive from the manufacturers and prices established by the manufacturers 

our distribution agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for the services we provide them under some agreements branded pharmaceutical price appreciation also serves as part of our compensation if our service fees are reduced or in cases where part of our compensation is branded price appreciation if manufacturers determine not to increase prices or to implement only modest increases our margins may be adversely affected 

 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

as described in greater detail in the business section our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits product registrations licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies failure to maintain or renew necessary permits product registrations licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

products that we manufacture source distribute or market must comply with regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product bans recalls or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions which in turn could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations and it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs such sanctions and damages could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our cardinal health at home business and a few of our other businesses are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in state medicaid programs in addition we manufacture pharmaceutical and medical products and repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased through federal or state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 





we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information regulations currently in place continue to evolve and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect handle and maintain personal or patient information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations violations of federal state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties breach of contract claims costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act chinese anticorruption laws the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions 

our china operations are subject to national regional and local regulations the regulatory environment in china is evolving and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations it is possible that the chinese governments current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our china operations result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties 

the acquisition of cordis significantly expanded the number of countries in which we sell products directly we are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of each of these countries including requirements related to product registrations and licensing of medical devices additionally as a result of the cordis acquisition we now manufacture and distribute a greater number of products that are implanted in the human body subjecting us to more complex regulations within the united states and in the foreign countries in which cordis operates if we fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions 

cvs health is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs health accounted for 25 percent  of our fiscal 2016  revenue and 22 percent  of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2016  if cvs health were to terminate our agreements with them due to an alleged default by us default in payment or significantly reduce its purchases of our products and services our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 

from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition examples of such initiatives include the repeal of the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes a change in the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations the establishment or increase in taxation at the us state level on the basis of gross revenues recommendations of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission’s investigation into illegal state aid 

tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition 

the us healthcare environment is changing in many ways some of which may not be favorable to us 

the us healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and patient outcomes contain costs and increase efficiencies medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have generally declined and the basis for payments is changing shifting away from the traditional feeforservice model towards valuebased payments and risksharing models the us department of health and human services has set a goal of tying 50 percent of medicare reimbursements to alternative payment models by the end of 2018 the use of managed care has increased distributors manufacturers healthcare providers insurers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and have formed strategic alliances large purchasing groups are also prevalent the industry is experiencing a shift away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics and physician offices and in some cases patients’ homes we could be adversely affected directly or indirectly if our customers or suppliers are adversely affected by these and other changes in the delivery pricing or utilization of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical products or healthcare services 

consolidation in the healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations 

in recent years the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate manufacturers are combining which may leave us less able to negotiate our service fees with them some of our customers also are consolidating creating larger enterprises with greater negotiating power customer consolidations also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents we expect this consolidation trend among manufacturers and customers to continue which could adversely affect our results of operations   





our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems critical facilities and distribution networks our business could be adversely affected if we experience a cyberattack or other systems breach 

we rely on our information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center and our distribution networks our results of operations could be adversely affected if 

 whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic or power outage or due to cyber security incidents or other actions of third parties including terrorism or labor strikes 

the pharmaceutical segment is in a multiyear project to replace certain of its finance and operating information systems if these new systems are not effectively implemented or they fail to operate as intended it could adversely affect the pharmaceutical segment’s supply chain operations and our internal control over financial reporting in addition from time to time other businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or may use thirdparty service providers for key systems and processes such as order to cash customer service and accounts payable if any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to information security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information 

 

security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or to those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees contractors or vendors any compromise of our information systems or of the information systems of a thirdparty with whom we do business including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements including those legal requirements related to patientidentifiable health information 

because of the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings these include commercial disputes government contract compliance matters product liability claims or lawsuits patent infringement claims qui tam  actions or other legal proceedings 

some of the products that we manufacture or distribute including the cardiovascular and endovascular products manufactured and distributed by cordis have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims although we maintain product liability insurance for many products that we manufacture there are substantial selfinsured retentions conditions or exclusions there are no guarantees that we can obtain product liability insurance for a particular product we manufacture or if we do obtain insurance the amount maintained would be adequate to cover any or all current or future claims settlements or judgments where we selfinsure we establish reserves based on actuarial methodologies and historical loss trends however any settlement or judgment in excess of our insurance limits or that is not otherwise covered could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing businesses operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations 

acquisitions can have unanticipated results 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses in fiscal 2016  we spent 36 billion  to acquire other businesses including 11 billion to acquire harvard drug and 19 billion to acquire cordis acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management’s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties establishing or combining operations and systems we may assume 





liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural disasters or could be terminated a sustained supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a customer that has a substantial amount owed to us 

most of our customers buy products and services from us on credit which is made available to customers based on our assessment of creditworthiness the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

our cordis acquisition increased the extent of our exposure to the economic political and currency risks of international operations 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including north america south america europe and asia the scope and complexity of our international operations expanded with the acquisition of cordis and we may continue to expand our operations outside the united states global developments can affect our business in many ways our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and competition in addition we conduct our business in us dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results which are reported in us dollars we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures political changes also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets also can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services  

deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and therefore reduce purchases of our products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition deteriorating economic conditions may increase bankruptcies insolvencies or other credit failures of customers or suppliers which if they have a substantial amount owed to us also could adversely affect our results of operations

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also controls deemed effective now may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions or because compliance with policies or procedures has deteriorated or been circumvented 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016  in making this assessment management used the criteria established in the internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the “coso criteria” based on management’s assessment and the coso criteria management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2016

on october 2 2015  we completed the acquisition of cordis as permitted by guidelines established by the sec management excluded cordis from the scope of its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016  cordis constituted 7 percent and 29 percent of our total and net assets respectively as of june 30 2016  and less than 1 percent of both our revenue and operating earnings for the fiscal year then ended 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30 2016  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

implementation of new software systems 

the pharmaceutical segment is in a multiyear project implementing a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems which is expected to affect internal control over financial reporting this project did not impact internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2016 if these new systems are not effectively implemented or fail to operate as intended it could adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting

consolidated results 

fiscal 2016 overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2016  was 1215 billion  a 19 percent  increase from the prior year due primarily to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers and from acquisitions 

gaap and nongaap operating earnings 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2016  gaap operating earnings increased 14 percent  to 25 billion  and nongaap operating earnings increased 17 percent  to 29 billion  the increases in both gaap and nongaap operating earnings were due to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers performance under our pharmaceutical segment generics program and acquisitions partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes gaap operating earnings were negatively impacted by increased acquisitionrelated amortization partially offset by litigation recoveries 

 

gaap and nongaap diluted eps 



the sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding 

during fiscal 2016  gaap diluted earnings per share attributable to cardinal health inc diluted eps increased 20 percent  to 432  and nongaap diluted eps increased 20 percent  to 524  gaap and nongaap diluted eps increased primarily due to the same factors impacting gaap and nongaap operating earnings described above the increase in fiscal 2016  gaap diluted eps also reflects the prioryear loss on extinguishment of debt

our cash and equivalents balance was 24 billion  at june 30 2016  compared to 46 billion  at june 30 2015  the decrease in cash and equivalents during the fiscal 2016  was driven by 36 billion  deployed for acquisitions 512 million  paid in dividends 651 million  paid for share repurchases and 465 million  in capital expenditures partially offset by 30 billion  in cash provided by operating activities 





significant developments in fiscal 2016 and trends 

acquisitions 



cordis 

on october 2 2015 we completed the acquisition of the cordis business cordis from ethicon inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson for 19 billion using cash on hand and proceeds from our debt offering in june 2015 the acquisition of cordis a global manufacturer and distributor of interventional cardiology devices and endovascular solutions with operations in more than 50 countries expands our medical segments portfolio of selfmanufactured products and its geographic scope

party interest holders is reported as a reduction to net earnings in the consolidated statements of earnings at june 30 2016  our ownership interest in navihealth was 82 percent  due to an additional capital contribution in connection with an acquisition by navihealth refer to note 12 for further information on this acquisition

refer to note 2  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on acquisitions 

trends 



within our pharmaceutical segment we expect segment profit for fiscal 2017 to be essentially flat compared to fiscal 2016 the factors contributing to our expectation include less profit growth from the segment’s generics program and the loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer beginning april 1 2016 combined with the adverse impact of customer pricing changes similar to those in fiscal 2016 while we expect that the segment’s generics program will be positively impacted by benefits from both red oak sourcing and new generic pharmaceutical launches we expect that both of these items will have significantly less of a yearoveryear positive segment profit 

 

impact in fiscal 2017 than fiscal 2016 the impact of these factors will be more pronounced in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when we expect pharmaceutical segment profit to be significantly less than in the prioryear period and consolidated operating earnings to be less than in the prioryear period however as is generally the case the frequency magnitude and profit impact of future generic pharmaceutical product launches as well as other factors impacting our generics program are uncertain and their impact on fiscal 2017 pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings could be more or less than we expect 





results of operations 

revenue 





fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2016  pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers including continued branded pharmaceutical price appreciation all of which increased revenue by 169 billion acquisitions also contributed 21 billion to revenue growth 

medical segment 

fiscal 2016  medical segment revenue grew primarily due to acquisitions net of divestitures which contributed 645 million and sales growth from existing businesses 

 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   



pharmaceutical segment 

fiscal 2015   pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers which increased revenue by 137 billion the growth was primarily driven by increased sales to existing customers including continued branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and newly launched hepatitis c pharmaceutical products the increase was partially offset by 33 billion due to the walgreens contract expiration in the prioryear period 

medical segment 

fiscal 2015  medical segment revenue grew primarily due to acquisitions which contributed 344 million 

cost of products sold 



as a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue consolidated cost of products sold increased 182 billion   19 percent  and 109 billion   13 percent  during fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively see the gross margin discussion for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold 

 





gross margin 





fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015    

fiscal 2016  consolidated gross margin increased 831 million   15 percent  and was favorably impacted by sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers 510 million and acquisitions net of divestitures 576 million 

gross margin rate contracted during fiscal 2016  primarily due to changes in product mix driven by the onboarding of a new mail order customer starting in october 2015 and also due to the adverse impact of customer pricing changes our gross margin rate was favorably impacted by performance under our pharmaceutical segment generics program our generics program had strong yearoveryear performance from red oak sourcing 

 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

fiscal 2015  consolidated gross margin increased 551 million   11 percent  and was favorably impacted by sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers offset in part by the walgreens contract expiration in the prior year the net impact of these factors increased consolidated gross margin by 516 million in addition acquisitions favorably impacted gross margin by 101 million 

gross margin rate contracted slightly during fiscal 2015  reflecting the adverse impact of customer pricing changes the lower margin rate impact of newly launched hepatitis c pharmaceutical products and new customer mix largely offset by strong performance from our pharmaceutical segment generics program including benefits from red oak sourcing 

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

fiscal 2016  sga expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions net of divestitures 370 million 

 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

fiscal 2015  sga expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions 97 million and an overall increase in volume of sales to existing and new customers 





segment profit 



we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit among other measures see note 15  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 



fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2016  pharmaceutical segment profit increased due to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers and performance under our generics program partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes acquisitions also contributed to pharmaceutical segment profit growth our generics program benefited from strong yearoveryear performance from red oak sourcing 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2016  medical segment profit increased due to the contribution from cardinal health brand products acquisitions net of divestitures which included the unfavorable impact on cost of products sold from the fair value step up of inventory acquired with cordis also contributed to segment profit growth fiscal 2016  medical segment profit growth was partially offset by a decline in the results from our canada business 

corporate 

as discussed further in sections that follow the principal driver for the change in corporate during fiscal 2016  were increased amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs primarily related to the acquisitions of cordis and harvard drug partially offset by litigation recoveries 

 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

fiscal 2015  pharmaceutical segment profit increased due to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers and strong performance from our generics program including benefits from red oak sourcing partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes and the walgreens contract expiration in the prioryear period 

medical segment profit 

fiscal 2015  medical segment profit decreased primarily due to a decline in contribution from distribution of national brand products this was partially offset by contributions from the strategic expansion of our portfolio of cardinal health brand products and services driven by acquisitions and targeted cost reductions 

corporate 

as discussed further in sections that follow the principal driver for the change in corporate in fiscal 2015  were increased amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of cordis 





other components of consolidated operating earnings 



in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed previously consolidated operating earnings were impacted by the following 



amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 355 million 189 million and 187 million for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets during fiscal 2016  was largely due to the cordis and harvard drug acquisitions transaction and integration costs associated with the cordis acquisition were 78 million  and 44 million  during fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively 

 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2016  and 2015  we received and recognized income of 80 million  and 71 million  respectively from settlements of class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member 

during fiscal 2015  we incurred litigation charges of 68 million related to government investigations 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 



in addition to the items discussed above earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was impacted by the following 



other income net 

other income net for fiscal 2014  included a 32 million pretax gain related to the sale of our minority interest in two investments 

interest expense net 

fiscal 2016  interest expense increased primarily as a result of the additional 15 billion of debt issued in june 2015 to fund the harvard drug and cordis acquisitions 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in december 2014 we redeemed certain debt resulting in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 60 million 37 million net of tax 





provision for income taxes 



the provision for income taxes increased 90 million  in fiscal 2016  due to an increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes our effective tax rate decreased 13 percentage points during fiscal 2016  

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the distribution of income among nonus taxing jurisdictions with lower income tax rates and discrete items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 



fiscal 2016   



the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the state and local income tax rate which decreased 26 percentage points due to resolutions with state taxing authorities and a shift in the distribution of income among jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential decreased 18 percentage points primarily due to the deferred tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2015 

ongoing audits 

the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2006 through 2014 

 

fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014 



the fiscal 2015  effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the state and local income tax rate which increased 19 percentage points due to the derecognition of certain state tax benefits the foreign tax rate differential also increased 12 percentage points primarily due to recognition of deferred tax benefits resulting from new tax legislation in addition the change in measurement of uncertain tax positions increased 13 percentage points primarily as a result of proposed assessment of additional tax 

the fiscal 2014  effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete items of 37 million which reduced the rate by 21 percentage points the discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies 80 million and release of valuation allowances 12 million and the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits 65 million primarily as a result of proposed assessments of additional tax 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based on available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion contractual obligations tax payments and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 24 billion  at june 30 2016  compared to 46 billion  at june 30 2015  the decrease in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2016  was driven by 36 billion  deployed for acquisitions 512 million  paid in dividends 651 million  paid for share repurchases and 465 million  in capital expenditures partially offset by 30 billion  in cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by increased net earnings and working capital improvements at june 30 2016  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2016  included 475 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of cash is available for repatriation bringing the cash into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations because the earnings are considered permanently reinvested no us tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings it is not practicable to evaluate the amount of us tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings 

 

during fiscal 2015  net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion was positively impacted by working capital improvements these funds were deployed for 10 billion  of share repurchases 503 million  of acquisitions and 460 million  of cash dividends in addition during the second quarter of fiscal 2015  we refinanced 12 billion of longterm debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  we received proceeds from the issuance of additional longterm debt of 15 billion to fund the harvard drug and cordis acquisitions 

during fiscal 2014  we deployed 673 million  of cash on share repurchases 519 million  on acquisitions and 415 million  on dividends net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion  benefited from a net working capital decrease in excess of 500 million as a result of the walgreens contract expiration 

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

other financing arrangements and financial instruments 



credit facilities and commercial paper 

in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow other sources of liquidity at june 30 2016  include a 175 billion  revolving credit facility and a 700 million  committed receivables sales facility program in june 2016 we increased our revolving credit facility from 15 billion  to 175 billion  and decreased our committed receivables facility program from 950 million  to 700 million  we also have a commercial paper program of up to 15 billion  backed by the revolving credit facility at june 30 2016  we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility availability on the revolving credit facility was reduced by outstanding letters of credit of 14 million  at june 30 2016 we also had standby letters of credit of 40 million  issued under the committed receivables sales facility program at june 30 2016  

our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1  and our committed receivables sales facility also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter of at least 4to1 as of june 30 2016  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

 

availableforsale securities 

at june 30 2016  and 2015  we held 200 million  and 193 million  respectively of marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale 

longterm obligations 

at june 30 2016  we had total longterm obligations of 50 billion  

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as notes 1  and 11  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 





capital deployment 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2016  2015 and 2014 were 465 million  300 million  and 249 million  respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2017  to be between 400 million and 450 million primarily for information technology projects growth projects in our core business and integration of the cordis acquisition 

dividends 

during fiscal 2016  we paid quarterly dividends totaling 155  per share an increase of 13 percent  from fiscal 2015  

on may 4 2016 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 04489  per share or 180  per share on an annualized basis payable on july 15 2016 to shareholders of record on july 1 2016 

 

share repurchases 

our board of directors has approved a 20 billion share repurchase program which was completed in july 2016 on may 4 2016 our board of directors also approved an additional 10 billion share repurchase program that expires on december 31 2019 during fiscal 2016  we repurchased 651 million  of our common shares and from july 1 2016  through august 5 2016 we repurchased an additional 250 million  of our common shares we funded the repurchases with available cash at august 5 2016 we had 793 million  remaining under the new repurchase authorization 

acquisitions 

on july 2 2015 august 26 2015 and october 2 2015 we acquired harvard drug navihealth and cordis for 11 billion  net of cash acquired of 44 million  238 million  net of cash acquired of 53 million  and 19 billion respectively 





contractual obligations 

at june 30 2016  our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 





 

see note 7  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion of income taxes additionally the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests are excluded from the table as the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the redemption amount are uncertain see note 1  and note 12  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2016  as that term is defined in the sec rules 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 



trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 135 million  at both june 30 2016  and 2015  we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit to customers and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

our methodology for estimating the general reserve is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 

 

the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2016  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 8 million  

we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2016  are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue 

inventories 



a substantial portion of our inventories  58 percent  at both june 30 2016  and 2015  are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals generally tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a 

 

decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 

if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2016  or 2015  because inventories valued at lifo were 9 million  and 114 million  higher than the average cost value at june 30 2016  and june 30 2015  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such the lifo reserve was zero at both june 30 2016  and 2015  our remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market 





inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 79 million  and 57 million  at june 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase primarily reflects inventory reserves pertaining to cordis 

we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience historical and projected sales trends specific 

 

categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 



the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected 

 

future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names patents developed technology inprocess research and development and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives see note 2  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 

goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill 

our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 percent  to 125 percent  under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily inprocess research and development iprd requires comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for the indefinitelived intangible including among other factors assumptions on regulatory approval for iprd 

intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks trade names and patents and developed technology are amortized using a combination of straightline and accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the asset over their estimated useful lives we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires estimating future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts 





vendor reserves 



in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

 

vendor reserves were 62 million  and 88 million  at june 30 2016  and 2015  respectively approximately 66 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2016  pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 75 percent at the end of fiscal 2015  the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations in outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 

loss contingencies 



we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

 

we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 8  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies 

provision for income taxes 



our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



 expiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly after applying the valuation 

 

allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 7  of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective income tax rate by 1 percent would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease 23 million  for fiscal 2016  





sharebased compensation 



sharebased compensation provided to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

 

we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and postvesting forfeitures to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 16  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation

see note 15 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for pharmaceutical segment revenue profit and assets for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  

 

pharmaceutical distribution 

our pharmaceutical distribution division generates gross margin when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical program margin from pharmaceutical distribution agreements with branded manufacturers and margin from overthecounter healthcare and consumer products it also includes cash discounts margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts and rebates from manufacturers and may include price appreciation on some products our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time margin from pharmaceutical distribution agreements with branded manufacturers refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers and also includes benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciation 

sourcing venture with cvs health 

in july 2014  we established red oak sourcing a usbased generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with cvs health with an initial term of 10 years  both companies have contributed sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 5050 venture and have committed to source generic pharmaceuticals through arrangements negotiated by the venture red oak sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies

acquisitions 



we have acquired a number of businesses over the last several years that have enhanced our core strategic areas of generics health systems and hospital solutions including manufactured medical products specialty pharmaceutical products and services international and alternate sites of care we expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 

since july 1 2010 we have completed or expect to complete the following six larger acquisitions 





 

in addition we completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years including in fiscal 2015 tradex international inc a supplier of disposable gloves and metro medical supply inc a distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical products in fiscal 2014 access closure inc a manufacturer and distributor of extravascular closure devices and in fiscal 2012 futuremed healthcare products corporation a canadian medical product distributor 





customers 



our largest customer cvs health accounted for 27 percent  of our fiscal 2015  revenue in the aggregate our five largest customers including cvs health accounted for 41 percent  of our fiscal 2015 revenue 

in addition we have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents to negotiate vendor 

 

contracts on behalf of their members our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp sales to members of these two gpos under numerous contracts across all of our businesses collectively accounted for 18 percent  of our revenue in fiscal 2015  

suppliers 



we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 22 percent  of our revenue during fiscal 2015  but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 7 percent  of revenue 

the pharmaceutical distribution division is a party to distribution service agreements with most pharmaceutical manufacturers these 

 

agreements have terms ranging from one year to five years most provide for an automatic renewal feature of one year some agreements allow either party and in some instances only the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause subject to a defined notice period 

competition 



we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products we compete on many levels including price service offerings support services and breadth of product lines 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies companies that provide services supporting the development marketing distribution and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products and nuclear pharmacies among others   in addition the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition 

 

from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers we also compete with manufacturers that sell all or part of their product offerings directly

employees 



at june 30 2015  we had approximately 24400 employees in the united states and approximately 10100 employees outside of the 

 

united states overall we consider our employee relations to be good 

intellectual property 



we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents relating to some medical and surgical products and to distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 

 

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 





regulatory matters 



our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon their specific business our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements they can suspend our ability to distribute products or can initiate product recalls they can seize products or impose criminal civil and administrative sanctions and they can seek injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products 

distribution 

the fda dea and various state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various state and federal statutes including the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the federal controlled substances act the csa which governs the sale packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa 

manufacturing and marketing 

the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing including good manufacturing practices quality systems labeling promotion and advertising distribution importation and postmarket surveillance of most of our manufactured products in addition we need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities before we can market and sell some of these products in the united states and certain other countries even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances to market a 

 

medical device and such approvals or clearances might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action which may include withdrawing the product from the market correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 

our nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the nrc applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate in addition our cyclotron facilities must comply with the fdas good manufacturing practices regulations for positron emission tomography or pet drugs 

prescription drug tracing and supply chain integrity 

in november 2013 the us congress enacted the drug supply chain security act this law establishes a phasedin national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs the first phase of implementation began on january 1 2015 and upon full implementation in 2023 we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug tracing system

our cardinal health at home business and a few of our other businesses are medicarecertified suppliers or participate in state medicaid programs these businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations including applicable billing payment and recordkeeping requirements in addition a few of our businesses manufacture or repackage pharmaceuticals and are subject to federal and state laws that establish eligibility for reimbursement by federal and state healthcare programs failure to comply with applicable standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the 





loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

in addition our us federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

health and personal information practices 

we collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable healthcare information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act as well as some state and foreign laws regulate the use and disclosure of patientidentifiable health information including requiring specified privacy and security measures 

we also collect handle and maintain other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 

in europe we are subject to the european union “eu” data protection regulations including the eu directive on data protection which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states 

antitrust laws 

the us federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages as previously disclosed in april 2015 we settled allegations by the ftc resulting 

 

from an investigation into supplier arrangements involving our nuclear pharmacy services division primarily focused on the period between 2003 and 2008 in that settlement we agreed to a court order and injunction under federal antitrust laws and agreed among other things to pay 27 million  to the ftc which the ftc has stated will be used to establish a fund for allegedly aggrieved third parties 

environmental health and safety laws 

in the united states and other countries we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices

other information 



although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect 

 

inventory levels 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers

risk factors 



the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the business section we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate further consolidation among our customers and suppliers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may adversely impact our results of operations 

our pharmaceutical segments margins are affected by prices established by manufacturers the frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches and other factors that are beyond our control 

gross margin in our pharmaceutical segment is impacted by pharmaceutical price appreciation and the number and value of pharmaceutical launches in past years these items have impacted yearoveryear margins 

prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time but at times some generic products experience price appreciation which may positively impact our margins the frequency and magnitude of future generic product price appreciation is uncertain 

prices for branded pharmaceuticals on the other hand generally increase over time the frequency and magnitude of branded product price appreciation also is uncertain and branded manufacturers may determine not to increase prices or to implement only modest increases which can limit our margins 

the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches varies from year to year and the margin impact of new launches varies from product to product fewer generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those previously experienced will have an adverse effect on our yearoveryear margins 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated as described in greater detail in the business section we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in china and other foreign countries if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

cvs health is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs health accounted for 27 percent  of our fiscal 2015  revenue and 20 percent  of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2015  if cvs health were to terminate the agreement due to an alleged default by us default in payment or significantly reduce its purchases of our products and services our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the anticipated benefits of our generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with cvs health may not be realized 

in july 2014 we established the red oak sourcing venture with cvs health with an initial term of 10 years red oak sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies we are required to pay quarterly payments to cvs health if the venture does not continue to be successful our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states such as the repeal of lastin firstout or lifo treatment of inventory or a change in the current us taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these 

 

challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition 

the us healthcare environment is changing in many ways some of which may not be favorable to us 

the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety contain costs and increase efficiencies medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have generally declined and the basis for payments is changing shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models the use of managed care has increased distributors manufacturers healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and have formed strategic alliances and large purchasing groups are prevalent the industry also is experiencing a shift away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics and physician offices and in some cases patients’ homes we could be adversely affected directly or indirectly if our customers are adversely affected by these and other changes in the delivery pricing or utilization of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical products or healthcare services 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 

we rely on our information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center our results of operations could be adversely affected if our information systems or critical facilities or our customers access to them are interrupted these systems or facilities are damaged or these systems or facilities fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic or power outage or due to cyber security incidents or other actions of third parties 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce the techniques used by those seeking to obtain unauthorized access to our information systems or to those of a thirdparty service provider or to disable them degrade their service or sabotage them change frequently in addition these techniques may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any compromise of our information systems or those of a thirdparty 





service provider including the unauthorized access use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements including those related to patientidentifiable health information 

the pharmaceutical segment is in the initial phases of a multiyear upgrade of certain finance and operating systems if these system upgrades are not effectively implemented or they fail to operate as intended it could adversely affect the pharmaceutical segment’s supply chain operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

because of the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings for instance some of the products that we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury subjecting us to product liability claims we also may be named in breach of contract claims or qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments 

our medical segments manufacturing businesses operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations 

acquisitions can have unanticipated results 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses in fiscal 2015  we spent 503 million  to acquire other businesses and we acquired harvard drug in july 2015 for 11 billion and entered into an agreement to acquire cordis for 19 billion acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets or we may encounter unforeseen accounting internal control regulatory or compliance issues once completed the cordis acquisition will subject us to additional risks relating to regulatory matters legal proceedings tax laws or positions and as discussed later in this section global operations 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural 

 

disasters or could be terminated a sustained supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a customer or supplier that has a substantial amount owed to us 

most of our customers buy products and services from us on credit which is made available to customers based on our assessment of creditworthiness in addition our relationships with suppliers give rise to amounts owed to us for returned or defective goods and chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer or supplier that has a substantial amount owed to us could adversely affect our results of operations 

our global operations are subject to economic political and currency risks 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states including north america south america europe and asia the scope and complexity of our international operations will expand with the acquisition of cordis global economic and regulatory developments can affect our business in many ways our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition political changes also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these risks and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these risks divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries 

economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services  

deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and therefore reduce purchases of our products and services by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition deteriorating economic conditions may increase bankruptcies insolvencies or other credit failures of customers or suppliers which if they have a substantial amount owed to us also could adversely affect our results of operations

consolidated results 

     

fiscal 2015 overview 



revenue 

revenue for fiscal 2015  was 1025 billion  a 13 percent  increase from the prioryear period due primarily to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers revenue growth was negatively impacted in fiscal 2015  due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co walgreens on august 31 2013 

gaap and nongaap operating earnings 



gaap operating earnings increased 15 percent  to 22 billion  compared to the prior year reflecting sales growth from existing and new customers and strong performance from our pharmaceutical segment generics program offset in part by customer pricing changes and the walgreens contract expiration in the prioryear period nongaap operating earnings increased 16 percent  to 25 billion  during fiscal 2015  also due to the factors impacting gaap operating earnings 

 

gaap and nongaap diluted eps 



gaap diluted eps increased 024  or 7 percent  to 361  during fiscal 2015  and nongaap diluted eps increased 054  or 14 percent  to 438  during fiscal 2015  gaap and nongaap diluted eps increased primarily due to the factors impacting gaap and nongaap operating earnings as well as a lower share count driven by share repurchases and partially offset by an increase in income taxes gaap diluted eps was also impacted by a 37 million aftertax loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 46 billion  and 29 billion  at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively in june 2015 we issued 15 billion of additional debt to fund a portion of the acquisitions of the harvard drug group harvard drug which closed on july 2 2015 and the cordis business of johnson  johnson which is expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 these acquisitions are both discussed in more detail in significant developments in fiscal 2015 and trends that follows this section during fiscal 2015  net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion was deployed for share repurchases of 10 billion  acquisitions of 503 million  and cash dividends of 460 million  in addition during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we refinanced 12 billion of longterm debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities 





significant developments in fiscal 2015 and trends 

acquisitions 



harvard drug 

on july 2 2015  we completed the acquisition of harvard drug for 11 billion  net of cash acquired using existing cash and proceeds from the debt offering in june 2015  the acquisition of harvard drug a distributor of generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare and related products to retail institutional and alternate care customers is expected to enhance our pharmaceutical segments generic pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses harvard drug also manufactures and repackages generic pharmaceuticals and overthecounter healthcare products 

cordis 

on march 1 2015  we entered into a binding offer letter with ethicon inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson to purchase its cordis business for a purchase price of 19 billion  in cash subject 

 

to certain adjustments on may 27 2015 ethicon accepted the offer the acquisition of cordis a manufacturer and distributor of interventional cardiology devices and endovascular solutions is expected to expand our medical segments portfolio of selfmanufactured products and its geographic scope cordis is a global company with operations in more than 50 countries the acquisition is expected to close in approximately 20  principal countries during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and in the remaining countries afterward subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions we expect this acquisition to significantly reduce gaap operating earnings and earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 largely due to the expected impact of amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

generic sourcing venture with cvs health 



in july 2014  we established red oak sourcing llc red oak sourcing a usbased generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with cvs health corporation “cvs health” with an initial term of 10 years  both companies have contributed sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 5050 venture and have committed to source generic pharmaceuticals through arrangements negotiated by the venture red oak sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies we are required to pay 39   

 

quarterly payments of 256 million  to cvs health which commenced in october 2014  due to the achievement of a milestone the quarterly payment to cvs health will increase by 10 million beginning in fiscal 2016 in addition if an additional milestone is achieved the quarterly payment will increase in fiscal 2017  by a further 10 million  resulting in a maximum quarterly payment of 456 million  if all milestones are met 

trends 



within our pharmaceutical segment pharmaceutical price appreciation on brand products and some generic products positively impacted our earnings during fiscal 2015 but as is generally the case the frequency and magnitude of future brand and generic product price appreciation is uncertain and the impact on earnings may be less in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015 

 

additionally within our pharmaceutical segment as is generally the case the impact and timing of future generic pharmaceutical product launches is uncertain and the impact on earnings may be less in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015 see the pharmaceutical segment discussion within the business section for additional information regarding pharmaceutical price appreciation and generic pharmaceutical product launches 

  





results of operations 

 

revenue 





fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   



pharmaceutical segment 

revenue growth for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers which increased revenue by 137 billion during fiscal 2015  the growth was primarily driven by increased sales to existing customers including continued branded pharmaceutical price inflation and newly launched hepatitis c pharmaceutical products the increase was partially offset by the walgreens contract expiration in the prioryear period 33 billion 

medical segment

fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013

revenue for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was negatively impacted by the walgreens contract expiration 169 billion and by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts inc express scripts on september 30 2012 20 billion this decrease was partially offset by sales growth from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers 71 billion 

medical segment 

revenue growth for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to acquisitions 816 million 

cost of products sold 



as a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue consolidated cost of products sold increased 109 billion   13 percent  and decreased 102 billion   11 percent  during fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively see the gross margin discussion for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold 





gross margin 





fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014    

consolidated gross margin increased during fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  by 551 million

consolidated gross margin rate contracted slightly during fiscal 2015  reflecting the adverse impact of customer pricing changes the lower margin rate impact of newly launched hepatitis c pharmaceutical products and new customer mix largely offset by strong performance from our generics program including benefits from red oak sourcing 

 

fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013    

consolidated gross margin increased during fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  by 240 million 

gross margin for fiscal 2014  was positively impacted by 32 million due to sales growth which primarily reflects growth from existing customers and was largely offset by the impact of the walgreens contract expiration in addition acquisitions positively impacted gross margin by 221 million

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 





fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

the increase in sga expenses during fiscal 2015  over 2014  was primarily due to acquisitions 97 million and an overall increase in volume of sales to existing and new customers 

 

fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   



pharmaceutical segment profit 

the increase in pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2015  over 2014  reflected sales growth from existing and new pharmaceutical distribution customers and strong performance from our generics program including benefits from red oak sourcing partially offset by the adverse impact of customer pricing changes and the walgreens contract expiration in the prioryear period 

medical segment profit 

the decrease in medical segment profit in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to a decline in contribution from distribution of national brand products this was partially offset by contributions from the strategic expansion of our portfolio of cardinal health brand products and services driven by acquisitions and targeted cost reductions 

corporate 

as discussed further in sections that follow the principal driver for the change in corporate in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the pending acquisition of cordis 

 

fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013

restructuring and employee severance 

the majority of restructuring and employee severance incurred during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were related to activities within our medical segment 

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 189 million 187 million and 118 million for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively during 2015 amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs included 44 million  of transaction and integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of cordis we anticipate a significant increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in fiscal 2016 as a result of the harvard drug and cordis acquisitions and in other acquisitionrelated costs due to the size and complexity of the cordis integration 

 

impairments and gainloss on disposal of assets 

during fiscal 2013  we recognized an 829 million   799 million  net of tax goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division as discussed further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2015  we incurred litigation charges of 41 million  related to the dea investigation and related matters and 27 million  related to the ftc investigation and we recognized litigation recoveries of 71 million  primarily consisting of settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member these matters are discussed further in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we recognized litigation recoveries resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims of 24 million and 38 million during 2014 and 2013 respectively 

earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations 



in addition to the items discussed above earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following 



other income net 

other income net for fiscal 2014  included a 32 million pretax gain related to the sale of our minority interest in two investments 

interest expense net 

we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal 2016 as a result of the additional 15 billion of debt issued to fund the harvard drug acquisition and pending cordis acquisition 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in december 2014 we redeemed certain debt resulting in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 60 million  37 million  net of tax see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 





provision for income taxes 



the provision for income taxes increased 120 million in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 due to an increase in earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations and an increase in our effective tax rate of 31 percentage points 

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and us state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation 



fiscal 2015   



the fiscal 2015  effective income tax rate was impacted by the state and local income tax rate which increased 19 percentage points due to the derecognition of certain state tax benefits the foreign tax rate differential also increased 12 percentage points primarily due to recognition of deferred tax benefits resulting from new tax legislation in addition the change in measurement of uncertain tax positions increased 13 percentage points primarily as a result of proposed assessment of additional tax 

ongoing audits 

the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 

 

fiscal 2014   

the fiscal 2014  effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete items of 37 million which reduced the rate by 21 percentage points the discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies 80 million and release of valuation allowances 12 million and the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits 65 million primarily as a result of proposed assessments of additional tax 

fiscal 2013 



the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 332 percentage points 295 million due to the nondeductibility of substantially all of the goodwill impairment related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which was partially offset by the favorable impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings as a result of an agreement with tax authorities 64 million or 72 percentage points 





liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based upon available capital resources cash on hand and committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures currently anticipated business growth and expansion including the pending acquisition of cordis contractual obligations tax payments and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital markets for additional financing 

cash and equivalents 



our cash and equivalents balance was 46 billion  at june 30 2015  and 29 billion  at june 30 2014  we acquired harvard drug on july 2 2015 for 11 billion net of cash acquired and expect to acquire cordis during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for 19 billion at june 30 2015  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

during fiscal 2015  net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion was positively impacted by working capital improvements these funds were deployed for 10 billion  of share repurchases 503 million  of acquisitions and  460 million  of cash dividends in addition during the second quarter of fiscal 2015  we refinanced 12 billion of longterm debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  we received proceeds from the issuance of additional longterm debt of 15 billion to fund the harvard drug and cordis acquisitions 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2015  included 423 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations as a us parent 

 

company we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 

during fiscal 2014  we deployed 673 million  of cash on share repurchases 519 million  on acquisitions and 415 million  on dividends net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion  benefited from a net working capital decrease in excess of 500 million as a result of the walgreens contract expiration 

during fiscal 2013  we deployed 22 billion  of cash on acquisitions 450 million  on share repurchases and 353 million  on dividends during fiscal 2013  we received net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 981 million which were used for the acquisition of assuramed inc net cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion  

changes in working capital which impact operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix 

financial instruments and other financing arrangements 



credit facilities and commercial paper 

on november 3 2014 we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through cardinal health funding llc until november 3 2017 and increased the size of the facility from 700 million  to 950 million  with the inclusion of certain receivables from the medical segment other sources of liquidity include a 15 billion  revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to 15 billion  backed by the revolving credit facility at both june 30 2015  and 2014  we had no  outstanding balances or borrowings under these facilities except for standby letters of credit of 41 million  under the committed receivables sales facility program 

our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain as of any fiscal quarter end a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 4to1  and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1  as of june 30 2015  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

 

availableforsale securities 

at june 30 2015  and 2014 we held 193 million  and 100 million respectively of marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale 

longterm obligations 

in june 2015  we sold 550 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  notes that mature on june 15 2018  500 million  aggregate principal amount of 375  notes that mature on september 15 2025  and 450 million  aggregate principal amount of 49  notes that mature on september 15 2045  we used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to acquire harvard drug on july 2 2015 and plan to use the remainder to acquire cordis during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 

in november 2014 we sold 450 million aggregate principal amount of 24 notes that mature on november 15 2019 400 million aggregate principal amount of 35 notes that mature on november 15 2024 and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 45 notes that mature on november 15 2044 





in december 2014 we used the net proceeds from the november offering together with cash on hand to redeem all of our outstanding 40 notes due 2015 58 notes due 2016 585 notes due 2017 and 60 notes due 2017 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest plus the makewhole premium applicable to each series of notes as a result of this redemption during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt of  60 million   37 million  net of tax 

 

risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section as well as notes 1 and 12 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

capital deployment 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013 were  300 million  249 million  and 195 million  respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to be between 510 million and 540 million primarily for growth projects in our core businesses information technology projects and integration of the cordis acquisition 

dividends 

during fiscal 2015  we paid quarterly dividends totaling 137  per share an increase of 13 percent  from fiscal 2014  on may 6 2015 our board of directors approved a 13 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to 03870  per share or 155  per share on an annualized basis which was paid on july 15 2015 to shareholders of record on july 1 2015 

on august 5 2015 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 03870 per share or 155 per share on an annualized basis payable on october 15 2015 to shareholders of record on october 1 2015 

 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2015  we repurchased 10 billion  of our common shares 

on october 29 2013 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program and on august 6 2014 the board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion under the program for a total of 20 billion this program expires on december 31 2016 at june 30 2015  we had 693 million  remaining under this repurchase authorization 

acquisitions 

in fiscal 2015 we acquired a number of businesses in both the pharmaceutical and medical segments for an aggregate of 503 million and as previously noted entered into agreements to acquire harvard drug and cordis we expect these acquired businesses to enhance our core strategic areas of generics health systems and hospital solutions including manufactured medical products specialty pharmaceutical products and services international and alternate sites of care 





contractual obligations 

at june 30 2015  our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 





 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2015  

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for a discussion of additional accounting policies see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 



trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us through our distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 135 million  and 137 million  at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 270 days to 5 years  at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and related accrued interest are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 14 million  and 18 million  at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

our methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed 

 

quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 

the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and finance notes receivables at june 30 2015  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 7 million  

we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal june 30 2015  are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue 

inventories 



a substantial portion of our inventories  58 percent  and 61 percent at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals generally tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our 

 

older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 

the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2015  or 2014  inventories valued at lifo were 114 million  and 98 million  higher than the average   





cost value at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2015  and 2014  

inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 57 million   

 

and 44 million  at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 



the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names patents developed technology and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when 

 

an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 



purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful lives 

goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its identifiable net assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal 

 

health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health at home division and cardinal health at home division 

fair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 85  to 11 percent  under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services 





division which was fully impaired in fiscal 2013  concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013  if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of these reporting units for fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  as discussed further in note 4 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  we recognized an 829 million   799 million  net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division 

 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 

vendor reserves 



in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

 

vendor reserves were 88 million  and 82 million  at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively approximately 75 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2015  pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 68 percent at the end of fiscal 2014  the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

loss contingencies 



we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 

 

we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 9 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies 

provision for income taxes 



our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 

 



 expiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after applying the valuation 





allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon 

 

examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent  likely of being realized upon settlement see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective income tax rate by 1 percent would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease 20 million  for fiscal 2015  

sharebased compensation 



sharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

 

we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and postvesting forfeitures to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation 





supplemental information 

financial measures that supplement us generally accepted accounting principles measures nongaap financial measures 

the key highlights section and the fiscal 2015 overview discussion within mda in this form 10k contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap in general the measures exclude items and charges that we do not believe reflect our core business and relate more to strategic multiyear corporate activities or the items and charges relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate our performance evaluate the balance sheet engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation 

we provide these nongaap financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors however the 

 

nongaap financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

the nongaap financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated 

following are definitions of the nongaap financial measures presented in this form 10k and reconciliations of the differences between the nongaap financial measures and their most directly comparable gaap financial measures

we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 24 percent  of our revenue during fiscal 2014  but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 6 percent  of revenue overall we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good 

the pharmaceutical distribution division is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these agreements have terms ranging from one year to five years most provide for an automatic renewal feature of one year some agreements allow either party and in some instances only the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause subject to a defined notice period 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products we compete on many levels including service offerings support services breadth of product lines and price

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

regulatory matters 

our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon their specific business our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including

our home division is a medicarecertified supplier and participates in state medicaid programs with respect to a small portion of its business it must meet quality standards and maintain accreditation to receive government reimbursement and must comply with applicable billing payment and recordkeeping requirements failure to comply with quality standards and billing requirements could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

in addition our us federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

health and personal information practices 

some of our businesses collect handle and maintain patientidentifiable healthcare information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act as well as some state laws regulate the use and disclosure of patientidentifiable health information including requiring specified privacy and security measures federal and state officials have increasingly focused on how patientidentifiable healthcare information should be handled secured and disclosed 

some of our businesses collect handle and maintain other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate

other information 

although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

the us healthcare environment is changing in many ways some of which may not be favorable to us 

the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety contain costs and increase efficiencies medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined the use of managed care has increased distributors manufacturers healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and have formed strategic alliances and large purchasing groups are prevalent the industry also has experienced a shift away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics and physician offices and in some cases patients’ homes we could be adversely affected directly or indirectly if our customers are adversely affected by these and other changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical devices or healthcare services 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in item 1 business above we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures or additional service offerings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate further consolidation among our customers and suppliers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may adversely impact our results of operations 

our pharmaceutical segments margin may be affected by prices established by manufacturers fewer or less profitable generic pharmaceutical launches and other factors that are beyond our control 

as described in greater detail in item 1 business above gross margin in our pharmaceutical segment is impacted by generic and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and the number 



and value of generic pharmaceutical launches in past years these items have been substantial drivers of pharmaceutical segment profit 

prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time but at times some generic products experience price appreciation which positively impacts our margins the frequency and magnitude of future generic product price appreciation is uncertain 

prices for branded pharmaceuticals on the other hand generally increase over time the frequency and magnitude of branded product price appreciation also is uncertain and branded manufacturers may determine not to increase prices or to implement only modest increases which can limit our margin 

the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches varies from year to year and the margin impact of new launches varies from product to product fewer generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those previously experienced will have an adverse effect on our yearoveryear margins 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated as described in greater detail in item 1 business above we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in china and other foreign countries if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to obtain and hold permits licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of numerous governmental bodies failure to maintain or renew necessary permits licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

products that we manufacture source distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product recalls or seizures or criminal or civil sanctions in addition it can be costly and timeconsuming to obtain regulatory approvals to market a medical device and such approvals might not be granted on a timely basis if at all 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the requirements of these laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices which may adversely affect our operations results of operations and financial condition if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to federal or state government investigations 

 

or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our home division is a medicarecertified supplier and participates in state medicaid programs with respect to a small portion of its business its failure to comply with quality standards and billing requirements could result in civil or criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work 

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act chinese anticorruption laws and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions 

our china operations are subject to national regional and local regulations the regulatory environment in china is evolving and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations it is possible that the chinese governments current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our china operations result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties 

cvs caremark is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs accounted for 28 percent  of our fiscal 2014  revenue and 22 percent  of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2014  if cvs were to terminate the agreement due to an alleged default by us default in payment or significantly reduce its purchases of our products and services our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the anticipated benefits of our generic pharmaceutical sourcing joint venture with cvs caremark may not be realized 

in july 2014  we established the red oak sourcing joint venture with cvs with an initial term of 10 years  red oak sourcing will negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies we are required to pay 39 quarterly payments of 256 million  to cvs commencing in october 2014 without regard to the level of benefits we receive if the benefits of the joint venture do not exceed our required payments to cvs our 



results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states such as the repeal of lastin firstout or lifo treatment of inventory or a change in the current us taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 

we rely on our information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center our results of operations could be adversely affected if our information systems or critical facilities or our customers access to them are interrupted these systems or facilities are damaged or these systems or facilities fail whether due to physical disruptions such as fire natural disaster pandemic or power outage or due to cyber security incidents or other actions of third parties 

our business relies on the secure transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including patientidentifiable health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce the techniques used by those seeking to obtain unauthorized access to our information systems or disable them degrade their service or sabotage them change frequently in addition these techniques may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any compromise of our information systems or those of a thirdparty service 

 

provider including the unauthorized access use or disclosure of sensitive information could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements including those related to patientidentifiable health information 

because of the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings for instance some of the products that we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims 

our medical segments manufacturing businesses operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation is costly to defend and can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 

we also may be named in breach of contract claims or qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations 

acquisitions can have unanticipated results 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses in fiscal 2014 we spent  519 million  to acquire other businesses acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets or we may encounter unforeseen accounting internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural disasters or could be terminated a sustained supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile 



and can fluctuate significantly causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations are subject to economic political and currency risks 

our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition political changes also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location we may not be able to hedge or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks and any hedges or insurance may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 

economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services  

deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and therefore reduce purchases of our products and services by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations

the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are referring to our continuing operations 

overview 

we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies hospitals and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs enhancing efficiency and improving quality we also provide medical products to patients in the home 

we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 

during fiscal 2014  revenue decreased 10 percent  to 911 billion  largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co walgreens on august 31 2013 

gross margin increased 5 percent  to 52 billion  reflecting the positive impact of acquisitions and strong performance from generic programs offset in part by the impact of the walgreens contract expiration 

operating earnings increased to 19 billion  and earnings from continuing operations increased to 12 billion  due primarily to an 829 million   799 million  net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013  

our cash and equivalents balance was 29 billion  at june 30 2014  compared to 19 billion  at june 30 2013  the increase  in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2014  was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion  which includes the decrease in our net working capital associated with the walgreens contract expiration net cash provided by operating activities was deployed for share repurchases  673 million  acquisitions  519 million  and dividends  415 million  we plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value 

walgreens contract 

the walgreens contract expiration unfavorably impacted periodoverperiod comparisons of revenue and operating earnings for fiscal 2014  but favorably affected net cash provided by operating activities due to a significant reduction in net working capital because revenue from walgreens was 33 billion during the first quarter of fiscal 2014  we expect the 

 

contract expiration to have an adverse impact on our periodoverperiod comparisons of revenue and operating earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 

joint venture with cvs caremark 

in july 2014  we established red oak sourcing llc “red oak sourcing” a usbased generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity with cvs caremark corporation “cvs” with an initial term of 10 years  both companies have contributed sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 5050 joint venture and have committed to source generic pharmaceuticals through arrangements negotiated by it red oak sourcing will negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies but will not own products or hold inventory on behalf of either company we are required to pay 39  quarterly payments of 256 million  to cvs commencing in october 2014 and only if certain milestones are achieved to pay additional predetermined amounts to cvs beginning in fiscal 2016 the fixed payments of 256 million  will be expensed evenly commencing with the rampup of the venture which we expect to begin by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 no physical assets were contributed by either company to red oak sourcing and minimal funding has been provided to capitalize the entity 

acquisitions 

we have completed several acquisitions since july 1 2011 the largest of which were assuramed inc assuramed in fiscal 2013  and access closure inc accessclosure in fiscal 2014  

on may 9 2014  we completed the acquisition of accessclosure for 320 million  in an allcash transaction we funded the acquisition with cash on hand the acquisition of accessclosure a manufacturer and distributor of extravascular closure devices expands the medical segments portfolio of selfmanufactured products 

on march 18 2013  we completed the acquisition of assuramed for 207 billion  net of cash acquired in an allcash transaction we funded the acquisition through the issuance of 13 billion  in fixed rate notes and cash on hand the acquisition of assuramed a provider of medical supplies to homecare providers and patients in the home expands medical segments ability to serve this patient base the assuramed division is now known as our cardinal health at home division home division this acquisition increased revenue and operating earnings during fiscal 2014  the increase in amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs during fiscal 2014  was primarily due to intangible assets from this acquisition we expect the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets to continue to be a significant expense in future periods 

see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions 



goodwill 

as part of our annual goodwill impairment test during fiscal 2013  we concluded that the entire goodwill amount of our nuclear pharmacy services division was impaired resulting in a noncash impairment charge of 829 million   799 million  net of tax this impairment charge did not impact our liquidity cash flows from operations or compliance with debt covenants see note 5 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

restructuring 

on january 30 2013 we announced a restructuring plan within our medical segment under this restructuring plan among other things we have reorganized our medical segment moved production of procedure kits from our facility in waukegan illinois to other facilities and consolidated office space in waukegan illinois in addition we are selling property in waukegan illinois and we are exiting our gamma sterilization business in el paso texas we currently estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately 74 million  on a pretax basis of which 18 million  and 51 million  was recognized in fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  respectively 

trends 

within our pharmaceutical segment pharmaceutical price appreciation on some generic products positively impacted our margins during fiscal 2014  but the frequency and magnitude of future generic product price appreciation is uncertain and the impact on earnings may be less in fiscal 2015 than in fiscal 2014 

results of operations 

revenue 



fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013 

pharmaceutical segment 

revenue for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was negatively impacted by the walgreens contract expiration 169 billion and by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts inc express scripts on september 30 2012 20 billion this decrease was partially offset by sales growth from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers 71 billion 

medical segment 

revenue for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  reflects the benefit of acquisitions 816 million 

 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012 

pharmaceutical segment 

revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012  was negatively impacted by the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts approximately 67 billion revenue from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers decreased by approximately 36 billion primarily as a result of brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions the decrease was partially offset by increased pharmaceutical distribution revenue from new customers approximately 38 billion and revenue growth within our specialty solutions division 961 million 

medical segment 

revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012  reflects the benefit of acquisitions 459 million 

cost of products sold 

as a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue cost of products sold decreased 102 billion   11 percent  and 68 billion   7 percent  during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  respectively see the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold 

gross margin 



fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013 

gross margin increased during fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  240 million reflecting the positive impact of acquisitions 221 million 

gross margin for fiscal 2014  was positively impacted by 32 million due to sales growth which primarily reflects growth from existing customers and was largely offset by the impact of the walgreens contract expiration 

gross margin rate apart from the impact of the walgreens contract expiration was flat for fiscal 2014  gross margin rate was positively impacted by strong performance from generic programs including the impact of generic pharmaceutical price appreciation and was adversely impacted by customer pricing changes 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012 

gross margin increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012  driven by strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs 350 million and acquisitions 131 million increased margin from branded pharmaceutical distribution agreements exclusive of the related volume impact also had a positive impact on gross margin 81 million pricing changes including rebates exclusive of the related volume impact adversely impacted gross margin 211 million driven in part by customer and product mix the adverse impact of these 



pricing changes was offset by sourcing programs and other sources of margin as a result of significant market softness gross margin from our nuclear pharmacy services division decreased by 71 million in fiscal 2013  

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 



sga expenses increased during fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  primarily due to acquisitions 129 million 

sga expenses increased during fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012  primarily due to acquisitions 84 million and investment spending 17 million 

segment profit and consolidated operating earnings 



segment profit 

we evaluate segment performance based upon segment profit among other measures see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 

pharmaceutical segment profit 

the increase in fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  reflected the positive impact of sales growth which primarily reflects growth from existing customers and was largely offset by the impact of the walgreens contract expiration the impact of gross margin rate apart from the impact of the walgreens contract expiration was flat for fiscal 2014  gross margin rate was positively impacted by strong performance from generic programs including the impact of generic pharmaceutical price appreciation and was adversely impacted by customer pricing changes 

the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012  were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical distribution agreements these benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution pricing changes and significant market softness in our nuclear pharmacy services division 

 

medical segment profit 

the principal driver for the increase in fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  was the positive impact of acquisitions 

the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012  were the positive impact of acquisitions and decreased cost of commodities used in our selfmanufactured products partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pricing changes driven in part by customer and product mix segment profit was also moderated by softness in proceduralbased utilization the 23 percent excise tax on certain manufactured or imported medical devices that became effective january 1 2013 had a slightly unfavorable impact on segment profit 

corporate 

as discussed further below the principal driver for the change in corporate in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013  was an 829 million noncash goodwill impairment charge recognized in fiscal 2013  related to our nuclear pharmacy services division 

consolidated operating earnings 

in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed above operating earnings were impacted by the following 



restructuring and employee severance 

in addition to other restructuring activities during fiscal 2014  and 2013  we recognized restructuring costs of 10 million  and 40 million  respectively related to the restructuring plan in our medical segment we also recognized 11 million  of employeerelated costs related to a restructuring plan within our nuclear pharmacy services division during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 187 million 118 million and 78 million for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in amortization during 2014  and 2013  was primarily due to intangible assets from the acquisition of assuramed we also recognized transaction costs associated with the purchase of assuramed of 20 million during fiscal 2013  

amortization and other acquisitionrelated costs for fiscal 2012  included income recognized upon adjustment of the contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with the healthcare solutions holding llc p4 healthcare acquisition  71 million  in early fiscal 2013  we terminated and settled the remaining contingent consideration obligation for 4 million  



impairments and loss on disposal of assets 

during fiscal 2014  we recognized an 8 million  loss to write down property in waukegan illinois in connection with our medical segment restructuring plan 

also in connection with our medical segment restructuring plan during fiscal 2013  we recognized an 11 million loss to write down our gamma sterilization assets in el paso texas 

during fiscal 2013  we recognized an 829 million   799 million  net of tax goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division as discussed further in the overview section and in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we also recognized an 8 million loss during fiscal 2013  to write down commercial software under development within our pharmaceutical segment 

during fiscal 2012  we recognized a 16 million  loss to write down an indefinitelife intangible asset related to the p4 healthcare trade name 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

we recognized income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member of 24 million  and 38 million  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively 

earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations 

in addition to the items discussed above earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following 



other income net 

other income net for fiscal 2014  included a 32 million  pretax gain related to the sale of our minority equity interests in two investments 

interest expense net 

the increase in interest expense net for fiscal 2014  and 2013  was primarily due to 13 billion of notes issued in connection with the assuramed acquisition in fiscal 2013  

 

provision for income taxes 

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and us state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation 



fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013 

the fiscal 2014  effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete items of 37 million which reduced the rate by 21 percentage points the discrete items include the favorable impact of the settlement of federal and state tax controversies 80 million and release of valuation allowances 12 million and the unfavorable impact of remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits 65 million primarily as a result of proposed assessments of additional tax 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012 

the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 332 percentage points 295 million due to the nondeductibility of substantially all of the goodwill impairment which was partially offset by the favorable impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings as a result of an agreement with tax authorities 64 million or 72 percentage points 

ongoing audits 

during fiscal 2014  the us internal revenue service irs closed audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2005 the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based upon available capital resources cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures business growth and expansion contractual obligations tax payments and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases if we decide to engage in one or more additional   



acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand and our existing committed credit facilities 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 29 billion  at june 30 2014  compared to 19 billion  at june 30 2013  at june 30 2014  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments 

the increase  in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2014  was driven by net cash provided by operating activities of 25 billion  which was deployed for share repurchases  673 million  acquisitions  519 million  and dividends  415 million  as anticipated net cash provided by operating activities benefited from a net working capital decrease in excess of 500 million as a result of the walgreens contract expiration 

during fiscal 2013  we deployed 22 billion  of cash on acquisitions 450 million  on share repurchases and 353 million  on dividends during fiscal 2013  we received net proceeds from longterm obligations of 981 million  

during fiscal 2012  we deployed 450 million  of cash on share repurchases 300 million  on dividends 260 million  on capital expenditures and 174 million  on acquisitions during fiscal 2012  we received net proceeds from longterm obligations of 290 million  

our working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as customer payments of accounts receivable the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business the decrease in net working capital at june 30 2014  compared to june 30 2013  is primarily a result of the walgreens contract expiration 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2014  included 420 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations as a us parent company we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 

credit facilities and commercial paper 

on october 15 2013  we reduced our committed receivables sales facility program through cardinal health funding llc chf from 950 million  to 700 million  in light of the walgreens contract expiration in addition to our committed receivables sales facility program our sources of liquidity include a 15 billion  revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program of up to 15 billion  backed by the revolving credit facility 

we had no  outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at june 30 2014  and 2013  except for standby letters of credit 

 

of zero and 43 million  at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively we had no  outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at june 30 2014  and 2013  we had no  outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june 30 2014  and 2013  except for standby letters of credit of 41 million  and zero at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of any fiscal quarter end of at least 4to1  and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1  as of june 30 2014  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

availableforsale securities 

during fiscal 2014  we purchased 100 million  of marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale 

longterm obligations and other shortterm borrowings 

at june 30 2014  we had total longterm obligations and other shortterm borrowings of 40 billion  compared to 39 billion  at june 30 2013  

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were 249 million  195 million  and 260 million  respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2015  to be between 335 million to 365 million primarily for growth projects in our core businesses as well as information technology projects 

dividends 

during fiscal 2014  we paid quarterly dividends totaling 121  per share an increase of 18 percent  from fiscal 2013  on may 7 2014 our board of directors approved a 13 percent  increase in our quarterly dividend to 03425  per share or 137  per share on an annualized basis which was paid on july 15 2014 to shareholders of record on july 1 2014 

on august 6 2014 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 03425 per share or 137 per share on an annualized basis payable on october 15 2014 to shareholders of record on october 1 2014 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2014  we repurchased 673 million  of our common shares we funded the repurchases with cash on hand at june 30 2014  we had 727 million  remaining under our current repurchase authorization which expires december 31 2016 on august 6 2014 our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion under this share repurchase program 

interest rate and currency risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and foreign currency forward contracts to protect the 



value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below as well as notes 1 and 12 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2014  

contractual obligations 

at june 30 2014  our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 



  



 

become payable under the joint venture see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us through our distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 137 million  and 134 million  at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 270 days to 5 years  at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and related accrued interest are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 18 million  and 17 million  at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

our methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 



the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and finance notes receivables at june 30 2014  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 6 million  

we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2014  are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue 

inventories 

a substantial portion of our inventories  61 percent  and 65 percent at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals generally tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 

the remaining inventory is stated at the lo wer of cost using the first in first out method or market if we had used the average 

 

cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2014  or 2013  primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have declined over time inventories valued at lifo were 98 million  and 97 million  higher than the average cost value at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2014  and 2013  

inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 44 million  and 40 million  at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names developed technology and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful lives 



goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our home division and home division 

fair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9  to 12 percent  under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of 

 

reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013  concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  testing we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013  if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of these reporting units for fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  as discussed further in note 5 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  we recognized an 829 million   799 million  net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

vendor reserves were 82 million  and 66 million  at june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively approximately 68 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2014  pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 60 percent at the end of fiscal 2013  the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations 



of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

loss contingencies 

we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 9 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding loss contingencies 

provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



 expiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 

 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent  likely of being realized upon settlement see note 8 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective income tax rate by 1 percent would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease 18 million  for fiscal 2014

sharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange interest rate and commodity pricerelated changes we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk see notes 1 and 12 of the “notes to consolidated 



financial statements” for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

by nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature principal drivers of this foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar thai baht mexican peso chinese renminbi european euro japanese yen singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 

transactional exposure 

transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries as part of our risk management program at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year these analyses include the estimated impact of our hedging program which mitigates transactional exposure at june 30 2014  and 2013  we had hedged approximately 48 and 45 percent of transactional exposures respectively the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to transactional exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease at june 30 



translational exposure 

we have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency we perform a similar analysis to that described above related to this translational exposure we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june 30 2014  and 2013  the following table summarizes translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening or weakening in the us dollar at june 30 



interest rate sensitivity 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund operations the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by 

 

management we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 

as part of our risk management program we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates at june 30 2014  and 2013  the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 4 million and 2 million respectively 

during fiscal 2014  we purchased marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale and are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets the fair value is subject to change primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness at june 30 2014  a hypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates would cause a potential decrease of up to 1 million in the estimated fair value 

commodity price sensitivity 

we are exposed to market price changes for commodities including oilbased resins cotton latex and diesel fuel we typically purchase raw materials at market prices and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year our forecasted commodity exposure at june 30 2014  decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of commodity prices and changes in purchasing volumes 

at june 30 2014  and 2013  we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note 12 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in commodity prices at june 30 



we also are exposed to fluctuations in commodities prices through the purchase of finished goods and various other energyrelated commodities including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business where our contracts are not directly tied to a commodity index we believe our total gross range of exposure to commodities including the items listed in the table above is 400 million to 500 million at june 30 2014

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

pharmaceutical segment 

in the united states including puerto rico the pharmaceutical segment 

 in china the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded generic and specialty pharmaceuticals overthecounter and consumer products as well as provides logistics marketing and other services and operates specialty pharmacies through cardinal health china 

pharmaceutical distribution 

our pharmaceutical distribution division generates gross margin when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost 

 

of products sold net of cash discounts gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs and margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs includes price discounts and rebates and may include price appreciation on some products our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time although this may vary margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers and also includes benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciation 

bulk and nonbulk sales 

the pharmaceutical segment historically has differentiated between bulk and nonbulk sales based on the nature of our customers’ operations when presenting information on the segments operations the table below shows the pharmaceutical segments revenue segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk sales 



 bulk sales consisted of sales to retail chain customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses in the united states all other sales were classified as nonbulk sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer were classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and nonbulk sales with respect to its retail stores 

substantially all bulk sales consisted of products shipped in the same form that we received them from the manufacturer a small portion of bulk sales were broken down into smaller units prior to shipping in contrast nonbulk sales required more complex servicing for nonbulk sales we may have received inventory in large or full case quantities and broken it down into smaller quantities warehoused the product for a longer period of time picked individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivered that smaller order to a customer location 

bulk sales generated significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales customers received lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than nonbulk sales as bulk sales required fewer services to be provided to these customers and hence less costs were incurred by us in providing these products in addition bulk sales in the aggregate generated higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales due to the mix of products sold 



within the bulk category segment distribution selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales were substantially lower than from nonbulk sales because bulk sales required substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than nonbulk sales 

in light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co walgreens we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future as such in the future we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and nonbulk sales to investors 

specialty pharmaceutical products and services 

we refer to products and services offered by our specialty solutions division as “specialty pharmaceutical products and services” the specialty solutions division currently 1 distributes oncology rheumatology urology and other pharmaceutical products specialty pharmaceutical products to physician offices 2 distributes human plasma products and some specialty pharmaceutical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers 3 provides various consulting and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers thirdparty payors and healthcare providers primarily supporting the marketing distribution and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products and 4 operates a specialty pharmacy our use of the terminology specialty pharmaceutical products and services may not be comparable to the use of that terminology by other industry participants

customers 

our largest customers cvs caremark corporation “cvs” and walgreens accounted for approximately 23 percent  and 20 percent  respectively of our fiscal 2013 revenue in the aggregate our five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 52 percent  of our fiscal 2013 revenue in march 2013 we announced that our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens which expires at the end of august 2013 would not be renewed our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts inc express scripts which was our third largest customer in fiscal 2012 expired in september 2012 

in addition we have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 13 percent  of our revenue in fiscal 2013 



suppliers 

we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 25 percent of our revenue during fiscal 2013 but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 6 percent of that revenue overall we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good 

the pharmaceutical distribution division is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these agreements generally have terms ranging from one year with an automatic renewal feature to five years generally these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree if there is an uncured breach of the agreement or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 

competition

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

regulatory matters

prescription drug pedigree tracking and supply chain integrity 

there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system also known as pedigree tracking” the us house of representatives passed a pedigree tracking bill in june 2013 that would initially establish a lotbased pedigree tracking system some states also have adopted or are considering adopting pedigree tracking laws for example effective july 2016 california will require that pharmaceutical wholesalers implement electronic trackandtrace capabilities for pharmaceutical products

although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands 



but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in item 1 business above we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as effective sourcing and enhanced cost control measures our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate further consolidation among our customers and suppliers including branded pharmaceutical manufacturers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may adversely impact our results of operations 

cvs caremark corporation is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs accounted for approximately 23 percent  of our fiscal 2013  revenue and 19 percent  of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2013 while we recently renewed our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with cvs i f cvs does not renew its contracts with us in the future or terminates its contracts early defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases of our products our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected our contract with walgreens will expire in august 2013 

 

and sales to walgreens accounted for approximately 20 percent of our fiscal 2013 revenue we expect the expiration of the walgreens contract to have an adverse impact on our results of operations as discussed below in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our pharmaceutical segments margin may be affected by fewer or less profitable generic pharmaceutical launches prices established by manufacturers and other factors that are beyond our control 

as described in greater detail in item 1 business above margin in our pharmaceutical segment consists in part of margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation 

the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches varies from year to year and the margin impact of new launches varies from product to product fewer generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those previously experienced will have an adverse effect on our yearoveryear margins additionally prices for existing generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time although this may vary price deflation on existing generic pharmaceuticals will have an adverse effect on our margins 

with respect to branded pharmaceutical price appreciation if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by amounts that are smaller than have been experienced historically we will earn less margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements 

the us healthcare environment is changing in many ways some of which may not be favorable to us 

the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety contain costs and increase efficiencies medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined the use of managed care has increased distributors manufacturers healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and have formed strategic alliances and large purchasing groups are prevalent the industry also has experienced a shift away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics and office settings and in some cases patients’ homes 

with respect to cost containment the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act enacted in march 2010 have provisions designed to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including changing the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than 175 percent of the average weighted manufacturers price for generic pharmaceuticals the centers for medicare and medicaid services is also considering providing states with alternatives to traditional reimbursement measures 

we could be adversely affected directly or indirectly if our customers are adversely affected by these and other changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical devices or healthcare services 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated as described in greater detail in item 1 business above we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in china and other foreign countries if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and 



financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to hold permits licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of governmental bodies failure to maintain or renew necessary permits licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

products that we manufacture source distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product recalls or seizures or criminal and civil sanctions 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments which could result in civil and criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the requirements of these laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices which may adversely affect our operations results of operations and financial condition 

assuramed is a medicarecertified supplier with respect to a small portion of its business its failure to comply with medicare supplier standards and billing requirements could result in civil and criminal sanctions including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with a contractual or other requirement may result in qui tam actions monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition our government contracts could be terminated and we could be suspended or debarred from government contract work 

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act chinese anticorruption and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and with us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with any of these laws we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions 

our china operations are subject to national regional and local regulations the regulatory environment in china is evolving and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations it is possible that the chinese governments current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our china operations result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states such as the repeal of lastin firstout lifo treatment of inventory or a change in the current us taxation of 

 

income earned by foreign subsidiaries that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition 

the carefusion spinoff may have unexpected tax consequences 

in connection with the august 2009 carefusion spinoff we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” in addition we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the carefusion spinoff would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel similarly the irs could determine on audit that the carefusion spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons if the carefusion spinoff is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 

we rely on information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities or our customers access to them are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events cyber security incidents or other actions of third parties or fail for any extended period of time 

in addition data security breaches could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements including those related to patientidentifiable health information 



because of the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings for instance some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections we also may be named in breach of contract claims or qui tam  actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations 

acquisitions can have unanticipated results 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets or we may encounter unforeseen accounting internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural disasters or could be terminated a sustained supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years so costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations are subject to economic political and currency risks 

our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition political changes also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location we may not be able to hedge or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks and any hedges or insurance may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 

 

economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services  

deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and therefore reduce purchases of our products and services by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are referring to our continuing operations 

overview 

we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies hospitals ambulatory surgery centers clinical laboratories physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs enhancing efficiency and improving quality we also provide medical products to patients in the home 

we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 

during fiscal 2013  revenue decreased 6 percent  to 1011 billion  largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts and the impact of brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions 

gross margin increased 8 percent  to 49 billion  reflecting strong performance in our pharmaceutical segment generic programs operating earnings decreased 44 percent  to 10 billion  and earnings from continuing operations decreased 69 percent  to 335 million  due to an 829 million   799 million  net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division 

our cash and equivalents balance was 19 billion  at june 30 2013  compared to 23 billion  at june 30 2012  the decrease  in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2013  was driven by acquisitions of 22 billion  share repurchases of 450 million  and dividends of 353 million  offset by strong net cash provided by operating activities of 17 billion  and net proceeds from longterm obligations of 981 million  we plan to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value 

large customers 

on april 25 2013 we announced the renewal of our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with cvs cvs accounted for approximately 23 percent  of our fiscal 2013  revenue 

our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens will expire at the end of august 2013 because sales to walgreens generated approximately 20 percent  of our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2013  we expect the expiration of this contract to have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are taking steps to reduce our costs and otherwise mitigate the impact of the expiration of the walgreens contract in fiscal 2014 and afterward largely as a result of the contract expiration we do not currently expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 excluding the effects in both periods of restructuring and employee severance costs acquisitionrelated costs and credits impairments and gains and losses on disposal of assets including the 829 million nuclear pharmacy services division goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013 net litigation recoveries and charges and charges and tax benefits associated with each of these items after the expiration of this contract we also anticipate 

 

a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by reduced accounts payable based on the expected working capital decrease and other factors we anticipate that the expiration of the walgreens contract will result in a net aftertax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2014 in excess of 500 million 

goodwill 

in conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 we recently completed our annual goodwill impairment test which we perform annually in the fourth quarter as part of this annual test we concluded that the entire goodwill amount of our nuclear pharmacy services division was impaired resulting in a noncash impairment charge of 829 million 799 million net of tax this impairment charge does not impact our liquidity cash flows from operations or compliance with debt covenants 

the majority of the goodwill of our nuclear pharmacy services division was acquired through our acquisition of syncor international corporation in fiscal 2003 681 million of goodwill excluding the impact of the impairment charge we have a total of approximately 10 billion of invested capital in our nuclear pharmacy services division inclusive of the syncor acquisition accumulated over the past 12 years 

as previously disclosed in our quarterly reports on form 10q for the quarters ended december 31 2012 and march 31 2013 our nuclear pharmacy services division has experienced significant softness in the lowenergy diagnostics market during the second half of fiscal 2013 we experienced sustained volume declines and price erosion for the core lowenergy products provided by this division in addition we experienced reduced sales for some existing highenergy diagnostic products slowerthanexpected adoption of new highenergy diagnostic products and recent reimbursement developments that may adversely impact the future growth of these products using this information we adjusted our outlook and longterm business plans for this division during our annual budgeting process which we recently concluded this update resulted in significant reductions in the anticipated future cash flows and estimated fair value for this reporting unit see note 5 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

restructuring 

on january 30 2013 we announced a restructuring plan within our medical segment under this restructuring plan we are moving production of procedure kits from our facility in waukegan illinois to other facilities and selling property and consolidating office space in waukegan illinois in addition we reorganized our medical segment and plan to sell our sterilization processes in el paso texas we estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately 79 million  on a pretax basis of which 51 million  was recognized during fiscal 2013  of the estimated 28 million  remaining costs to be recognized through the end of fiscal 2014 we estimate that approximately 3 million  will be employeerelated costs 11 million  will be facility exit and other costs and 14 million  will be an expected loss on disposal of the property in waukegan illinois described above we have evaluated this property and have determined that at june 30 2013 it does not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale the costs recognized during 2013 are classified as restructuring and employee severance and impairments and loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statements of earnings we 



expect to start realizing cost savings and other benefits from the plan in fiscal 2014 

acquisitions 

on march 18 2013  we completed the acquisition of assuramed for 207 billion  net of cash acquired in an allcash transaction we funded the acquisition through the issuance of 13 billion  in fixed rate notes and cash on hand the acquisition of assuramed a provider of medical supplies to homecare providers and patients in the home expands our ability to serve this patient base we expect the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets to be a significant expense in future periods excluding the impact of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets this acquisition had a positive impact on operating earnings in fiscal 2013 and we expect it to have a positive impact on operating earnings in future periods see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on the assuramed acquisition 

other trends 

within our pharmaceutical segment we expect continued strength in our generic pharmaceutical programs as well as continued price appreciation from branded pharmaceutical products in fiscal 2014 

within our medical segment variability in the cost of commodities such as oilbased resins cotton latex diesel fuel and other commodities can have a significant impact on cost of products sold although commodity prices fluctuate we do not expect changes in commodity prices to have a significant impact on our yearoveryear results of operations in fiscal 2014 we also expect a continuation of relatively flat proceduralbased utilization in fiscal 2014 

results of operations 

revenue 



fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

pharmaceutical segment 

revenue for fiscal 2013  compared to the prior year was negatively impacted by the expiration on september 30 2012 of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts approximately 67 billion the revenue from which was classified as bulk sales revenue from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers decreased by approximately 36 billion primarily as a result of brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenue because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding brand product and because some of our customers primarily source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than from us the decrease was partially offset by increased pharmaceutical distribution revenue from new customers approximately 38 billion and revenue growth within our specialty solutions division 961 million 

 

revenue from bulk sales was 298 billion and 402 billion for fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively bulk sales for fiscal 2013  decreased by 26 percent driven primarily by the expiration of our contract with express scripts and brandtogeneric conversions revenue from nonbulk sales was 613 billion and 577 billion for fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively nonbulk sales for fiscal 2013  increased by 6 percent driven by growth from new customers see “item 1 business” for more information about bulk and nonbulk sales in light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future as such in the future we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and nonbulk sales to investors 

medical segment 

revenue for fiscal 2013  compared to the prior year reflects the benefit of acquisitions 459 million 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

pharmaceutical segment 

revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2012  compared to the prior year by acquisitions 23 billion and increased sales to existing customers 20 billion 

medical segment 

revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2012  compared to the prior year by increased volume from existing customers 335 million including the positive impact from sales of selfmanufactured and private brand products and the transition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  of our relationship with carefusion from a feeforservice arrangement to a traditional distribution model 131 million 

cost of products sold 

consistent with the change in revenue cost of products sold decreased   68 billion   7 percent  during fiscal 2013  and increased  by 45 billion   5 percent  during fiscal 2012  see the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold 

gross margin 



fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

gross margin increased in fiscal 2013  compared to the prior year driven by strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs 350 million and acquisitions 131 million increased margin from branded pharmaceutical distribution agreements exclusive of the related volume impact also had a positive impact on gross margin 81 million pricing changes including rebates exclusive of the related volume impact adversely impacted gross margin 211 million driven in part by customer and product mix the adverse impact of these pricing changes is offset by sourcing programs and other sources of margin as a result of significant market softness gross margin from our nuclear pharmacy services division decreased by 71 million in fiscal 2013  

the cost of oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities used in our medical segment selfmanufactured products had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin as described above while the expiration of the 



express scripts contract resulted in lower revenue it had a slightly unfavorable impact on gross margin 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

gross margin increased in fiscal 2012  compared to the prior year primarily due to strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs 344 million including the impact of new product launches and price appreciation on a few specific products and acquisitions 137 million favorable medical segment product sales mix and increased sales volume resulted in a 100 million favorable impact to gross margin pricing changes including rebates exclusive of the related volume impact adversely impacted gross margin 205 million the adverse impact of these pricing changes was offset by sourcing programs and other sources of margin increased cost of oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities used in our medical segment selfmanufactured products decreased gross margin by 66 million 

distribution selling general and administrative sga expenses 



sga expenses increased  during 2013  over fiscal 2012  primarily due to acquisitions 84 million and investment spending 17 million 

increased sga expenses in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 were primarily due to acquisitions 65 million and business system investments including the medical segment business transformation project 

segment profit and consolidated operating earnings 



segment profit 

we evaluate segment performance based upon segment profit among other measures segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold less segment sga expenses we do not allocate restructuring and employee severance acquisitionrelated costs impairments and loss on disposal of assets litigation recoveriescharges net certain investment and other spending to our segments these costs are retained at corporate investment spending generally includes the first year spend for certain projects that require incremental investments in the form of additional operating expenses we encourage our segments to identify investment projects that will promote innovation and provide future returns as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management the expenses for such projects are often retained at corporate see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 

 

pharmaceutical segment profit 

the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012 were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical distribution agreements these benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution pricing changes and significant market softness in our nuclear pharmacy services division 

the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs including the impact of new product launches and the positive impact of acquisitions offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution pricing changes 

segment profit from bulk sales decreased 36 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and was 7 percent and 10 percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively segment profit from nonbulk sales increased 212 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 and was 93 percent and 90 percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively the generic pharmaceutical programs discussed above primarily impacted segment profit from nonbulk sales 

medical segment profit 

the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012 were the positive impact of acquisitions and decreased cost of commodities used in our selfmanufactured products partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pricing changes driven in part by customer and product mix segment profit was also moderated by softness in proceduralbased utilization the 23 percent excise tax on certain manufactured or imported medical devices that became effective january 1 2013 had a slightly unfavorable impact on segment profit 

the principal drivers for the decrease in fiscal 2012  over fiscal 2011 were the increased cost of commodities used in our selfmanufactured products and an increase in sga expenses including the impact of business system investments these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product sales mix and increased net sales volume 

corporate 

as discussed further below the principal driver for the decrease in corporate in fiscal 2013  was an 829 million  noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division in addition to other costs not allocated to our segments 

consolidated operating earnings 

in addition to revenue gross margin and sga expenses discussed above operating earnings were impacted by the following 





restructuring and employee severance 

in addition to other restructuring activities during fiscal 2013  we recognized 30 million  of employeerelated costs and 10 million  of facility exit and other costs related to the restructuring within our medical segment we also recognized 11 million  of employeerelated costs as part of a restructuring plan within our nuclear pharmacy services division during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  

acquisitionrelated costs 

acquisitionrelated costs for fiscal 2013  included transaction costs associated with the purchase of assuramed  20 million  additionally amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 118 million  78 million  and 67 million for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in amortization during fiscal 2013  was primarily due to intangible assets from the acquisition of assuramed 

acquisitionrelated costs for fiscal 2012  included income recognized upon adjustment of the contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with the p4 healthcare acquisition  71 million  in early fiscal 2013  we terminated and settled the remaining contingent consideration obligation for 4 million  

impairments and loss on disposal of assets 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  we recognized an 829 million   799 million  net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division as discussed further in the overview section and in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in connection with our medical segment restructuring plan discussed in note 3 during fiscal 2013  we recognized an 11 million  loss to write down our gamma sterilization assets in el paso texas to the estimated fair value less costs to sell also during fiscal 2013  we recorded an 8 million  writeoff of commercial software under development within our pharmaceutical segment in connection with our decision to discontinue this project 

during fiscal 2012  we recorded a charge of 16 million  to write off an indefinitelife intangible asset related to the p4 healthcare trade name 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2013  we recognized 38 million  of income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member 

earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations 

in addition to the items discussed above earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following 



 

interest expense net 

the increase in interest expense net for fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012  was primarily due to 13 billion  of notes issued in connection with the assuramed acquisition 

gain on sale of investment in carefusion 

we recognized 75 million  of income during fiscal 2011  related to the sale of our investment in carefusion common stock 

provision for income taxes 

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and united states state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation 



fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

the fiscal 2013  effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 332 percentage points 295 million due to the nondeductibility of substantially all of the goodwill impairment which was partially offset by the favorable impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings as a result of an agreement with tax authorities 64 million or 72 percentage points 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011   

the fiscal 2012  effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a settlement of the fiscal 2001 and 2002 irs audits 40 million or 24  percentage points the yearoveryear comparison of the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the release in fiscal 2011  of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance 

ongoing audits 

the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2010 we have received proposed adjustments from the irs for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries the irs has proposed additional taxes of 399 million  excluding penalties and interest if this tax ultimately must be paid carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the carefusion spinoff for 142 million  of the total amount we disagree with these proposed adjustments which we are contesting and have accounted for the unrecognized tax benefits related to them the irs had also proposed additional taxes of 450 million  excluding penalties and interest related to the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us for which carefusion would be liable under the tax matters agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 carefusion settled 



this matter with the irs we have adjusted the indemnification receivable that we had recorded for this matter the settlement has no net impact on our provision for income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based upon available capital resources cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures business growth and expansion contractual obligations payments for tax settlements and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases during fiscal 2013 we completed the acquisition of assuramed which we funded through the issuance of 13 billion  in fixed rate notes and cash on hand in addition to several other small acquisitions which we funded with cash on hand if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 19 billion  at june 30 2013  compared to 23 billion  at june 30 2012  at june 30 2013  our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments the decrease  in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2013  was driven by acquisitions of 22 billion  share repurchases of 450 million  and dividends of 353 million  offset by strong net cash provided by operating activities of 17 billion  and net proceeds from longterm obligations of 981 million  net cash provided by operating activities of 17 billion  was driven primarily by increased gross margin product mix and working capital changes as expected this increase was partially offset by the adverse impact of cash tax payments and the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts 

during fiscal 2012  we deployed 450 million  of cash on share repurchases 300 million  on dividends 263 million  on capital expenditures and 174 million  on acquisitions during fiscal 2012  we received net proceeds from longterm obligations of 290 million 

during fiscal 2011  we deployed 23 billion  of cash on acquisitions 291 million  on capital expenditures 274 million  on dividends and 270 million  on share repurchases during fiscal 2011  we received 706 million  in proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in carefusion common stock 

we use days sales outstanding “dso” days inventory on hand “dioh” and days payable outstanding “dpo” to evaluate our working capital performance dso is calculated as trade receivables net divided by quarterly revenue divided by 90 days dioh is calculated as inventories net divided by quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings divided by 90 days dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings divided by 90 days chargeback billings are the difference between a product’s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price chargeback billings were 43 billion  40 billion  and 36 billion for fiscal 2013 2012  and 2011  respectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we changed our method of calculating dso in order to align it with the 90day convention that we use in the calculation of dioh and dpo prior to this change we calculated dso by dividing trade receivables net by monthly revenue divided by 30 days in connection with this change we have 

 

revised prioryear information to conform to the new method of calculating dso 



changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors in the regular course of business 

dso and dioh increased in fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012  primarily as a result of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts dpo increased primarily due to the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts and brandtogeneric conversions 

dso increased in fiscal 2012  over fiscal 2011 due to the implementation of our medical segments business transformation project which led to an increase in trade receivables at june 30 2012  dioh increased in fiscal 2012  as a result of inventory increases related to onboarding a new pharmaceutical customer and our medical segments business transformation project implementation 

the cash and equivalents balance at june 30 2013  included 428 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations as a us parent company we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 

after the expiration of the walgreens contract in fiscal 2014 we anticipate a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by reduced accounts payable based on the expected working capital decrease and other factors we anticipate that the expiration of the walgreens contract will result in a net aftertax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2014  in excess of 500 million 

credit facilities and commercial paper 

our sources of liquidity include a 15 billion  revolving credit facility and a 950 million  committed receivables sales facility program at times availability under our committed receivables sales facility program may be less than 950 million  based on receivables concentration limits and our outstanding eligible receivables balance we also have a commercial paper program of up to 15 billion  backed by the revolving credit facility 

we had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june 30 2013  and 2012  we also had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at june 30 2013  and 2012  except for 43 million and 44 million  respectively of standby letters of credit for each year our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of any fiscal quarter end of at least 4to1  and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1  as of june 30 2013  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

on november 6 2012  we renewed our 950 million  committed 



receivables sales facility program until november 6 2014  following the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens we expect that availability under our committed receivables sales facility program will be less than 950 million based on our then outstanding eligible receivables balance on june 4 2013  we extended the term of our 15 billion  revolving credit facility to june 4 2018  

longterm obligations 

as of june 30 2013 we had total longterm obligations of 39 billion compared to 29 billion at june 30 2012 on february 19 2013 we sold in a registered offering 400 million aggregate principal amount of 17 notes that mature on march 15 2018 550 million aggregate principal amount of 32 notes that mature on march 15 2023 and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 46 notes that mature on march 15 2043 

we used cash on hand to repay 300 million of our 55  notes that were due on june 15 2013  

funding of assuramed acquisition 

we funded the acquisition of assuramed through the issuance of 13 billion in the notes described above and cash on hand we obtained a commitment letter in february 2013 from certain financial institutions for a 13 billion unsecured bridge term loan facility that could have been used to complete the acquisition we incurred fees of 5 million related to the facility which are included in interest expense net no amounts were drawn under the facility and we terminated the commitment letter in connection with the notes offering 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2013    2012  and 2011  were 195 million  263 million  and 291 million  respectively which were primarily related to information technology projects 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  to be between 245 million and 265 million 

dividends 

during fiscal 2013  we paid quarterly dividends totaling 1025  per share an increase of 19 percent  from fiscal 2012  on may 1 2013 our board of directors approved a 10 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to 03025 per share or 121 per share on an annualized basis payable on july 15 2013 to shareholders of record on july 1 2013 

on august 7 2013 our board of directors approved our 116th consecutive regular quarterly dividend payable to shareholders of record on october 1 2013 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2013  we repurchased 450 million  of our common shares we funded the repurchases with cash on hand at june 30 2013  we had 400 million  remaining under our current repurchase authorization which expires august 31 2015 

interest rate and currency risk management 

we use interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and commodity swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below as well as notes 1 and 11 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding 

 

the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements at june 30 2013 

contractual obligations 

at june 30 2013  our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 



  

 recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and 



assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us through our distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 134 million  and 126 million  at june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 120 days to 7 years  at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 17 million  and 16 million  at june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

our methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 

the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and finance notes receivables at june 30 2013  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 6 million  

we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2013  are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue 

inventories 

a substantial portion of our inventories  65 percent  and 69 percent at june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price 

 

appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time so our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time so our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 

the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the first in first out method or market if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2013  or 2012  primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline inventories valued at lifo were 97 million  and 72 million  higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2013  and 2012  

inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 40 million  and 37 million  at june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trade names and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of 



operations see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful lives 

goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our assuramed division and assuramed division 

fair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9 to 12 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments 

 

that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our fiscal 2013 and 2012 testing we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of these reporting units for fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 as discussed further in note 5 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an 829 million  799 million net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

vendor reserves were 66 million  and 75 million  at june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively approximately 60 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2013  pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 79 percent at the end of fiscal 2012  the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 



deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30 



 expiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent  likely of being realized upon settlement see note 7 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 

 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective income tax rate by 1 percent would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease 9 million  for fiscal 2013  

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange interest rate and commodity pricerelated changes we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk see notes 1 and 11 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

by nature of our global operations our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature principal drivers of this foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro mexican peso thai baht malaysian ringgit and japanese yen 

transactional exposure 

our businesses transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries as part of our risk management program at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year these analyses include the estimated impact of our hedging program which mitigates our businesses transactional exposure at both june 30 2013 and 2012 we had hedged approximately 45 percent of our businesses transactional exposures the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to our businesses transactional exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease at june 30 



translational exposure 

we have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency we perform a similar analysis to that described above related to this translational exposure we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june 30 2013 and 2012 the following table summarizes our businesses translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening or weakening in the us dollar at june 30 



interest rate sensitivity 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements market 

 

conditions and other factors our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 

as part of our risk management program we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates at both june 30 2013 and 2012 the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 2 million 

commodity price sensitivity 

we are exposed to market price changes for commodities including oilbased resins cotton latex and diesel fuel we typically purchase raw materials at market prices and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year our forecasted commodity exposure at june 30 2013 decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of commodity prices and changes in purchasing volumes 

at june 30 2013 and 2012 we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note 11 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in commodity prices at june 30 



we also are exposed to fluctuations in commodities prices through the purchase of finished goods and various other energyrelated commodities including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business where our contracts are not directly tied to a commodity index we believe our total gross range of exposure to commodities including the items listed in the table above is 500 million to 600 million at june 30 2013 






 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we evaluated with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act as of june 30 2013 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2013 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also controls deemed effective now may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions or because compliance with the policies or procedures has deteriorated or been circumvented 

 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013 in making this assessment management used the criteria established in the internal controlintegrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso criteria” based on management’s assessment and the coso criteria management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2013 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report appears following item 9a and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

on march 18 2013 we completed the acquisition of assuramed as permitted by guidelines established by the sec management excluded assuramed from the scope of its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013 assuramed constituted 9 percent  and 35 percent of our total and net assets respectively as of june 30 2013 and less than 1 percent of both our revenue and operating earnings for the fiscal year then ended 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 



report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of cardinal health inc 

we have audited cardinal health inc and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013  based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria cardinal health inc and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “managements report on internal control over financial reporting” our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying “managements report on internal control over financial reporting” managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control of assuramed inc which is included in the 2013 consolidated financial statements of cardinal health inc and subsidiaries and constituted 9 percent  and 35 percent of total and net assets respectively as of june 30 2013  and less than 1 percent of both revenue and operating earnings for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of   cardinal health inc   and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of assuramed inc 

in our opinion cardinal health inc   and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013  based on   the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of cardinal health inc and subsidiaries   as of june 30 2013  and 2012  and the related consolidated statements of earnings comprehensive income shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30 2013  of cardinal health inc and subsidiaries and our report dated august 20 2013  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon 








 item 9b other information 

on august 20 2013 the human resources and compensation committee the “committee” of our board of directors approved fiscal 2013 cash incentive compensation awards for our named executive officers the committee approved the awards based on ebit adjusted nongaap operating earnings and tangible capital performance under a payout matrix established by the committee at the beginning of fiscal 2013 as well as segment and individual performance for purposes of qualifying payments as performancebased compensation under section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 the committee also had established the performance criterion of 8 return on shareholders equity calculated on a gaap basis or gaap roe under the management incentive plan mip for cash incentive awards to executive officers because we did not achieve gaap roe of 8 for fiscal 2013 due to the 829 million   799 million  net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division we could not pay these awards under the mip as a result the awards paid to our named executive officers who are covered persons under section 162m will be subject to the limits on deductibility under section 162m generally section 162m prevents us from taking a tax deduction for nonperformancebased compensation in excess of 1 million paid in any fiscal year to our chief executive officer and three other most highly compensated executive officers other than the chief financial officer the federal tax impact of the award amounts for which we will not claim a deduction is insignificant

pharmaceutical segment 

in the united states including puerto rico the pharmaceutical segment 

 in china the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded generic and specialty pharmaceuticals overthecounter and consumer products as well as provides logistics marketing and other services through cardinal health china 

 

pharmaceutical distribution 

our pharmaceutical distribution business generates gross margin primarily when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold net of cash discounts generic manufacturer margin and margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements cash discounts are price reductions that manufacturers may offer to us for prompt payment of purchased products generic manufacturer margin refers to price discounts rebates and other consideration that we receive under our agreements with manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time although this may vary margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers in addition margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements may include benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciation which occurs when a manufacturer increases its published price for a product after we have purchased that product for inventory 

bulk and nonbulk sales 

the pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk sales based on the nature of our customers’ operations bulk sales consist of sales to retail chain customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses in the united states all other sales are classified as nonbulk sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer are classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and nonbulk sales with respect to its retail stores 

substantially all bulk sales consist of products shipped in the same form that we receive them from the manufacturer a small portion of bulk sales are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping in contrast nonbulk sales require more complex servicing for nonbulk sales we may receive inventory in large or full case quantities and break it down into smaller quantities warehouse the product for a longer period of time pick individual products specific to a customer’s order and deliver that smaller order to a customer location 

bulk sales generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales customers receive lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than nonbulk sales as bulk sales require less services to be provided to these customers and hence less costs are incurred by us in providing these products in addition bulk sales in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales due to the mix of products sold within the bulk category segment distribution selling general and administrative “sga” expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales are substantially lower than from nonbulk sales because bulk sales require substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than nonbulk sales 

the following table shows the revenues segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk sales for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  



 specialty pharmaceutical products and services 

we refer to products and services offered by our specialty solutions division as “specialty pharmaceutical products and services” the specialty solutions division currently 1 distributes oncology rheumatology and other pharmaceutical products to physician offices 2 distributes human plasma products and some limiteddistribution pharmaceutical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers and 3 provides various consulting and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers thirdparty payors and healthcare providers primarily supporting the marketing distribution and payment for these products our use of this terminology may not be comparable to the use by other industry participants

acquisitions and divestitures 

in the past five fiscal years we completed the following three significant acquisitions apart from businesses spunoff as part of carefusion corporation “carefusion” as presented below 



 

in addition we completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years including purchasing borschow hospital  medical supplies inc in fiscal 2009 and futuremed healthcare products corporation in fiscal 2012 

during the past five fiscal years we also completed several divestitures including selling our united kingdombased martindale injectable manufacturing business in fiscal 2010 in addition effective august 31 2009 we separated our clinical and medical products businesses through distribution to our shareholders of 81 percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion the “spinoff” during fiscal 2010 we disposed of 11 million shares of carefusion common stock and during fiscal 2011 we disposed of the remaining 30 million shares enturia inc a significant acquisition that was made in fiscal 2008 was spunoff as part of carefusion 

customers 

our largest customers cvs caremark corporation “cvs” and walgreen co “walgreens” accounted for approximately 22 percent and 21 percent respectively of our fiscal 2012 revenue the aggregate of our five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 59 percent of our fiscal 2012 revenue our contracts with cvs and walgreens are currently scheduled to expire in june 2013 and august 2013 respectively in august 2012 walgreens issued a request for proposal for pharmaceutical distribution services for the threeyear period beginning after the expiration of our contract with walgreens in the ordinary course of our business we frequently are in a competitive bid or request for proposal process for pharmaceutical distribution and other business of a customer or potential customer 

in april 2012 express scripts inc one of our pharmaceutical distribution customers merged with medco health solutions inc which was a pharmaceutical distribution customer of a competitor in april 2012 the combined company issued a request for proposal for its combined pharmaceutical distribution business in july 2012 express scripts inc informed us that it had not awarded the combined contract to us our current pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts inc expires on september 30 2012 and provided approximately 90 billion of revenue in fiscal 2012 all of which is classified as bulk sales express scripts inc was our third largest customer in fiscal 2012 

in addition we have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 13 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2012 

suppliers 

we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 28 percent of our revenue during fiscal 2012 but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 7 percent of that revenue overall we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good 

the pharmaceutical distribution business is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these agreements generally have terms ranging from one year with an automatic renewal feature to five years generally these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree if there is an uncured breach of the agreement or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 

 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products we compete on many levels including service offerings support services breadth of product lines and price 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with national fullline wholesale distributors including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation regional wholesale distributors including hd smith and morris  dickson co llc selfwarehousing chains direct selling manufacturers specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies including united parcel service inc and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers 

in the medical segment we compete with many different distributors including owens  minor inc thermo fisher scientific inc pss world medical inc henry schein inc and medline industries inc in addition we compete with regional medical products distributors thirdparty logistics companies and manufacturers’ direct distribution competitors of the medical segment’s manufacturing and procedural kit businesses include kimberlyclark corporation ansell limited deroyal industries inc medline industries inc professional hospital supply and medical action industries 

employees 

as of june 30 2012 we had approximately 23300 employees in the united states and approximately 9200 employees outside of the united states overall we consider our employee relations to be good 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents relating to the distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings and relating to medical and surgical products such as fluid suction and irrigation devices surgical waste management systems surgical and medical examination gloves surgical drapes gowns and facial protection products and patient temperature management products we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 

we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are subject to thirdparty infringement claims while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

regulatory matters 

our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon their specific business our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal they can suspend our ability to distribute products or can initiate product recalls they can seize products or impose criminal civil and administrative sanctions and they can seek injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products 

distribution 

the fda dea and various state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various state and federal statutes including the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the federal controlled substances act the csa wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the csa which governs the sale packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances as further discussed in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on may 14 2012 we entered into a settlement agreement with the dea pursuant to which our lakeland florida pharmaceutical distribution centers registration to distribute controlled substances will be suspended until may 15 2014 during this suspension our lakeland facility will continue to distribute pharmaceutical products other than controlled substances while controlled substances will be shipped to customers from our other distribution centers 

our pharmaceutical segment’s china distribution operations are subject to similar national regional and local regulations including licensing and regulatory requirements of the china ministry of health ministry of commerce ministry of finance the state food and drug administration and the general administration of customs 

manufacturing and marketing 

our subsidiaries that manufacture and source medical devices are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable foreign agencies including regulations regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices and quality systems 

 

the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling promotion and advertising distribution importation and postmarket surveillance of some of our manufactured products we need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities before we can market and sell many of our products in particular countries even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory review 

to assess and facilitate compliance with federal state and foreign regulatory requirements we routinely review our quality and compliance systems to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify areas for improvement or remediation as part of our quality review we assess the suppliers of raw materials components and finished goods that are incorporated into the medical devices we manufacture in addition we conduct quality management reviews designed to highlight key issues that may affect the quality of our products and services 

from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action such as withdrawing the product from the market correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers for example in august 2011 the fda notified us that it was halting entry into the united states of all presource® procedure kits that we assemble in mexico and import through el paso texas the fda indicated that we had not supplied adequate documentary support for certain components of these procedure kits but did not indicate any concerns about patient safety in response to the fdas concerns we took remedial actions and have resumed importing procedure kits 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 

our nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations from the nrc applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate in addition our cyclotron facilities must comply with the fdas good manufacturing practices regulations for positron emission tomography “pet” drugs that became effective in december 2011 

prescription drug pedigree tracking and supply chain integrity 

the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards to identify and validate technologies for securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices in march 2010 the fda issued guidance establishing standardized numerical identifiers for prescription pharmaceutical packages some states also have adopted or are considering adopting pedigree tracking laws for example effective july 2016 california will require that pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers implement electronic trackandtrace capabilities for pharmaceutical products 

healthcare fraud and abuse laws 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws these laws generally prohibit companies from soliciting offering receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order or purchase items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other united states governmentsponsored healthcare programs they also prohibit submitting or causing to be submitted any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties as well as claims under the federal false claims act and similar state acts under which private persons may file suit on behalf of the federal and state governments 

health and personal information practices 

services and products provided by some of our businesses including some provided by our nuclear and pharmacy services and specialty solutions divisions involve access to patientidentifiable healthcare information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act as well as some state laws regulate the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information including requiring specified privacy and security measures federal and state officials have increasingly focused on how patientidentifiable healthcare information should be handled secured and disclosed 

some of our businesses collect and maintain other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 

environmental health and safety laws 

in the united states and other countries we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws as well as laws relating to safe working conditions laboratory and manufacturing practices 

laws relating to foreign trade and operations 

united states and international laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 

similarly we are subject to laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and foreign antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 

other information 

although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with united states government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in item 1business above we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as effective sourcing and enhanced cost control measures our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate further consolidation among our customers and suppliers including branded pharmaceutical manufacturers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may adversely impact our results of operations 

we have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue 

our sales and credit concentration is significant cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 22 percent and 21 percent respectively of our fiscal 2012 revenue the aggregate of our five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 59 percent of our fiscal 2012 revenue in addition walgreens and cvs accounted for 25 percent and 19 percent 

respectively of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2012 our contracts with cvs and walgreens are scheduled to expire in june 2013 and august 2013 respectively if cvs walgreens or one of our other large customers terminates or does not renew its contract defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases of our products our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected for example in july 2012 express scripts inc informed us that it had not awarded us the combined pharmaceutical distribution contract following its merger with medco health solutions inc our contract with express scripts inc expires on september 30 2012 and provided approximately 90 billion of revenue in fiscal 2012 all of which was classified as bulk sales the expiration of that contract will have an adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flow 

our pharmaceutical segments margin may be affected by fewer or less profitable generic pharmaceutical launches prices established by manufacturers and other factors that are beyond our control 

as described in greater detail in item 1business above margin in our pharmaceutical segment consists in part of generic manufacturer margin and margin from branded pharmaceutical price appreciation 

the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches varies from year to year and the margin impact of new launches varies from product to product fewer generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those previously experienced will have an adverse effect on our yearoveryear margins additionally prices for existing generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time although this may vary price deflation on existing generic pharmaceuticals will have an adverse effect on our margins 

with respect to branded pharmaceutical price appreciation if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by amounts smaller than have been experienced historically we will earn less margin on branded pharmaceuticals 

the united states healthcare environment is changing in many ways some of which may not be favorable to us including changes resulting from federal healthcare legislation 

the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and contain costs medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined the use of managed care has increased distributors manufacturers healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and large purchasing groups are prevalent 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “healthcare reform acts” were enacted among other things the healthcare reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to over 30 million uninsured americans many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until 2014 including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the healthcare reform acts could affect us adversely 

 

the healthcare reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions including as discussed in item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below a tax to be paid by medical device manufacturers 

in addition the healthcare reform acts have provisions designed to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including changing the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than 175 percent of the average weighted manufacturers price amp from 250 percent of the lowest amp for generic pharmaceuticals the centers for medicare and medicaid services is also considering providing states with alternatives to traditional reimbursement metrics 

we could be adversely affected directly or indirectly if our customers are adversely affected by these and other changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical devices or healthcare services 

our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated as described in greater detail in item 1business above we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries in addition the united states federal and state governments are devoting greater resources to the enforcement of these laws if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to hold permits licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of governmental bodies failure to maintain or renew necessary permits licenses or approvals or to comply with required standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters relating to our distribution of controlled substances 

products that we manufacture source distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product recalls or seizures or criminal and civil sanctions 

we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse if we fail to comply with them we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or false claims act proceedings initiated by private parties which could result in civil and criminal sanctions including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the requirements of these laws are complicated and subject to interpretation and may be applied by a regulator prosecutor or judge in a manner that could negatively impact us or require us to change our operations 

our global operations are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and with united states and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with them we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions 

we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed such as the repeal of lastin firstout lifo treatment of inventory or the current us taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition 

carefusion may not satisfy its contractual obligations 

in august 2009 we entered into a tax matters agreement pursuant to which carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spinoff the indemnification receivable was 265 million at june 30 2012 the failure of carefusion to perform its obligations under this agreement could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the spinoff may have unexpected tax consequences 

in connection with the spinoff we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” in addition we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel similarly the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for united states federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to united states federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities 

 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 

we rely on information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities or our customers access to them are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events cyber security incidents or other actions of third parties or fail for any extended period of time any data security breach could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements including those related to patientidentifiable health information 

as further described below in item 9acontrols and procedures the medical segment has implemented a medical business transformation project which includes a new information system for certain supply chain and financial processes if the system fails to operate as intended it could adversely affect medical segment profit and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

because of the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings for instance some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations 

acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition or we may encounter unforeseen accounting internal control regulatory or compliance issues 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural disasters or could be terminated a sustained supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years so costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations are subject to economic political and currency risks 

our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition political changes also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location we may not be able to hedge or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks and any hedges or insurance may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 

economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services  

deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and therefore reduce purchases of our products and services by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations

performance graphs 

in the past we have presented line graphs comparing the cumulative total return of our common shares with the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s composite—500 stock index the sp 500 index and the value line healthcare sector index the value line healthcare sector index an independently prepared index that includes more than 100 companies in the healthcare industry this year we have also included a comparison against the standard  poors composite—500 healthcare index the sp 500 healthcare index an independently prepared index that includes more than 50 companies in the healthcare industry next year we do not intend to include the value line healthcare index in our comparison of cumulative total return we are changing to the sp 500 healthcare index because we believe it to be a more commonly used index by large healthcare companies 

five year performance graph 

the following graph assumes in each case an initial investment of 100 on june 30 2007 based on the market prices at the end of each fiscal year through and including june 30 2012  and reinvestment of dividends the value line healthcare sector index the sp 500 healthcare index and the sp 500 index investments are weighted on the basis of market capitalization at the beginning of each period we have adjusted the market price of our common shares prior to august 31 2009 to reflect the spinoff of carefusion on august 31 2009 

 



post spinoff graph 

we have included a second graph below to show our cumulative total return compared with the cumulative total return of the sp 500 index the value line healthcare sector index and the sp 500 healthcare index since the spinoff of our clinical and medical products business on august 31 2009 the line graph assumes in each case an initial investment of 100 on august 31 2009 through and including june 30 2012  and reinvestment of dividends we have adjusted the market price of our common shares on august 31 2009 to reflect the spinoff 

 






 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are referring to our continuing operations 

overview 

we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies hospitals surgery centers physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs enhancing efficiency and improving quality we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 

during fiscal 2012 we achieved revenue of 1076 billion and increased our operating earnings by 18 percent to 18 billion our growth in revenue was due to increased volume from existing customers 24 billion and acquisitions 24 billion the increase in operating earnings reflects strong performance in our pharmaceutical segment generic programs the positive impact of acquisitions and a 71 million gain realized upon adjusting the contingent consideration obligation associated with the p4 healthcare acquisition earnings from continuing operations were up 11 percent for the twelve months ended june 30 2012 due to the factors discussed above 

our cash and equivalents balance was 23 billion  as of june 30 2012  compared to 19 billion  as of june 30 2011  the increase in cash and equivalents was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities of 12 billion  partially offset by share repurchases of 450 million  and cash dividends of 300 million  we plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value 

trends 

within our pharmaceutical segment we expect revenue to decrease in fiscal 2013 the factors contributing to this decrease include reduced revenue as a result of brandedtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions and the expiration on september 30 2012 of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts inc brandedtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenues because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding branded product and because some of our customers source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than purchasing from us our contract with express scripts inc was not renewed in connection with the combined pharmaceutical distribution contract that was not awarded to us following that companys merger with medco health solutions inc we recognized approximately 90 billion of revenue from sales to express scripts inc in fiscal 2012 all of which was classified as bulk sales 

 

in our pharmaceutical segment we also anticipate fewer significant new generic pharmaceutical product launches in fiscal 2013 however the impact of these launches on our gross margin can vary depending on the timing size and number of entrants 

within our medical segment variability in the cost of commodities such as oilbased resins cotton latex diesel fuel and other commodities can have a significant impact on the cost of products sold although commodity prices fluctuate we do not expect changes in commodity prices to have a significant impact on our yearoveryear results of operations in fiscal 2013 

the healthcare reform acts include a tax to be paid by medical device manufacturers equal to 23 percent of the price for which manufacturers sell their products which is scheduled to begin january 1 2013 we manufacture and sell devices that based on the currently proposed rules will be subject to this tax there have been proposals to repeal this tax and modify the proposed rules which if adopted may reduce the impact of this tax on us 

acquisitions 

we have completed several acquisitions since july 1 2009 the largest of which were kinray p4 healthcare and cardinal health china each of which was completed in fiscal 2011 in this managements discussion and analysis we identify the contribution of an acquisition until the oneyear anniversary of the acquisition using this definition for fiscal 2012 and 2011 acquisitions contributed revenues of 24 billion and 29 billion respectively and operating earnings of 79 million and 61 million respectively 

see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for more information on acquisitions 

spinoff of carefusion 

effective august 31 2009 we separated our clinical and medical products business through the distribution to our shareholders of 81 percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion and retained the remaining 41 million shares of carefusion common stock during fiscal 2011  and 2010  we disposed of 30 million  and 11 million  shares of carefusion common stock respectively 

we entered into a separation agreement with carefusion on july 22 2009 to effect the spinoff and provide a framework for our relationship with carefusion after the spinoff in addition on august 31 2009 we entered into a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement and an accounts receivable factoring agreement with carefusion among other agreements 

under the transition services agreement during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  we recognized 3 million  65 million  and 99 million  respectively in transition service fee income 

under the tax matters agreement carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spinoff the indemnification receivable was 265 million  and 264 million  at june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively and is included in other longterm assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

under the accounts receivable factoring agreement during fiscal 2011  and 2010 we purchased 460 million  and 606 million of carefusion trade receivables respectively the accounts receivable factoring arrangement expired on april 1 2011 

results of operations 

revenue   



fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

pharmaceutical segment 

revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2012 by acquisitions 23 billion and increased sales to existing customers 20 billion 

revenue from bulk sales was 402 billion and 419 billion for fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively during fiscal 2012 revenue from bulk sales decreased 4 percent as a result of the conversion of branded pharmaceuticals to generic pharmaceuticals as well as a shift in sales mix for certain retail chain pharmacy customers to nonbulk from bulk revenue from nonbulk sales was 577 billion and 518 billion for fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively revenue from nonbulk sales increased 11 percent during fiscal 2012 primarily due to acquisitions and the previously mentioned shift in sales see “item 1business” for more information about bulk and nonbulk sales 

medical segment 

revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2012 by increased volume from existing customers 335 million including the positive impact from sales of selfmanufactured and private brand products and the transition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of our relationship with carefusion from a feeforservice arrangement to a traditional distribution model 131 million this transition had minimal impact on medical segment profit 

fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010   

pharmaceutical segment 

during fiscal 2011 pharmaceutical revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions net of divestitures 27 billion and increased sales to existing customers 18 billion revenue was negatively impacted by losses of customers in excess of gains 584 million 

 

medical segment 

medical revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2011 by increased volume from existing customers 354 million these revenue gains were partially offset by the impact of lost customers in excess of gains 165 million and decreased volume as a result of strong demand for flurelated products in the prior year 51 million 

cost of products sold 

consistent with the increases in revenue our cost of products sold increased 45 billion or 5 percent during fiscal 2012 and increased by 38 billion or 4 percent during fiscal 2011 see the following gross margin discussion for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold 

gross margin 



fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

pharmaceutical segment 

gross margin increased 335 million in fiscal 2012 

strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs including the impact of new product launches increased gross margin by 287 million 

acquisitions positively impacted gross margin by 122 million 

increased margin under branded and generic manufacturer agreements exclusive of related volume impact had a positive impact on gross margin of 49 million due in part to price appreciation on a few specific generic pharmaceutical products 

pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes including rebates exclusive of the related volume impact adversely impacted gross margin by an estimated 179 million the adverse impact of these customer pricing changes was partially offset by product mix sourcing programs and other sources of margin 

medical segment 

gross margin increased 47 million in fiscal 2012 

favorable product sales mix and increased sales volume resulted in a 100 million favorable impact to gross margin 

increased cost of oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities used in our selfmanufactured products decreased gross margin by 66 million 

fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010   

pharmaceutical segment 

gross margin increased 446 million in fiscal 2011 

strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs including the impact of new product launches increased gross margin by 239 million 

acquisitions net of divestitures positively impacted gross margin by 198 million 

increased margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements exclusive of the related volume impact had a positive impact on gross margin of 72 million the increase was primarily due to our performance under distribution service agreements and the transition of certain vendors to distribution service agreements 

pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes including rebates exclusive of the related volume impact adversely impacted gross margin by an estimated 99 million the adverse impact of these customer pricing changes was partially offset by product mix sourcing programs and other sources of margin 

medical segment 

gross margin decreased 59 million in fiscal 2011 

increased cost of oilbased resins cotton latex diesel fuel and other commodities used in our selfmanufactured products decreased gross margin by 59 million 

increased net sales volume resulted in a 22 million favorable impact to gross margin 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we realized a onetime gain of 14 million as a result of the recognition of previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion 

somewhat sluggish healthcare utilization disproportionately affected surgical procedures and consequently our highermargin products 

distribution selling general and administrative expenses 



increased sga in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to acquisitions 65 million and business system investments including the medical segment business transformation project the increase in sga in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to acquisitions net of divestitures 90 million 

sga also included costs related to the spinoff of 2 million 10 million and 11 million for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

segment profit and consolidated operating earnings 



segment profit 

we evaluate the performance of the individual segments based upon among other things segment profit which is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold less segment sga expenses we do not allocate restructuring and employee severance acquisitionrelated costs impairments and gainloss on sale of assets litigation recoveriescharges net certain investment and other spending to our segments these costs are retained at corporate investment spending generally includes the first year spend for certain projects which require incremental strategic investments in the form of additional operating expenses we encourage our segments to identify investment projects which will promote innovation and provide future returns as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management the expenses for such projects are often retained at corporate in addition spinoff costs included within sga are not allocated to our segments see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 

pharmaceutical segment profit 

the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs including the impact of new product launches the positive impact of acquisitions and increased margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes see the discussion of gross margin above for further information on these drivers 

segment profit from bulk sales increased 19 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 and was 10 percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years segment profit from nonbulk sales increased 210 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 and was 90 percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years the generic pharmaceutical programs and acquisitions discussed above primarily impacted segment profit from nonbulk sales 

medical segment profit 

the principal drivers for the decrease in fiscal 2012 were the increased cost of commodities used in our selfmanufactured products and an increase in sga expenditures including the impact of business system investments these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product sales mix and increased net sales volume see the discussion above for further information on these drivers 

results for fiscal 2011 were adversely affected by increased cost of commodities used in our selfmanufactured products partially offset by increased sales volume results also were impacted by the negative yearoveryear impact of recognizing in fiscal 2010 a onetime gain related to previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion 

consolidated operating earnings 

in addition to revenue gross margin and sga discussed above operating earnings were impacted by the following 



restructuring and employee severance 

fiscal 2011 and 2010 restructuring and employee severance charges included 7 million and 65 million respectively of costs arising from the spinoff 

acquisitionrelated costs 

acquisitionrelated costs for fiscal 2012 included income realized upon adjusting the contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with the p4 healthcare acquisition the former owners of p4 healthcare had the right to receive certain contingent payments based on targeted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as a result of changes in our estimate of performance in future periods due in large part to the loss of revenue from a significant customer of the p4 healthcare legacy business in fiscal 2012 we revised the timing and amount of ebitda estimates and made changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the ebitda targets these changes coupled with the progress of discussions with the former owners regarding an early termination and settlement of the contingent consideration obligation resulted in a 71 million decrease in the fair value of the obligation to 4 million at june 30 2012 in early july 2012 we reached final settlement and payment of the remaining contingent consideration liability for 4 million  see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on this item 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 78 million 67 million and 10 million for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

impairments and loss on disposal of assets 

during fiscal 2012 we recorded a charge of 16 million to write off an indefinite life intangible asset related to the p4 healthcare trade name we have rebranded p4 healthcare under the cardinal health specialty solutions name 

during fiscal 2010 we recognized an impairment charge of 18 million related to the writedown of specialtyscripts llc specialty scripts a business within our pharmaceutical segment we sold specialtyscripts during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

during fiscal 2010 we recognized income of 41 million resulting from settlement of a class action antitrust claim in which we were a class member in addition we recognized 26 million of income for insurance proceeds released from escrow after litigation commenced against certain directors and officers in 2004 was resolved 

earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations 

in addition to items discussed above earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following 



interest expense net 

the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to favorable interest rate swaps 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during fiscal 2010 we recognized a 40 million loss from the early retirement of over 11 billion of debt securities through a tender offer 

gain on sale of investment in carefusion common stock 

we recognized 75 million and 45 million of income during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively related to the sale of our investment in carefusion common stock 

provision for income taxes 

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and united states state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  see note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation 



fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

the fiscal 2012 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a settlement of the fiscal 2001 and 2002 irs audits 40 million or 24 percentage points the yearoveryear comparison of the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the release in fiscal 2011 of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance 

fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010   

the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by 28 million or 19 percentage points attributable to recognizing no income tax expense on the sale of carefusion stock due to the release of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance an unfavorable charge of 168 million or 139 percentage points attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore in fiscal 2010 favorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison of the effective tax rate 

ongoing audits 

during fiscal 2012 the irs closed audits of fiscal 2001 and 2002 and is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2003 through 2010 we have received proposed adjustments from the irs for fiscal 2003 through 2007 related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us the irs has proposed additional taxes of 849 million excluding penalties and interest if this tax ultimately must be paid carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement for 592 million of the total amount we disagree with these proposed adjustments which we are contesting and have accounted for the unrecognized tax benefits related to them 

earningsloss from discontinued operations 

carefusion operating results are included within earnings from discontinued operations for all periods through the date of the spinoff and had a significant impact on earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal 2010 see note 5 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on discontinued operations 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based upon available capital resources cash on hand projected operating cash flow and access to committed credit facilities we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures business growth and expansion contractual obligations payments for tax settlements and current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases during fiscal 2012 we completed several small acquisitions with cash on hand if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need supplemental funding 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 23 billion  at june 30 2012  compared to 19 billion  at june 30 2011  at june 30 2012  our cash and cash equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities of 12 billion  and net proceeds of 290 million from the sale and repayment of notes during fiscal 2012  we deployed 450 million of cash on share repurchases 300 million on dividends 263 million on capital expenditures and 174 million on acquisitions 

during fiscal 2011 we deployed 23 billion of cash on acquisitions 291 million on capital expenditures 274 million on dividends and 270 million on share repurchases during fiscal 2011 we received 706 million in proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in carefusion common stock 

during fiscal 2010 we deployed 350 million of cash to repay floating rate notes at maturity 260 million on capital expenditures 253 million on dividends and 230 million on share repurchases during fiscal 2010 we completed a 11 billion debt tender using a portion of the 14 billion of cash distributed to us from carefusion in connection with the spinoff we also received 271 million in proceeds from the sale of our investment in carefusion common stock and 154 million from divestitures 

we use days sales outstanding “dso” days inventory on hand “dioh” and days payable outstanding “dpo” to evaluate our working capital performance dso is calculated as trade receivables net divided by average daily revenue during the last month of the reporting period dioh is calculated as inventories divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period chargeback billings are the difference between a product’s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price established between the vendors and the end customer 



changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors in the regular course of business 

dso increased in fiscal 2012 as a result of the medical segments business transformation project implementation which led to an increase in trade receivables at june 30 2012 dioh increased in fiscal 2012 as a result of inventory increases related to onboarding a new pharmaceutical customer and the medical segments business transformation project implementation 

the increase in dso in fiscal 2011 was driven by the impact of acquisitions and the increase in dpo was due to the timing of payments to vendors in the regular course of business 

the cash and equivalents balance at the end of fiscal 2012  included 380 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations as a us parent company we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 

in fiscal 2013 we expect two matters to adversely affect our operating cash flows by approximately 500 million compared to fiscal 2012 specifically we anticipate that we will make cash payments to the irs as we work to reach resolution on audits of fiscal 2003 through 2005 however we can provide no assurance regarding the likelihood or timing of reaching resolution   we also expect a negative working capital impact from the expiration of our contract with express scripts inc 

 

ownership of carefusion common stock 

during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we disposed of 30 million and 11 million shares of carefusion common stock for cash proceeds of 706 million and 271 million respectively we have no remaining ownership in carefusion 

credit facilities and commercial paper 

our sources of liquidity include a 15 billion  revolving credit facility and a 950 million  committed receivables sales facility program at times availability under our committed receivables sales facility program may be less than 950 million based on receivables concentration limits and our outstanding eligible receivables balance our revolving credit facility expires in may 2016  and our committed receivables sales facility program expires in november 2012  we also have a commercial paper program of up to 15 billion  backed by the revolving credit facility 

we had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june 30 2012 and 2011 we also had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at june 30 2012  and 2011  except for 44 million  of standby letters of credit in each fiscal year our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facility programs require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of any fiscal quarter end of at least 4to1  and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1  as of june 30 2012  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

heldtomaturity investments 

we held high quality investment grade heldtomaturity fixed income debt securities with an amortized cost basis of 72 million  and 142 million  as of june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively these investments vary in maturity date ranging from one to six months and pay interest semiannually 

longterm obligations 

as of june 30 2012  we had total longterm obligations of 29 billion  compared to 25 billion  at june 30 2011  in may 2012  we sold 250 million  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2017  with interest at 1900 per year “ 1900  notes” in a registered offering the 1900  notes mature on june 15 2017  in may 2012  we also sold 250 million  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2022  with interest at 3200 per year “ 3200  notes” in a registered offering the 3200  notes mature on june 15 2022  these notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness we used the proceeds to repay 206 million  of our 565  notes due june 15 2012  the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of other indebtedness including 300 million  aggregate principal of our 550  notes due june 15 2013  

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  were 263 million  291 million  and 260 million  respectively primarily related to information technology projects 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 to be less than in fiscal 2012 we anticipate that we will be able to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities fiscal 2013 capital expenditures will be largely focused on information technology projects 

dividends 

during fiscal 2012  we paid quarterly dividends of 0215  per share or 086  per share on an annualized basis an increase of 10 percent from fiscal 2011 on may 2 2012 our board of directors approved a 10 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to 02375 per share or 095 per share on an annualized basis payable on july 15 2012 to shareholders of record on july 1 2012

interest rate and currency risk management 

we use foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt see item 7a below as well as notes 1 and 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

 

contractual obligations 

as of june 30 2012  our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 



  

 recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations for continuing operations and ii require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us through our distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 126 million and 134 million at june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 90 days to 10 years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 16 million and 15 million at june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

our methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 

the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 



 

a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables salestype leases and finance notes receivables at june 30 2012  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 6 million 

we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2012  are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

inventories 

a substantial portion of inventories  69  percent and 70  percent at june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively are stated at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time so our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time so our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 

the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the fifo “first in first out” method or market if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2012  or 2011  primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline inventories at lifo were 72 million  and 8 million  higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2012  and 2011  

inventories recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 37 million  and 40 million  at june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively we determine reserves for inventory obsolescence based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for trade names customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of acquisition the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangibles 

purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful lives 

goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount if estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any which would be recorded as an expense to our results of operations application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 

we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear and pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear and pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division and medical operating segment 

fair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and market 

 

based approaches under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return to further confirm the fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our fiscal 2012 testing we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment as permitted by the amended accounting guidance adopted during the year see note 6 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

if we alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2012  2011  or 2010  

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our estimate methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

vendor reserves were 55 million  and 41 million  at june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively approximately 72 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2012  pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 65 percent at the end of fiscal 2011  the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period to period timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the following table presents information about our tax position 



 expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 

 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a detailed disclosure of the unrecognized tax benefits 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 percent on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease by 17 million for fiscal 2012  

sharebased compensation 

all sharebased payments to employees including grants of options are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

we analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years  as required the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange interest rate and commodity price related changes we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk see notes 1 and 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

by nature of our global operations our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature principal drivers of this foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro japanese yen malaysian ringgit mexican peso and thai baht 

transactional exposure 

our businesses’ transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries as part of our risk management program at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year the fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011  analyses utilized a currency portfolio model encompassing both implied volatility and historical correlation to estimate the net potential gain or loss these analyses included the estimated impact of our hedging program which mitigates our transactional exposure at each of june 30 2012  and 2011  we had hedged approximately 45 percent of our businesses’ transactional exposures the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to our transactional exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease 



translational exposure 

we have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency we perform a similar analysis as described above related to this translational exposure we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june 30 2012  and 2011  the following table summarizes our translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening or weakening in the us dollar 



 

interest rate sensitivity 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 

as part of our risk management program we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates at june 30 2012  and 2011  the potential increase or decrease in net annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 2 million and 1 million respectively 

commodity price sensitivity 

we are exposed to market price changes for commodities including oilbased resins cotton latex and diesel fuel we typically purchase raw materials at market prices and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year our forecasted commodity exposure as of june 30 2012  decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of commodity prices and changes in purchasing volumes 

at june 30 2012  and 2011  we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in commodity prices as of june 30 2012  and 2011  



we have additional exposure to commodities through the purchase of finished goods and various other energyrelated commodities including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business where our contracts are not directly tied to a commodity index we believe our total gross range of exposure to commodities including the items listed in the table above is 500 million to 600 million as of june 30 2012

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we evaluated with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of june 30 2012 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2012  to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also controls deemed effective now may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions or because compliance with the policies or procedures has deteriorated or been circumvented 

 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2012  in making this assessment management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso criteria” based on management’s assessment and the coso criteria management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2012  

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report appears following item 9a and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during fiscal 2012 the medical segment began implementing a business transformation project which includes a new information system for certain supply chain and financial processes the medical segment plans to continue to transition selected processes to the new system in fiscal 2013 we have made and will continue to make changes to our internal control over financial reporting in connection with this project during the quarter ended june 30 2012 we established additional temporary compensating controls that are expected to support our internal control over financial reporting while the implementation and operation of the new information system is finalized except for those made in connection with the new information system there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30 2012 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of cardinal health inc 

we have audited cardinal health inc and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2012  based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria cardinal health inc   and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “managements report on internal control over financial reporting” our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion cardinal health inc   and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2012  based on   the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of cardinal health inc and subsidiaries   as of june 30 2012  and 2011  and the related consolidated statements of earnings shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30 2012  of cardinal health inc and subsidiaries and our report dated august 22 2012  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

our fiscal year ends on june 30 references to fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 are to the fiscal years ended june 30 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively except as otherwise specified information in this form 10k is provided as of june 30 2011 

business segments 

the following business discussion is based on our two segments as they were structured for fiscal 2011 

pharmaceutical segment 

in the united states the pharmaceutical segment 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in china the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded generic and specialty pharmaceuticals as well as medical surgical overthecounter and consumer products through our yong yu subsidiary yong yu is one of the largest importers of pharmaceuticals into china and reaches a wide range of customers including more than 49000 hospitals and clinics and more than 123000 retail outlets 

the pharmaceutical distribution business generates gross margin primarily when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold net of manufacturer cash discount branded manufacturer margin and generic manufacturer margin 

manufacturer cash discounts are price reductions that manufacturers may offer to us for prompt payment of purchased products 

  

branded manufacturer margin refers to compensation amounts under distribution service agreements with manufacturers and to pharmaceutical price appreciation amounts earned under the distribution service agreements compensate us for a range of distribution and related services we provide to manufacturers and consist of a fee based on volume with or without pharmaceutical price appreciation in addition a manufacturer may increase its published price for a product after we have purchased that product for inventory our contract price for branded pharmaceutical products to customers is based on the manufacturer’s published price at the time of sale as such inventory sold following a manufacturer price increase will be based on the higher manufacturer price 

pharmaceutical price appreciation refers to amounts we earn from selling inventory at these increased prices 

generic manufacturer margin also referred to as “generic margin” refers to price discounts rebates and other incentives we receive from manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices tend to decline over time although this may vary 

bulk and nonbulk sales  the pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk sales based on the nature of our customers’ operations bulk sales consist of sales to retail chain customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses all other sales including all sales to customers located in china are classified as nonbulk sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer are classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and nonbulk sales with respect to its retail stores we formerly referred to bulk sales as bulk customers and nonbulk sales as nonbulk customers other than this change in terminology we have not changed how we categorize revenue segment expenses and segment profit with respect to our bulk and nonbulk sales 

substantially all bulk sales consist of products shipped in the same form that we receive them from the manufacturer a small portion of bulk sales are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping in contrast nonbulk sales require more complex servicing for nonbulk sales we may receive inventory in large or full case quantities and break it down into smaller quantities warehouse the product for a longer period of time pick individual products specific to a customer’s order and deliver that smaller order to a customer location 

bulk sales generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales customers receive lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than nonbulk sales due to volume pricing in a competitive market and due to lower costs related to the fewer services we provide in addition bulk sales in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales because bulk orders consist largely of higher cost branded products the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk sales is also driven by lower branded manufacturer margin and manufacturer cash discounts due to the mix of branded products in bulk sales segment distribution selling general and administrative “sga” expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales are substantially lower than from nonbulk sales because bulk sales require substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than nonbulk sales 

  

the following table shows the revenues segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk sales for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

 see note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for pharmaceutical segment revenue profit and assets for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 

medical segment 

the medical segment distributes a broad range of medical surgical and laboratory products to hospitals surgery centers laboratories physician offices and other healthcare providers in the united states and canada this segment also manufactures sources and develops its own line of private brand medical and surgical products manufactured products include singleuse surgical drapes gowns and apparel exam and surgical gloves and fluid suction and collection systems the segment also offers sterile and nonsterile procedure kits our manufactured products are sold directly or through thirdparty distributors in the united states canada europe south america and the asiapacific region in addition the segment provides supply chain services including spend management distribution management and inventory management services to healthcare providers 

see note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for medical segment revenue profit and assets for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

in the past five fiscal years we completed the following three significant acquisitions apart from businesses spunoff as part of carefusion corporation “carefusion” as discussed below 

 

  

   we also completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years including purchasing borschow hospital  medical supplies inc in fiscal 2009 

during the past five fiscal years we also completed several divestitures including selling our former pharmaceutical technologies and services segment other than certain genericfocused businesses for approximately 32 billion in cash during fiscal 2007 and selling our united kingdombased martindale injectable manufacturing business in fiscal 2010 in addition effective august 31 2009 we separated our clinical and medical products businesses through distribution to our shareholders of 81 percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion the “spinoff” during fiscal 2010 we disposed of 109 million shares of carefusion common stock and during fiscal 2011 we disposed of the remaining 305 million shares viasys healthcare inc and enturia inc two significant acquisitions in the last five years were spunoff as part of carefusion 

customers 

our largest customers walgreen co “walgreens” and cvs caremark corporation “cvs” accounted for approximately 23 percent and 22 percent respectively of our revenue for fiscal 2011 the aggregate of our five largest customers including walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately 59 percent of our revenue for fiscal 2011 

we have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp arrangements with these two gpos accounted for approximately 14 percent of our revenue for fiscal 2011 

suppliers 

we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 22 percent of our revenue during fiscal 2011 but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 5 percent of that revenue overall we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good 

  

the pharmaceutical distribution business is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these agreements generally have terms ranging from one year with an automatic renewal feature to five years generally these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree if there is an uncured breach of the agreement or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 

our pharmaceutical segment’s nuclear pharmacy services business dispenses several products prepared using a particular radioisotope during fiscal 2010 it was difficult to acquire sufficient quantities of that radioisotope from thirdparty suppliers because of a continued and prolonged shortage of a critical raw material used to derive that radioisotope however the supply of raw material normalized in the first half of fiscal 2011 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products we compete on many levels including service offerings support services breadth of product lines and price 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with two other national fullline wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains direct selling manufacturers specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers 

in the medical segment we compete with many different distributors including owens  minor inc thermo fisher scientific inc pss world medical inc henry schein inc and medline industries inc in addition we compete with regional medical products distributors thirdparty logistics companies and manufacturers’ direct distribution competitors of the medical segment’s manufacturing and procedural kit businesses include kimberlyclark corporation ansell limited deroyal industries inc medline industries inc mölnlycke health care america contract sterilization professional hospital supply and medical action industries 

employees 

as of june 30 2011 we had approximately 22600 employees in the united states and approximately 9300 employees outside of the united states overall we consider our employee relations to be good 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we hold patents relating to aspects of our distribution operations including our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings and relating to medical and surgical products such as fluid suction and irrigation devices surgical waste management systems surgical and medical examination gloves surgical drapes gowns and facial protection products and patient temperature management products we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations but we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

  

regulatory matters 

our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon their specific business our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal they can require us to suspend distribution of products and controlled substances or initiate product recalls they can seize products or impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions and they can seek injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products 

distribution  the fda dea and various state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products and controlled substances under various state and federal statutes including the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal controlled substances act governing the sale marketing packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 above we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as enhanced cost control measures our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate further consolidation among our customers and suppliers including branded pharmaceutical manufacturers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may adversely impact our results of operations 

  

we have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue 

as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 above our sales and credit concentration is significant for example walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately 23 percent and 22 percent respectively of our revenue for fiscal 2011 the aggregate of our five largest customers including walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately 59 percent of our revenue for fiscal 2011 in addition walgreens and cvs accounted for 31 percent and 20 percent respectively of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2011 if one or more of our large customers default in payment terminate or do not renew contracts or significantly reduce their purchases of our products our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 

the united states healthcare environment is changing in many ways some of which may not be favorable to us including changes resulting from federal healthcare legislation 

the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care improve safety and contain costs medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined the use of managed care has increased distributors manufacturers healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and large purchasing groups are more prevalent 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “healthcare reform acts” were enacted among other things the healthcare reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured americans many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until 2014 including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the healthcare reform acts could affect us adversely the healthcare reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid beginning in 2013 each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices we manufacture and sell devices that will be subject to this tax additionally the healthcare reform acts changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than 175 percent of the average weighted manufacturer’s price from 250 percent of the lowest average manufacturer’s price for generic pharmaceuticals we could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical devices or healthcare services 

our business requires consistent diligent and rigorous compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated as described above in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries in addition the united states federal government and state governments are devoting greater resources to the enforcement of these laws if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 

 

  

   

  

  

 we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of many jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed such as the repeal of lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory or the current us taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition 

our pharmaceutical segment’s margin may be affected by prices established by manufacturers or market forces that are beyond our control 

as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 we generate a portion of our branded manufacturer margin from pharmaceutical price appreciation if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by smaller amounts we will earn less branded manufacturer margin in addition prices for generic pharmaceuticals distributed by our pharmaceutical distribution business have generally declined over time which could have an adverse effect on our generic manufacturer margin if not offset by generic pharmaceutical programs including new product launches 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 

we rely on information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities are interrupted 

  

damaged by unforeseen events or actions of third parties or fail for any extended period of time any data security breach could adversely impact our operations results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements 

the medical segment is working on a medical business transformation project which includes a new information system for certain supply chain processes the medical segment is planning to transition selected processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2012 and 2013 if the system is not effectively implemented or fails to operate as intended it could adversely affect the medical segment’s supply chain operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

because of the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in legal proceedings for instance some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could harm our cash flows or results of operations 

acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be 

an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses as described above in fiscal 2011 we acquired kinray p4 healthcare and yong yu acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition we may encounter unforeseen accounting or internal control over financial reporting issues or the acquired business may have regulatory or compliance issues that we did not anticipate 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials and energy including radioisotopes and oilbased resins cotton latex diesel fuel and other commodities supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control including natural disasters or could be terminated a sustained interruption in the flow of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business in addition while we have processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations 

our manufacturing businesses use oilbased resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years so our costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations are subject to economic political and currency risks 

our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition political changes can disrupt our supply chain—as well as our customers and 

  

operating activities—in a particular location we may not be able to enter into hedges or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks and any hedges that we enter into or insurance that we are able to obtain may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 

risks associated with the spinoff 

carefusion may not satisfy all of its contractual obligations  we entered into a number of agreements with carefusion that govern the rights and obligations of the parties following the spinoff we have certain rights under those agreements including indemnification against certain liabilities allocated to carefusion the failure of carefusion to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the transaction may have unexpected tax consequences  in connection with the spinoff we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” in addition we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel similarly the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in stock ownership of either cardinal health or carefusion if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for united states federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to united states federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are referring to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies hospitals surgery centers physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs enhancing efficiency and improving quality we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 

during fiscal 2011 we achieved record revenue of 1026 billion and increased our operating earnings by 16 percent to 15 billion we also acted on important strategic priorities that will strengthen our longterm position we expanded our retail independent customer base significantly with the kinray acquisition created strong growth from our generic pharmaceutical programs significantly enhanced our specialty business with the p4 healthcare acquisition and launched a growth platform in china with our yong yu acquisition 

during fiscal 2011 our pharmaceutical segment profit increased by 26 percent primarily due to strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs including the impact of new product launches solid performance under our branded manufacturer agreements and the positive impact of acquisitions our medical segment profit decreased by 14 percent adversely affected by the increased cost of commodities used in our selfmanufactured and private brand products 

also during fiscal 2011 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0195 per share or 078 per share on an annualized basis an increase of 11 percent over fiscal 2010 in may 2011 the board of directors also approved a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend beginning in july 2011 

our cash and equivalents balance was 19 billion at june 30 2011 compared to 28 billion at june 30 2010 we used 23 billion for acquisitions and received 14 billion of net cash provided by operations and 706 million from the sale of our remaining investment in carefusion we plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value 

trends 

within our pharmaceutical segment we expect branded pharmaceutical price appreciation in fiscal 2012 to be similar to fiscal 2011 we also expect significant new generic pharmaceutical launches in fiscal 2012 however their impact on our gross margin can vary significantly depending on timing size and number of entrants and may be less in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 in addition we expect our recent acquisitions to have a positive yearoveryear impact on revenue and operating earnings finally we may have a negative impact from a lifo charge in fiscal 2012 

within our medical segment variability in the cost of commodities such as oilbased resins cotton latex diesel fuel and other commodities can have a significant impact on the cost of products sold in fiscal 2012 we anticipate a negative yearoveryear impact from higher commodity prices in addition given the current economic and healthcare environments we expect healthcare utilization including surgical procedures to remain somewhat sluggish in fiscal 2012 

  

acquisitions 

in december 2010 we acquired kinray for a cash payment of 13 billion this acquisition expanded the ability of our pharmaceutical distribution business to serve retail independent pharmacies in the northeastern united states 

in november 2010 we acquired yong yu a leading health care distribution business in china for 458 million including the assumption of 57 million in debt the pharmaceutical market in china is expected to grow significantly faster than the market in the united states over the next few years 

in july 2010 we completed the acquisition of p4 healthcare a specialty pharmaceutical services company for a cash payment of 506 million this acquisition contributes to the expansion of our presence in specialty pharmaceutical services and distribution the acquisition agreement also included a contingent consideration obligation of up to 150 million over the next three years since we completed the acquisition we have made a cash payment of 10 million for the first measurement period subsequent to june 30 2011 we amended the agreement with the former owners to extend the last measurement period by one year and to reduce the maximum contingent consideration payout to 100 million at june 30 2011 we estimate the remaining contingent consideration obligation to have a fair value of 75 million 

the three acquisitions are reported within our pharmaceutical segment for fiscal 2011 they increased revenues by 29 billion and operating earnings by 61 million compared to fiscal 2010 

see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on the kinray yong yu and p4 healthcare acquisitions 

spinoff of carefusion 

effective august 31 2009 we separated our clinical and medical products business through the distribution to our shareholders of 81 percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion and retained the remaining 414 million shares of carefusion common stock during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we disposed of 305 million and 109 million shares of carefusion common stock respectively 

on july 22 2009 we entered into a separation agreement with carefusion to effect the spinoff and provide a framework for our relationship with carefusion after the spinoff in addition on august 31 2009 we entered into a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement and an accounts receivable factoring agreement with carefusion among other agreements 

under the transition services agreement during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we recognized 65 million and 99 million respectively in transition service fees which approximately offsets the costs associated with providing the transition services substantially all of the transition service arrangements expired in fiscal 2011 and early fiscal 2012 we expect that transition service fees in fiscal 2012 will be substantially less than in fiscal 2011 and that the loss of fees in fiscal 2012 will be partially offset by cost reductions for periods subsequent to fiscal 2012 we have plans in place to largely offset the loss of fees with cost reductions 

under the accounts receivable factoring agreement during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we purchased 460 million and 606 million respectively of carefusion trade receivables the accounts receivable factoring arrangement expired on april 1 2011 

under the tax matters agreement carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spinoff the indemnification receivable was 264 million and 245 million at june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively and is included in our consolidated financial statements 

we expect the transition of our relationship with carefusion to a traditional distribution model during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to have a 50 to 60 million per quarter positive impact on medical segment revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2012 however we expect this change to have minimal impact on medical segment profit 

  

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

pharmaceutical segment 

during fiscal 2011 pharmaceutical revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions net of divestitures 27 billion and increased sales to existing customers 18 billion revenue was negatively impacted by losses of customers in excess of gains 584 million 

revenue from bulk sales was 419 billion and 440 billion for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively during fiscal 2011 revenue from bulk sales decreased 5 percent as a result of the conversion of branded pharmaceuticals to generic pharmaceuticals as well as a shift in sales to certain national chain customers to nonbulk from bulk revenue from nonbulk sales was 518 billion and 458 billion for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively revenue from nonbulk sales increased 13 percent during fiscal 2011 primarily due to acquisitions and the previously mentioned shift in sales all sales for kinray yong yu and p4 healthcare are nonbulk see “item 1—business” for more information about bulk and nonbulk sales 

medical segment 

medical revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2011 by increased volume from existing customers 354 million these revenue gains were partially offset by the impact of lost customers in excess of gains 165 million and decreased volume as a result of strong demand for flurelated products in the prior year 51 million 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

pharmaceutical segment 

pharmaceutical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2010 by pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers a combined impact of 34 billion partially offset by losses of customers in excess of gains 13 billion 

medical segment 

medical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal 2010 by increased volume from existing hospital laboratory and ambulatory care customers 462 million driven partially by strong demand for flurelated products also positively impacting revenue were new products 74 million and foreign exchange 55 million in addition in connection with the spinoff we recognized previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion of 51 million prior to the spinoff we deferred revenue for products sold to carefusion businesses until the products were sold to the end customers losses of existing customers in excess of gains from new customers reduced revenue by 200 million 

  

cost of products sold 

consistent with the increases in revenue our cost of products sold increased 38 billion or 4 percent during fiscal 2011 and increased by 25 billion or 3 percent during fiscal 2010 

gross margin 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

pharmaceutical segment 

gross margin increased 446 million in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

  

  

 medical segment 

gross margin decreased 59 million in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

  

  

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

pharmaceutical segment 

gross margin decreased 65 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 medical segment 

gross margin increased 95 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

  

 distribution selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

the increase in sga in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to acquisitions net of divestitures 147 million which included amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets of 67 million and 10 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively sga also included costs related to the spinoff of 10 million and 11 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

increased sga during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in our management incentive compensation in fiscal 2010 we had incentive compensation accruals that were 46 million above plan due to better than expected consolidated performance compared with incentive compensation accruals that were 36 million below plan in fiscal 2009 in addition we incurred increased spending on strategic projects 51 million sga expense growth was significantly mitigated by cost control measures instituted in fiscal 2009 and reduced bad debt expense 25 million sga also included 11 million and 5 million of costs related to the spinoff for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

segment profit and operating earnings 

 

 segment profit 

we evaluate the performance of the individual segments based upon among other things segment profit which is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold less segment sga expenses we do not allocate restructuring and employee severance acquisitionrelated costs impairments and gainloss on sale of assets litigation recoveriescharges net certain investment and other spending to our segments these costs are retained at corporate investment spending generally includes the first year spend for certain projects which require incremental strategic investments in the form of additional operating expenses we encourage our segments to identify investment projects which will promote innovation and provide future returns as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management the expenses for such projects are often retained at corporate in addition spinoff costs included within sga are not allocated to our segments 

pharmaceutical segment 

the principal drivers for fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs including the impact of new product launches the positive impact of acquisitions and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical sales offset by customer pricing changes see the gross margin section above for discussion of these items 

the principal drivers for the decrease during fiscal 2010 were pricing changes on renewed customer contracts fewer significant generic pharmaceutical launches than the prior year and the medicine shoppe franchise transformation the decline in segment profit was partially offset by contributions from our generic programs disciplined cost controls and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical sales 

segment profit from bulk sales increased 20 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and was 11 percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years segment profit from nonbulk sales increased 243 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and was 89 percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years the generic pharmaceutical items and acquisitions discussed above primarily impacted segment profit from nonbulk sales 

medical segment 

compared to the prior year results for fiscal 2011 were adversely affected by increased cost of commodities used in our selfmanufactured and private brand products partially offset by increased sales volume results also were impacted by the negative yearoveryear impact of recognizing in fiscal 2010 a onetime gain related to previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion 

the principal drivers for the increase during fiscal 2010 were growth in sales to certain existing customers and decreased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements results were also positively affected by the onetime gain related to previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion segment profit growth was partially dampened from increased spending on strategic projects 

  

consolidated operating earnings 

in addition to revenue gross margin and sga discussed above operating earnings were impacted by the following 

 

 restructuring and employee severance 

fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 restructuring and employee severance charges included 7 million 65 million and 74 million respectively of costs arising from the spinoff 

acquisitionrelated costs 

during fiscal 2011 net acquisitionrelated costs included 21 million related to the kinray yong yu and p4 healthcare acquisitions the costs were partially offset by 6 million of income as a result of a decrease in the contingent consideration liability relating to the p4 healthcare acquisition which reflects actual performance for the first measurement period and changes in our estimate of performance in future measurement periods see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on this change 

impairments and loss on sale of assets 

in fiscal 2010 we recognized an impairment charge of 18 million related to the writedown of specialtyscripts a business within our pharmaceutical segment we completed the sale of specialtyscripts during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 

litigation recoveriescharges net 

in fiscal 2010 we received income of 41 million resulting from settlement of a class action antitrust claim in which we were a class member in addition we received 26 million of income for insurance proceeds released from escrow after litigation commenced against certain directors and officers in 2004 was resolved 

earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations 

in addition to items discussed above earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following 

 

 interest expense net 

the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during fiscal 2010 we recognized a 40 million loss from the early retirement of over 11 billion of debt securities through a tender offer 

gain on sale of investment in carefusion common stock 

we recognized 75 million and 45 million of income during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively related to realized gains from the sale of shares of carefusion common stock 

provision for income taxes 

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and united states state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by 28 million or 19 percentage points attributable to recognizing no income tax expense on the sale of carefusion stock due to the release of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance an unfavorable charge attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore in fiscal 2010 favorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison of the effective tax rate see below 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a charge of 168 million or 139 percentage points attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore the fiscal 2010 effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by 18 percentage points due to changes in our business mix resulting from the spinoff which resulted in a higher percentage of our pretax income being generated in the united states than in lower tax rate international jurisdictions a favorable audit settlement with a state taxing authority in fiscal 2009 also unfavorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison of the effective tax rate 

ongoing audits 

the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2010 we have received proposed adjustments from the irs related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us the irs proposed additional taxes of 849 million excluding penalties and interest if this tax ultimately must be 

  

paid carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement for 592 million of the total amount we disagree with these proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them and we believe our accruals for these matters are adequate 

earningsloss from discontinued operations 

carefusion operating results are included within earnings from discontinued operations for all periods through the date of the spinoff and had a significant impact on earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal 2010 and 2009 see note 5 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on discontinued operations 

recent developments 

in late august 2011 the fda notified us that it was halting entry into the united states of all procedure kits that we assemble in mexico and import at el paso texas “imported kits” the fda indicated that we had not supplied adequate documentary support for certain components of the imported kits but has not indicated any concerns about patient safety we are working with the fda to address their concerns and in the interim are implementing steps to mitigate the impact to customers and our business including shifting assembly of kits to facilities in the united states sales of the imported kits were approximately 5 percent of medical segment revenue in fiscal 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based upon available capital resources cash on hand projected operating cash flow and access to committed credit facilities we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures business growth and expansion contractual obligations current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases during fiscal 2011 we acquired kinray yong yu and p4 healthcare with cash on hand if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need supplemental funding 

capital resources 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 19 billion at june 30 2011 compared to 28 billion at june 30 2010 at june 30 2011 our cash and cash equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks around the world or invested in high quality shortterm liquid investments the decrease was primarily driven by acquisitions offset by net cash provided by operating activities which is primarily driven by net earnings and working capital and the sale of our remaining investment in carefusion changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors during the regular course of business 

we use days sales outstanding “dso” days inventory on hand “dioh” and days payable outstanding “dpo” to evaluate our working capital performance dso is calculated as trade receivables net divided by average daily revenue during the last month of the reporting period dioh is calculated as inventories divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period chargeback billings are the difference between a product’s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price established between the vendors and the end customer 

 

   

the increase in dso in fiscal 2011 was driven by the impact of acquisitions and the increase in dpo was due to the timing of payments to vendors during the regular course of business 

the decrease in dso in fiscal 2010 was driven by focused efforts to manage customer accounts and reduce delinquency rates the significant improvement in dioh in fiscal 2010 was largely due to enhanced efficiency in our supply chain operations to reduce inventory requirements the change in dpo during fiscal 2010 was largely driven by a change in payable terms with a supplier in our pharmaceutical segment 

during fiscal 2011 we deployed 23 billion of cash on acquisitions 291 million on capital expenditures 274 million on dividends and 270 million on share repurchases during fiscal 2011 we received 706 million in proceeds from sale of carefusion common stock 

during fiscal 2010 we deployed 260 million of cash on capital expenditures 253 million on dividends and 230 million on share repurchases an additional 20 million repurchased during fiscal 2010 settled during the first quarter of 2011 during fiscal 2010 we received 271 million in proceeds from sale of carefusion common stock and 154 million from the divestitures of our martindale business in the united kingdom and specialtyscripts in addition we completed a debt tender resulting in the purchase of more than 11 billion debt securities using cash of 14 billion distributed to us from carefusion in connection with the spinoff additionally in october 2009 we repaid our 350 million floating rate notes at maturity 

the cash and equivalents balance at the end of fiscal 2011 included 266 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations as a us parent company we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 

the net cash provided by discontinued operations for fiscal 2010 of 14 billion primarily reflected permanent financing obtained by carefusion prior to the spinoff offset by 90 million cash funding provided by us to carefusion pursuant to the spinoff separation agreement net cash provided byused in discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 of 341 million primarily related to the earnings and changes in working capital for carefusion 

ownership of shares of carefusion common stock 

during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we disposed of 305 million and 109 million shares of carefusion common stock for cash proceeds of 706 million and 271 million respectively 

credit facilities and commercial paper 

our sources of liquidity include a 15 billion revolving credit facility and a 950 million committed receivables sales facility program during fiscal 2011 we replaced our prior revolving credit facility with a new 15 billion facility that expires in may 2016 and amended the committed receivables sales facility program to extend its term to november 2012 we also have a commercial paper program of up to 15 billion backed by the revolving credit facility we had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june 30 2011 our ability to access the commercial paper market is limited based on our current credit rating from moody’s investor services 

our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of any fiscal quarter end of at least 4to1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1 as of june 30 2011 we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

  

heldtomaturity investments 

we hold high quality investment grade heldtomaturity fixed income debt securities with an amortized cost basis of 142 million as of june 30 2011 these investments vary in maturity date ranging from three months to sixteen months and pay interest semiannually 

longterm obligations 

as of june 30 2011 we had total longterm obligations of 25 billion compared to 21 billion at june 30 2010 in december 2010 we sold 500 million of fixed rate notes due 2020 in a registered offering the 2020 notes mature on december 15 2020 and accrue interest at 4625 per year payable semiannually we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes and for the repayment of 220 million of our 675 notes due february 15 2011 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were 291 million 260 million and 421 million respectively primarily related to information technology projects and investments to improve the efficiency of our distribution facilities 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 to be generally in line with the level of spending in fiscal 2011 we anticipate that we will be able to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities fiscal 2012 capital expenditures will be largely focused on information technology projects 

dividends 

during fiscal 2011 we paid quarterly dividends of 0195 per share or 078 per share on an annualized basis an increase of 11 percent from fiscal 2010 on may 4 2011 our board of directors approved a 10 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to 0215 per share or 086 per share on an annualized basis payable on july 15 2011 to shareholders of record on july 1 2011 

on august 3 2011 our board of directors approved our 108th consecutive regular quarterly dividend 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 250 million of our common shares during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 250 million of our common shares of which 20 million cash settled in july 2010 subsequent to june 30 2011 and through august 12 2011 we repurchased approximately 300 million of our common shares we funded the repurchases with available cash we have 450 million remaining under our current board repurchase authorization through november 2013 

interest rate and currency risk management 

we use foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt see item 7a below as well as notes 1 and 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

  

contractual obligations 

as of june 30 2011 our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 

 

  

     our acquisition of p4 healthcare during fiscal 2011 involves the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligation as the timing and amount are uncertain see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion of the maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with this acquisition 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations for continuing operations and ii require use of 

  

complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because our estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables—amounts owed to us through our operating activities—are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 90 days to 10 years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 

the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 

 

 a hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables salestype leases and finance notes receivables at june 30 2011 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 6 million 

we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2011 are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

inventories 

a substantial portion of inventories 70 percent at june 30 2011 and 73 percent at june 30 2010 is stated at the lower of cost using the lifo “last in first out” method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

  

the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time so our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time so our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation in fiscal 2011 and 2010 we did not record any lifo reserve reductions 

the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the fifo “first in first out” method or market 

if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline inventories at lifo were 8 million and 38 million higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost 

inventories recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 40 million at june 30 2011 and 34 million at june 30 2010 we determine reserves for inventory obsolescence based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for trade names customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives see note 2 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding our acquisitions including the contingent consideration related to the p4 healthcare acquisition 

goodwill and other intangibles 

purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives—primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks—continue to be amortized over their useful lives impairment testing involves a comparison of estimated fair value to the respective carrying amount if estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment which would be recorded as an expense to our results of operations 

application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including but not limited to the identification of reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment in fiscal 2011 we identified four reporting 

  

units pharmaceutical segment excluding our nuclear and pharmacy services division and yong yu division medical segment nuclear and pharmacy services division and yong yu division fair values can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of incomebased and marketbased approaches under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return to further confirm the fair value we compare our aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value see note 6 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

if we alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2011 2010 or 2009 

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our estimate methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

vendor reserves were 41 million and 28 million at june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively approximately 65 percent of the vendor reserve at june 30 2011 pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 59 percent at the end of fiscal 2010 the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period to period timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies 

the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

  

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the following table presents information about our tax position 

 

  

 expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a detailed disclosure of the unrecognized tax benefits 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 percent on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease by 15 million for fiscal 2011 

sharebased compensation 

all sharebased payments to employees including grants of options are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides for better estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we calculated separate option valuations for two separate groups of employees during fiscal 2009 we calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees the groups were determined using similar historical exercise behaviors the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant 7 years as required the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange interest rate and commodity price related changes we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk see notes 1 and 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

by nature of our global operations our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature principal drivers of this foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar european euro mexican peso and thai baht 

transactional exposure 

our businesses’ transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries as part of our risk management program at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 analyses utilize a currency portfolio model encompassing both implied volatility and historical correlation to estimate the net potential gain or loss these analyses included the estimated impact of our hedging program which mitigates our businesses’ transactional exposure at each of june 30 2011 and 2010 we had hedged approximately 45 percent of our businesses’ transactional exposures the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to our businesses’ transactional exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease 

 

 translational exposure 

we have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency we perform a similar analysis as described above related to this translational exposure we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june 30 2011 and 2010 the following table summarizes our businesses’ translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening or weakening in the us dollar 

 

 interest rate sensitivity 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 

  

as part of our risk management program we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates at june 30 2011 and 2010 the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 04 million and 03 million respectively 

commodity price sensitivity 

we are exposed to market price changes for commodities including oilbased resins cotton latex and diesel fuel we typically purchase raw materials at market prices and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year our forecasted commodity exposure as of june 30 2011 increased from the prior year primarily as a result of contract adjustments with vendors volatility of commodity prices changes in purchasing volumes and changes in the mix of items we buy we have updated the prior year comparable commodity exposure to include all items meeting this criteria 

at june 30 2011 and 2010 we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in commodity prices as of june 30 2011 and 2010 

 

 we also have additional exposure to commodities through the purchase of finished goods and various other energyrelated commodities including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business where our contracts are not directly tied to a commodity index we believe our total gross range of exposure to commodities including the items listed in the table above is 500 million to 600 million as of june 30 2012

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also controls deemed effective now may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions or because compliance with the policies or procedures has deteriorated or been circumvented 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2011 in making this assessment management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso criteria” based on management’s assessment and the coso criteria management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2011 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report appears following item 9a and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

implementation of new software systems 

the medical segment is working on a medical business transformation project which includes a new information system for certain supply chain processes this project did not impact internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2011 the medical segment plans to transition selected processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2012 and 2013 and this transition is expected to affect internal control over financial reporting if this system is not effectively implemented or fails to operate as intended it could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the shareholders and the 

board of directors of cardinal health inc 

we have audited cardinal health inc and subsidiaries’ the “company” internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2011 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2011 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of june 30 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of earnings shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30 2011 and our report dated august 25 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

spinoff of carefusion corporation 

on august 31 2009 we separated the clinical and medical products businesses from our other businesses through a pro rata distribution to shareholders of 81 of the then outstanding common stock of a whollyowned subsidiary carefusion corporation “carefusion” we refer to this transaction as the “spinoff” carefusion’s product lines are in the areas of intravenous infusion medication and supply dispensing respiratory care infection prevention and surgical instruments we retained 19 of carefusion common stock which we are required to dispose of before august 31 2014 pursuant to the private letter ruling we received from the internal revenue service the “irs” in connection with the spinoff as of june 30 2010 we owned approximately 305 million carefusion shares as part of the spinoff cardinal health and carefusion entered into a separation agreement and various other agreements relating to the separation including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement intellectual property agreements and certain other commercial agreements 

business segments 

for fiscal 2009 we reported financial information in three segments healthcare supply chain services clinical and medical products and all other from july 1 2009 to august 31 2009 we reported financial information in three different segments pharmaceutical medical and carefusion the pharmaceutical segment included the businesses that were previously within the healthcare supply chain services segment that distributed pharmaceutical radiopharmaceutical and overthecounter healthcare products as well as the businesses previously within the all other segment the medical segment included the remaining businesses within the healthcare supply chain services segment and certain surgical and exam gloves surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses that were previously within the clinical and medical products segment the carefusion segment included the businesses previously within the clinical and medical products segment but not the abovereferenced surgical and exam gloves surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses all businesses in the carefusion segment were part of the spinoff 

once the spinoff was completed our remaining businesses were organized into our current two segments pharmaceutical and medical the following business discussion is based on the two segments as they were structured for fiscal 2010 

pharmaceutical segment 

the pharmaceutical segment 

 

  

   

  

 the pharmaceutical distribution business is a fullservice wholesale distributor to retail customers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers hospitals and alternate care providers including mail order pharmacies located throughout the united states and in puerto rico pharmaceutical distribution maintains prime vendor relationships that streamline the purchasing process resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs for our customers pharmaceutical distribution also helps pharmaceutical manufacturers with services including distribution inventory management datareporting new product launch support and contract and chargeback administration 

the pharmaceutical distribution business generates gross margin primarily when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold net of manufacturer cash discount branded manufacturer margin and generic manufacturer margin 

“ manufacturer cash discounts ” are price reductions that manufacturers may offer to us for prompt payment of purchased products 

“ branded manufacturer margin ” also referred to as “branded margin” refers to compensation amounts under distribution service agreements with manufacturers and to pharmaceutical price appreciation compensation under the distribution service agreements may be a fee based on volume with or without pharmaceutical price appreciation a manufacturer may increase its published price for a product after we have purchased that product for inventory our contract price for branded pharmaceutical products to customers is based on the manufacturer’s published price at the time of sale as such inventory sold following a manufacturer price increase will be based on the higher manufacturer price “ pharmaceutical price appreciation ” refers to amounts we earn from selling inventory at these increased prices 

“ generic manufacturer margin ” also referred to as “generic margin” refers to price discounts rebates and other incentives we receive from manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals generally are highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices tend to decline over time although this may vary 

bulk and nonbulk customers  the pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk customers bulk customers consist of retail chain customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses all other customers are classified as nonbulk customers a retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a nonbulk customer with respect to its retail stores 

bulk customers can process large quantities of products in central locations substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of products shipped in the same form that we receive them from the manufacturer a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping in contrast nonbulk customers require more complex servicing for nonbulk customers we may receive inventory in large or full case quantities and break it down into smaller quantities warehouse the product for a longer period of time pick individual products specific to a customer’s order and deliver that smaller order to a customer location 

bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk customers bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than nonbulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and due to lower costs related to the fewer services we provide in 

  

addition sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to nonbulk customers because bulk customers’ orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by the impact of branded manufacturer margin and manufacturer cash discounts branded manufacturer margin is lower due to the shorter time that products sold to bulk customers are held in inventory by us allowing less opportunity for pharmaceutical price appreciation segment distribution selling general and administrative “sga” expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from nonbulk customers because deliveries to bulk customers require substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than deliveries to nonbulk customers 

the following table shows the revenues segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk customers for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

  

  see note 16 to the “notes consolidated financial statements” for pharmaceutical segment revenue profit and assets for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

medical segment 

the medical segment distributes a broad range of medical surgical and laboratory products to hospitals surgery centers laboratories physician offices and other healthcare providers this segment also develops manufactures and sources our own line of medical and surgical products these products include sterile and nonsterile procedure kits singleuse surgical drapes gowns and apparel exam and surgical gloves and fluid suction and collection systems our medical and surgical products are sold directly or through thirdparty distributors in the united states canada europe south america and the asiapacific region 

see note 16 to the “notes consolidated financial statements” for medical segment revenue profit and assets for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

in the past five fiscal years we completed the following two significant acquisitions both of which were transferred to carefusion as part of the spinoff 

 

  

    we also completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years including 

 

  

  

 on june 9 2010 we entered into an agreement to acquire healthcare solutions holding llc which provides specialty healthcare services on july 15 2010 we completed that acquisition for a 517 million cash payment the acquisition agreement also includes earnout payments of up to 150 million over the next three years 

we completed several divestiture transactions during the past five fiscal years including 

 

  

 customers 

our largest customers walgreen co “walgreens” and cvs caremark corporation “cvs” accounted for approximately 24 and 22 respectively of our revenue for fiscal 2010 the aggregate of our five largest customers including walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately 57 of our revenue for fiscal 2010 

we have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with 

  

novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp arrangements with these two gpos accounted for approximately 15 of our revenue for fiscal 2010 although gpo vendor selections may influence member sourcing decisions gpo members generally are not required to comply with those vendor selections accordingly we believe that the loss of an agreement with a gpo would not cause the loss of sales to all members of the gpo 

suppliers 

we rely on many different suppliers products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 20 of our revenue during fiscal 2010 but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 6 of that revenue overall we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good the loss of some suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if alternative sources were unavailable at reasonable prices 

the pharmaceutical distribution business is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these agreements generally have terms ranging from one year with an automatic renewal feature to five years generally these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree if there is an uncured breach of the agreement or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 

our pharmaceutical segment’s nuclear pharmacy services business dispenses several products prepared using a particular radioisotope at the present time it is difficult to acquire sufficient quantities of that radioisotope from third party suppliers because of a continued and prolonged shortage of a critical raw material used to derive that radioisotope from two nuclear reactors which are experiencing prolonged downtimes based on information obtained from parties involved with the two affected nuclear reactors we anticipate the supply of raw material to normalize in the first half of fiscal 2011 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products we compete on many levels including service offerings support services breadth of product lines and price 

in the pharmaceutical segment we compete with two other national fullline wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains direct selling manufacturers specialty distributors thirdparty logistics companies and nuclear pharmacies among others in addition the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals including telemarketers 

in the medical segment we compete with many different distributors including owens  minor inc thermo fisher scientific inc pss world medical inc henry schein inc and medline industries inc in addition we compete with a number of regional medical products distributors and with thirdparty logistics companies competitors of the medical segment’s development and manufacturing business include kimberlyclark corporation ansell limited deroyal industries inc medline industries inc and mölnlycke health care 

employees 

as of june 30 2010 we had approximately 22600 employees in the united states and approximately 8600 employees outside of the united states overall we consider our employee relations to be good 

  

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products services and intangible assets we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties all of these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations we enforce our intellectual property rights when they are infringed by others and will continue to do so where appropriate 

we have applied in the united states and other countries for registration of a number of trademarks and service marks some of our marks are registered but our applications may not always be granted we also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks 

we hold patents relating to aspects of our distribution operations including our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings we also hold patents relating to medical and surgical products and devices such as fluid suction and irrigation devices surgical waste management systems surgical and medical examination gloves surgical drapes gowns and facial protection products and patient temperature management products 

we have a number of pending patent applications in the united states and other countries and we intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate we may not always obtain the patents for which we apply we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

regulatory matters 

our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries depending upon their specific business and where they distribute manufacture and sell their products our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal they can require us to suspend distribution of products and controlled substances or initiate product recalls they can seize products or impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions and they can seek injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products 

distribution the dea fda and various state authorities regulate the marketing purchase storage and distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances under various state and federal statutes including the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging storage and distribution of controlled substances 

manufacturing and marketing our subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable foreign agencies including regulations regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices and quality systems in addition our medical segment’s international manufacturing operations may be subject to local certification requirements 

  

the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements covering the design testing safety effectiveness manufacture labeling promotion and advertising distribution and postmarket surveillance of certain of our manufactured products we need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities before we can market and sell many of our products in particular countries even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory review 

to assess and facilitate compliance with federal state and foreign regulatory requirements we routinely review our quality and compliance systems to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify areas for improvement or remediation as part of our quality review we assess the suppliers of raw materials components and finished goods that are incorporated into the medical devices we manufacture in addition we conduct quality management reviews designed to highlight key issues that may affect the quality of our products and services from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action such as withdrawing the product from the market correcting the product at the customer location revising product labeling and notifying customers 

nuclear pharmacies and related businesses our nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities require licenses or permits from the nrc the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate and the state board of pharmacy in addition the fda regulates cyclotron facilities the fda issued regulations effective december 11 2011 establishing current good manufacturing practices for positron emission tomography “pet” drugs 

prescription drug pedigree tracking 

state and federal agencies are concerned about preventing the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the pharmaceutical supply chain some states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their options the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards to identify and validate technologies for securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies in march 2010 the fda issued guidance establishing standardized numerical identifiers “sni” for prescription pharmaceutical packages 

in december 2006 we entered into a settlement to resolve a civil investigation by the new york attorney general’s office focusing on sales and purchases of prescription pharmaceuticals in the secondary market pursuant to the settlement we implemented a number of reforms within the pharmaceutical distribution business including requirements that customers who are wholesalers certify their compliance with our wholesaler safe product practices 

healthcare fraud and abuse laws 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations generally prohibit us and others in our industry from soliciting offering receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order or purchase items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs we also cannot submit or cause to be submitted any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government certain of our subsidiaries also maintain contracts with the federal government and are subject to regulatory requirements relating to government contractors 

health information practices 

services and products provided by some of our businesses involve access to patient identifiable healthcare information in the past few years federal and state officials have focused on the questions of how patient 

  

identifiable healthcare information should be handled which entities should compile that information and how that work should proceed changes in legislation such as the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and its accompanying regulations may affect how some information services or products are provided the health information technology for economic and clinical health act adopted in february 2009 augmented hipaa by increasing existing healthcare privacy requirements including expanding hipaa’s reach to cover additional entities requiring certain notifications if there is a breach of patient information and increasing penalties associated with noncompliance in addition certain jurisdictions where we do business regulate personal data protection and how information services or products are provided 

franchising laws 

our franchising operations through medicine shoppe international inc and medicap pharmacies incorporated collectively “medicine shoppe” are subject to regulation by the federal trade commission in addition many states have laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship 

environmental laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and we have made and will continue to make necessary expenditures to comply with applicable laws at the present time we are participating in cleaning up environmental contamination at several sites none of which are material to us 

health and safety laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and recommendations both in the united states and other countries relating to safe working conditions laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 

laws relating to foreign trade 

various us and international laws and regulations require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 

similarly we are subject to laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act foreign antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of internal books and records these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced some governmental corruption 

other information 

our distribution businesses generally are not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 

our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value or that can be returned to vendors for credit 

we offer market payment terms to our customers

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows these are not the only risks we face our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 

we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 

as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 above we operate in markets that are highly competitive because of competition our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as enhanced cost control measures our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this consolidation trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may adversely impact our results of operations 

we have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue 

as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 above our sales and credit concentration is significant for example walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately 24 and 22 respectively of our revenue for fiscal 2010 the aggregate of our five largest customers including walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately 57 of our revenue for fiscal 2010 in addition walgreens and cvs accounted for 32 and 21 respectively of our gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2010 if one or more of our large customers default in payment terminate or do not renew contracts or significantly reduce their purchases of our products our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 

in addition approximately 15 of our revenue for fiscal 2010 was derived through the contractual arrangements established with two gpos novation and premier gpo members generally are not required to comply with gpo vendor selections still the loss of an agreement with a gpo could cause us to lose customers which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our pharmaceutical segment’s margin may be affected by prices established by manufacturers or market forces that are beyond our control 

as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 we generate a portion of our branded manufacturer margin from pharmaceutical price appreciation if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by smaller amounts or restrict the amount of inventory available to us we will earn less branded manufacturer margin 

  

in addition prices for generic pharmaceuticals distributed by our pharmaceutical distribution business tend to decline over time which could have an adverse effect on our generic manufacturer margin 

the us healthcare environment is changing in many ways some of which may not be favorable to us as a result of recent federal healthcare legislation 

our products and services are primarily intended to function within the current structure of the healthcare industry in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to control costs the use of managed care has increased medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined distributors manufacturers healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and large sophisticated purchasing groups have become more prevalent 

in march 2010 congress approved and the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “healthcare reform acts” among other things the healthcare reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured americans many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until 2014 including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the healthcare reform acts could affect us adversely the healthcare reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid beginning in 2013 each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices we manufacture and sell devices that will be subject to this tax additionally the healthcare reform acts changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than 175 of the average weighted manufacturer’s price “amp” from 250 of the lowest average manufacturer’s price for generic pharmaceuticals the amp provision is expected to become effective in october 2010 we could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical devices or healthcare services 

our business requires consistent diligent and rigorous compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated as described above in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item 1 we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries many of our subsidiaries are required to register for permits or licenses with and to comply with operating and security standards of regulatory agencies if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 

 

  

  

   

 we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of many jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed including proposals to repeal lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate or tax payments tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others we may not be able to defend these challenges successfully which may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 

our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 

we rely on information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities including our national logistics center our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or actions of third parties or fail for any extended period of time 

the medical segment is working on a medical business transformation project which includes a new information system for supply chain and manufacturing related processes the medical segment is planning to transition selected processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2012 and 2013 if the system is not effectively implemented or fails to operate as intended it could adversely affect the medical segment’s supply chain and manufacturing operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

because of the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

due to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in legal proceedings for instance some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could harm our cash flows or results of operations 

  

acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be 

historically an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition we may encounter unforeseen accounting or internal control over financial reporting issues or the acquired business may have regulatory or compliance issues that we did not anticipate 

we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 

we depend on various components compounds raw materials and energy including radioisotopes and oil oilrelated and other commodities supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated a sustained interruption in the flow of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business in addition while we have processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations 

our manufacturing businesses use oil oilrelated and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs oil and gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years so our costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated because the healthcare industry is highly competitive and many customers and thirdparty payors have instituted costcontainment initiatives we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations are subject to a number of economic political and regulatory risks 

our global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition political changes can disrupt our supply chain—as well as our customers and operating activities—in a particular location we may not be able to enter into hedges or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks and any hedges that we enter into or insurance that we are able to obtain may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 

in addition our global operations are subject to risks arising from violations of us laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those that may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within certain countries or with certain counterparties if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties 

risks associated with the spinoff of carefusion 

this section describes some of the risks that exist as a result of the spinoff of carefusion which is described in greater detail in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k 

carefusion may not satisfy all of its contractual obligations  we entered into a number of agreements with carefusion that govern the rights and obligations of the parties following the spinoff we have certain rights under those agreements including indemnification against certain liabilities allocated to carefusion the failure of carefusion to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the transaction may have unexpected tax consequences  in connection with the spinoff we received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” in addition we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel similarly the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in stock ownership of either cardinal health or carefusion if the spinoff is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities 

we may not be able to capture the full benefits from our minority investment in carefusion as of june 30 2010 we owned approximately 305 million carefusion shares as with any investment in a publicly traded company this investment is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to carefusion’s business as disclosed in carefusion’s filings with the sec in addition we entered into an agreement in connection with the spinoff under which we committed to vote all of our carefusion shares in proportion to the votes cast by carefusion’s other shareholders and we do not have any representation on carefusion’s board of directors as a result we are not able to exert control or influence over carefusion to act in a manner that we may believe best for protecting or enhancing the value of our investment 

under the private letter ruling from the irs relating to the spinoff we must dispose of the carefusion shares as soon as practicable after the spinoff and consistent with our reasons for retaining the shares but no later than august 31 2014 as a result we may be required to sell some or all of the shares at a time when we might not otherwise choose to do so additionally any disposition of carefusion shares by us in the public market or the perception that such dispositions could occur could adversely affect prevailing market prices for carefusion shares and adversely affect the value or the terms and conditions of such disposition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are referring to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

we are a 985 billion global company serving the healthcare industry with products and services that help hospitals physician offices and pharmacies reduce costs improve safety and productivity and deliver better care to patients we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 

our 2010 fiscal year was a significant transition year as we completed the spinoff of carefusion transitioned to a new management team commenced a number of key programs to enhance and refocus our operations and responded to the challenging economic environment and uncertain healthcare industry landscape during fiscal 2010 our medical segment profit grew by 11 percent while continuing to make key strategic investments our pharmaceutical segment profit declined by 3 percent primarily due to pricing changes on renewed customer contracts the negative impact of actions we took to improve our strategic positioning the negative impact from the yearoveryear value of generic launches and a severe supply shortage in nuclear pharmacy these items were largely offset by our execution on major programs and disciplined cost controls 

our cash and equivalents balance was 28 billion at june 30 2010 compared to 12 billion at june 30 2009 the increase was primarily derived from net cash provided by operating activities of 20 billion as a result of earnings and very successful working capital management in fiscal 2010 

we plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to create shareholder value this includes reinvesting in the business during fiscal 2010 we made capital expenditures totaling 260 million with the majority being in the area of information technology projects we may seek to complement our internal capabilities or scale with acquisitions such as the acquisition of healthcare solutions holding llc “p4 healthcare” that we recently completed during early fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2010 we paid quarterly dividends of 0175 per share or 070 per share on an annualized basis on may 5 2010 the board of directors approved an 11 percent increase in the quarterly dividend beginning in july 2010 in fiscal 2010 we also repurchased 250 million of shares of which 20 million cash settled in july 2010 

trends 

as we enter fiscal 2011 we expect low singledigit growth in the primary markets that we serve actual revenue growth realized in our two segments may vary from market trends based on customer gains and losses product and customer sales mix shifts and growth of the specific customers that we serve 

our gross margin has been relatively flat over the past three years and decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily as a result of competitive pressures we began a number of business programs to improve gross margin and increase the sales of higher margin products which had some success in fiscal 2010 going forward our gross margin could be influenced by the rates of growth in our key markets product and customer sales mix competitive pricing intensity sourcing activity the rate and value of generic pharmaceutical launches and price changes for our products including generic and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation or deflation 

our pharmaceutical segment’s nuclear pharmacy services business dispenses several products prepared using a particular radioisotope at the present time it is difficult to acquire sufficient quantities of that 

  

radioisotope from third party suppliers because of a continued and prolonged shortage of a critical raw material used to derive that radioisotope from two nuclear reactors which are experiencing prolonged downtimes based on information obtained from parties involved with the two affected nuclear reactors we anticipate the supply of raw material to normalize in the first half of fiscal 2011 

within the medical segment variability in the cost of raw materials such as oil oilrelated and other commodities can have a significant impact on the cost of products sold in fiscal 2011 we anticipate a negative yearoveryear impact from higher commodity prices 

in march 2010 congress approved and the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act the “health reform acts” the health reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured americans many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until 2014 including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance although we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services the overall effect of the provisions of the health reform acts on us is uncertain and could be adverse the health reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid we could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals medical devices or healthcare services in addition beginning in 2013 each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices we manufacture and sell medical devices that will be subject to this tax 

acquisitions and divestitures 

in july 2010 subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010 we completed the acquisition of p4 healthcare for a cash payment of 517 million the acquisition agreement also includes earnout payments of up to 150 million over the next three years with this acquisition we plan to expand our presence in specialty pharmaceutical services and distribution p4 healthcare’s results will be reported within our pharmaceutical segment 

we consider acquisitions to expand our role as a provider of services and innovative products to the healthcare industry especially those that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and strengthen the acquired business there can be no assurance however that we will be able to successfully take advantage of any such opportunity if and when it arises or consummate any such transaction if pursued as additional transactions are pursued or consummated we would incur additional acquisition related charges and may need to enter into funding arrangements for such acquisitions there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction will be successful 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we sold our united kingdombased martindale injectable manufacturing business “martindale” for 141 million 

spinoff of carefusion corporation 

on august 31 2009 we separated the clinical and medical products businesses from our other businesses through a pro rata distribution to shareholders of approximately 81 of the then outstanding shares of carefusion common stock the “spinoff” we retained certain surgical and exam gloves surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses that were previously part of our clinical and medical products business as explained elsewhere in this form 10k the spinoff had a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

during fiscal 2010 we sold approximately 109 million shares of the 414 million shares of carefusion common stock that we held immediately after the spinoff for 271 million which resulted in a gross pretax realized gain of approximately 45 million as of june 30 2010 our ownership of approximately 305 million 

  

shares of carefusion common stock had an estimated fair value of 692 million under the private letter ruling from the irs relating to the spinoff we must dispose of the carefusion shares as soon as practicable after the spinoff and consistent with our reasons for retaining the shares but no later than august 31 2014 carefusion has registered the carefusion stock we own with the sec although we may sell the stock under an exemption from registration 

the net assets of carefusion are presented separately as assets from businesses held for sale and discontinued operations and its operating results are presented within discontinued operations for all reporting periods through the date of the spinoff 

our continuing relationship with carefusion 

on july 22 2009 we entered into a separation agreement with carefusion to effect the spinoff and provide a framework for our relationship with carefusion after the spinoff in addition on august 31 2009 we entered into a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement intellectual property agreements and certain other commercial agreements with carefusion these agreements including the separation agreement provide for the allocation of assets employees liabilities and obligations including investments property and employee benefits and taxrelated assets and liabilities attributable to periods prior to at and after the spinoff and govern certain relationships between carefusion and us after the spinoff 

pursuant to our transition services agreement with carefusion for fiscal 2010 we recognized approximately 99 million in transition service fee income which approximately offsets the costs associated with providing the transition services additionally during fiscal 2010 we purchased 606 million of carefusion trade receivables pursuant to an accounts receivable factoring arrangement between carefusion and us 

under the tax matters agreement in connection with the spinoff carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spinoff as of june 30 2010 we have a 245 million indemnification receivable on our balance sheet related to this item 

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

pharmaceutical segment 

pharmaceutical segment revenue was positively impacted by pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers a combined impact of 34 billion partially offset by losses of customers in excess of gains 13 billion 

revenue from nonbulk customers was 458 billion 441 billion and 422 billion for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively revenue from bulk customers was 440 billion 437 billion and 373 billion for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see item 1 business for more information about bulk and nonbulk customers 

  

medical segment 

medical segment revenue was positively impacted by increased volume from existing hospital laboratory and ambulatory care customers 462 million driven partially by strong demand for flurelated products also positively impacting revenue were new products 74 million and the favorable impact of foreign exchange 55 million in addition in connection with the spinoff we recognized previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion of 51 million prior to the spinoff we deferred revenue for products sold to carefusion businesses until the products were sold to the end customers losses of existing customers in excess of gains from new customers reduced revenue by 200 million 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

pharmaceutical segment 

pharmaceutical segment revenue was positively impacted by pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers a combined impact of 78 billion revenue was negatively impacted by lost customer revenue from the dea’s suspensions of licenses to distribute controlled substances held by three of our distribution centers and because of enhanced controlled substance antidiversion efforts that we undertook we resumed controlled substance distributions from distribution centers that were impacted by the license suspensions during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 

medical segment 

medical segment revenue was positively impacted by increased volume from existing hospital laboratory and ambulatory care customers 386 million revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange 88 million 

cost of products sold 

consistent with the increases in revenue our cost of products sold increased 25 billion or 3 during fiscal 2010 and increased by 86 billion or 10 during fiscal 2009 

gross margin 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

pharmaceutical segment 

gross margin decreased 65 million as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 medical segment 

gross margin increased 95 million as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

pharmaceutical segment 

gross margin increased by 48 million as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

  

 medical segment 

gross margin decreased 69 million as a result of the factors listed below 

 

  

 distribution selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

increased sga during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in our management incentive compensation in fiscal 2010 we had incentive compensation accruals that were 46 million above plan due to better than expected consolidated performance compared with incentive compensation accruals that were 36 million below plan in fiscal 2009 in addition we incurred increased spending on strategic projects 51 million sga expense growth was significantly mitigated by cost control measures instituted in fiscal 2009 and reduced bad debt expense 25 million included within sga were 11 million and 5 million of costs related to the spinoff for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

cost control programs enabled us to decrease sga expenses in fiscal 2009 by 7 million even though we incurred higher bad debt expense 38 million the increased bad debt expense was due to poor economic conditions affecting certain customers and four regional chain customers of our pharmaceutical segment filing for bankruptcy 

segment profit and operating earnings 

 

 segment profit 

we evaluate the performance of the individual segments based upon among other things segment profit which is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold less segment sga expenses we do not allocate restructuring and employee severance acquisition related costs impairments and gainloss on sale of assets litigation creditscharges net certain investment and other spending to our segments these costs are retained at corporate investment spending generally includes the first year spend for certain projects which require incremental strategic investments in the form of additional operating expenses we encourage our segments to identify investment projects which will promote innovation and provide future returns as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management the expenses for such projects are retained at corporate in addition spinoff costs included within sga are not allocated to our segments 

pharmaceutical segment 

the principal drivers for the decrease during fiscal 2010 were pricing changes on renewed customer contracts fewer significant generic pharmaceutical launches than the prior year and the medicine shoppe franchise transformation the decline in segment profit was partially offset by contributions from our generic programs disciplined cost controls and solid branded margin growth 

the principal drivers for the increase during fiscal 2009 were increased volume and contributions from new generic launches the increase was partially offset by pricing changes on renewed customer contracts the impact from antidiversion activities and bad debt expense 

segment profits from sales to bulk customers as a percentage of pharmaceutical segment profit were 11 17 and 15 in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 the decrease from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was due to pricing changes on renewed bulk customer contracts 

medical segment 

the principal drivers for the increase during fiscal 2010 were growth in sales to certain existing customers and decreased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements segment profit growth was partially dampened from increased spending on strategic projects 

the decrease during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements and the negative impact of foreign exchange 

  

consolidated operating earnings 

in addition to revenue gross margin and sga discussed above operating earnings were impacted by the following 

 

 fiscal 2010 

 

  

  

 fiscal 2009 

 

 fiscal 2008 

 

  

  

   

earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations 

in addition to items discussed above earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

 

  

  

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

 

  

   

provision for income taxes 

generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and us state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a charge of 168 million or 139 percentage points attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore the fiscal 2010 effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by 18 percentage points due to changes in our business mix which resulted in a higher percentage of our pretax income being generated in the us than in lower tax rate international jurisdictions a favorable audit settlement with a state taxing authority in fiscal 2009 see below also unfavorably impacted the yearoveryear comparison of the effective tax rate 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 34 percentage points due to changes in our business mix which resulted in a higher percentage of our pretax income being generated in the us than in lower tax rate international jurisdictions the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by 14 percentage points due to an audit settlement with a state taxing authority in addition the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by 31 percentage points due to the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset established for a capital loss carryforward 

ongoing audits 

the irs currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007 we have received proposed adjustments from the irs related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us the irs proposed additional taxes of 598 million excluding penalties and interest if this tax ultimately must be paid carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement for 462 million of the total amount we disagree with these proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them but we believe our reserves for these matters are adequate 

earnings from discontinued operations 

earnings from discontinued operations were 55 million for fiscal 2010 carefusion operating results are included within earnings from discontinued operations for all periods through the date of the spinoff earnings from discontinued operations net of tax decreased by 60 million during fiscal 2009 primarily because carefusion’s earnings declined—in large part because hospitals deferred capital spending see note 5 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on discontinued operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently believe that based upon available capital resources cash on hand and ownership of shares of carefusion common stock projected operating cash flow and access to committed credit facilities we have adequate access to capital resources to fund working capital needs currently anticipated capital expenditures business growth and expansion contractual obligations current and projected debt service requirements dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we acquired p4 healthcare using cash on hand if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions depending on the size and timing of such transactions we may need supplemental funding 

capital resources 

cash and equivalents 

our cash and equivalents balance was 28 billion at june 30 2010 compared to 12 billion at june 30 2009 the increase was primarily derived from net cash provided by operating activities of 20 billion net cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by net earnings and changes in working capital changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors during the regular course of business 

we use days sales outstanding “dso” days inventory on hand “dioh” and days payable outstanding “dpo to evaluate our working capital performance dso is calculated as trade receivables net divided by average daily revenue during the last month of the reporting period dioh is calculated as inventories divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period chargeback billings are the difference between a product’s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price established between the vendors and the end customer 

 

 focused efforts to manage customer accounts and reduce delinquency rates have led to improved dso the significant improvement in dioh was largely due to enhanced efficiency in our supply chain operations to reduce inventory requirements the change in dpo during fiscal 2010 was largely driven by a change in payable terms with a supplier in our pharmaceutical segment 

during fiscal 2010 we deployed 260 million on capital expenditures 253 million on dividends and 230 million on share repurchases an additional 20 million repurchased during fiscal 2010 settled during fiscal 2011 as part of our balanced capital deployment strategy during fiscal 2010 we received 271 million in proceeds from sale of carefusion common stock and 154 million from the divestitures of our martindale business in the united kingdom and specialtyscripts in addition we completed a debt tender resulting in the purchase of more than 11 billion debt securities using cash of 14 billion distributed to us from carefusion in connection with the spinoff 

  

during fiscal 2009 we deployed 421 million on capital expenditures 301 million on repayment of longterm obligations and 200 million on dividends during fiscal 2008 we deployed 12 billion on share repurchases 189 million on capital expenditures and 173 million on dividends also during fiscal 2008 we received 300 million from the issuance of longterm obligations and 228 million from shares issued under our sharebased compensation plans 

the cash and equivalents balance at the end of fiscal 2010 included 398 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations as a us parent company we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax by taking intercompany loans the previously disclosed cash held by our foreign subsidiaries does not include intercompany loans of 844 million and 237 million from our foreign entities which are currently planned to be repaid by fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

the net cash provided by discontinued operations for fiscal 2010 of 14 billion primarily reflected permanent financing obtained by carefusion prior to the spinoff offset by 90 million cash funding provided by us to carefusion pursuant to the spinoff separation agreement net cash provided byused in discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 and 2008 of 341 million and 224 million respectively primarily related to the earnings and changes in working capital for carefusion 

ownership of shares of carefusion common stock 

during fiscal 2010 we sold approximately 109 million shares of the 414 million shares of carefusion common stock that we held immediately after the spinoff which resulted in cash proceeds of 271 million as of june 30 2010 our remaining 305 million shares of carefusion common stock had an estimated fair value of 692 million under the private letter ruling from the irs relating to the spinoff we must dispose of the carefusion shares as soon as practicable after the spinoff and consistent with our reasons for retaining the shares but no later than august 31 2014 carefusion has registered the carefusion stock owned by us with the sec although we may sell the stock under an exemption from registration 

credit facilities and commercial paper 

our sources of liquidity include a 15 billion revolving credit facility and a 950 million committed receivables sales facility program we also have a commercial paper program of up to 15 billion backed by the revolving credit facility we had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june 30 2010 our ability to access the commercial paper market is limited based on our current credit rating from moody’s investor services 

our revolving credit facility and receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of any fiscal quarter end of at least 4to1 and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 325to1 as of june 30 2010 we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

longterm obligations 

as of june 30 2010 we had total longterm obligations of 21 billion compared to 36 billion at june 30 2009 the decrease in longterm obligations was primarily driven by the debt tender completed in september 2009 resulting in the purchase of more than 11 billion debt securities additionally in october 2009 we repaid our 350 million floating rate notes that had reached their maturity 

during fiscal 2009 we repaid 150 million of 625 notes that had reached their maturity and we also repaid 149 million for the preferred debt securities 

  

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 of 260 million 421 million and 189 million respectively primarily related to information technology projects and investments to improve the efficiency of our distribution facilities fiscal 2009 capital expenditures included 151 million to repurchase assets under an operating lease arrangement 

we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 to be generally in line with the level of spending in fiscal 2010 we anticipate that we will be able to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities fiscal 2011 capital expenditures will be largely focused on information technology projects 

dividends 

during fiscal 2010 we paid quarterly dividends of 0175 per share or 070 per share on an annualized basis on may 5 2010 our board of directors approved an 11 percent increase in the quarterly dividend to 0195 per share or 078 per share on an annualized basis payable on july 15 2010 to shareholders of record on july 1 2010 on august 4 2010 our board of directors approved our 104th consecutive regular quarterly dividend 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 250 million of our common shares of which 20 million cash settled in july 2010 during july and august 2010 we repurchased an additional 250 million of our common shares which completes share repurchases under our current board authorization we funded the repurchases through available cash 

during fiscal 2009 we did not repurchase any of our common shares during fiscal 2008 we repurchased approximately 11 billion of our common shares a portion of the aftertax net proceeds of approximately 31 billion from the sale of our pts business were used to repurchase shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

interest rate and currency risk management 

we use foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability we also use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt see item 7a below as well as notes 1 and 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency interest rate and commodity exposures 

contractual obligations 

as of june 30 2010 our contractual obligations including estimated payments due by period are as follows 

 

  

   

    offbalance sheet arrangements 

see “liquidity and capital resources—capital resources” above and note 18 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” which is incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of offbalance sheet arrangements 

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations for continuing operations and ii require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because our estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables—amounts owed to us through our operating activities—are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 90 days to 10 years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

  

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 

the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 

 

 a hypothetical 01 increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables salestype leases and finance notes receivables at june 30 2010 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 53 million 

we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

inventories 

a substantial portion of inventories 73 at june 30 2010 and 74 at june 30 2009 is stated at the lower of cost using the lifo “last in first out” method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time so our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time so our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation in fiscal 2010 and 2009 we did not record any lifo reserve reductions 

the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the fifo “first in first out” method or market 

if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 in fact primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline inventories at lifo were 377 million and 349 million higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively however we do not record inventories in excess of current market value 

  

inventories recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 344 million at june 30 2010 and 395 million at june 30 2009 we determine reserves for inventory obsolescence based on historical experiences sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required however these reserves are unlikely to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and other intangibles 

purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives—primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks—continue to be amortized over their useful lives impairment testing involves a comparison of estimated fair value to the respective carrying amount if estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment which would be recorded as an expense to our results of operations 

application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including but not limited to the identification of reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment in fiscal 2010 we identified three reporting units pharmaceutical segment excluding our nuclear and pharmacy services division medical segment and nuclear and pharmacy services division fair values can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of incomebased and marketbased approaches under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the incomeapproach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return to further confirm the fair value we compare our aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 

we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2010 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value due to the spinoff and reorganization of the reporting units goodwill was also tested for impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 based on this analysis there was no impairment we also performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2009 and 2008 using similar fair value approaches however our marketbased approach historically included a review of the priceearnings ratio for publicly traded companies that were similar in nature scope and size to our reporting units to the extent available based on this analysis there was no impairment see note 6 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

if we alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2010 or 2009 

vendor reserves 

in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our 

  

estimate methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

vendor reserves were 268 million at june 30 2010 and 536 million at june 30 2009 approximately 57 of the vendor reserve at june 30 2010 pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 80 at the end of fiscal 2009 the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period to period timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies 

the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the following table presents information about our tax position 

 

  

 expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 

tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a detailed disclosure of the unrecognized tax benefits 

if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease by 121 million for fiscal 2010 

sharebased compensation 

all sharebased payments to employees including grants of options are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award the fair value of stock options is 

  

determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides for better estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 

during 2010 we calculated separate option valuations for two separate groups of employees during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees the groups were determined using similar historical exercise behaviors the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant 7 years as required the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange interest rate and commodity related changes we maintain a comprehensive hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk see notes 1 and 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

by nature of our global operations our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell products throughout the world our foreign currency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar european euro mexican peso and thai baht 

transactional exposure 

our businesses’ transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries as part of our risk management program at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year the fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 analyses utilize a currency portfolio model encompassing both implied volatility and historical correlation to estimate the net potential gain or loss these analyses included the estimated impact of our hedging program which mitigates our businesses’ transactional exposure at june 30 2010 and 2009 we had hedged approximately 45 and 46 respectively of our businesses’ transactional exposures the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to our businesses’ transactional exposure in millions 

 

 translational exposure 

our businesses also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars our functional currency we perform a similar analysis as described above related to this 

  

translational exposure we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june 30 2010 and 2009 the following table summarizes our businesses’ translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the us dollar in millions 

 

 interest rate sensitivity 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 

as part of our risk management program we annually perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates at june 30 2010 and 2009 the potential increase or decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 03 million and 01 million respectively 

commodity price sensitivity 

we purchase certain commodities for use in our manufacturing and distribution processes which include latex nitrile diesel fuel and polypropylene among others we typically purchase these commodities at market prices and as a result are affected by price fluctuations as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year at june 30 2010 and 2009 we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices as of june 30 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 we also have exposure to certain energy related commodities including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business these exposures result primarily from operating our distribution manufacturing and corporate facilities in certain deregulated markets we from time to time enter into longterm purchase contracts to supply these items at a specific price

reportable segments to three segments pharmaceutical medical and carefusion effective upon the spinoff the company will change its reportable segments to two segments pharmaceutical and medical the following business discussion is based on the three reportable segments as they were structured for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

healthcare supply chain services 

pharmaceutical supply chain business  through its pharmaceutical supply chain business the healthcare supply chain services segment distributes a broad line of branded and generic pharmaceutical products overthecounter healthcare products and consumer products collectively “pharmaceutical products” the pharmaceutical supply chain business also referred to as the pharmaceutical distribution business is one of the country’s leading fullservice wholesale distributors to retail customers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers hospitals and alternate care providers including mail order pharmacies located throughout the united states as a fullservice wholesale distributor the pharmaceutical supply chain business complements its distribution activities by offering a broad range of support services to assist its customers in maintaining and helping to improve the efficiency and quality of their services these support services include among others 

 

  

  

  

 the company’s proprietary software systems feature customized databases specially designed to help its pharmaceutical supply chain customers order more efficiently contain costs and monitor their purchases 

in addition the pharmaceutical supply chain business provides services to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers including distribution services inventory management services datareporting services new product launch support and contract and chargeback administration services the pharmaceutical supply chain business also operates a pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution program that provides repackaged pharmaceutical products to its customers 

nuclear pharmacy services business and other pharmaceutical supply chain businesses through its nuclear pharmacy services business the healthcare supply chain services segment also operates centralized nuclear pharmacies that prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics the healthcare supply chain services segment also provides thirdparty logistics support services distributes therapeutic plasma to hospitals clinics and other providers located in the united states and manufactures and markets generic pharmaceutical products for sale to hospitals clinics and pharmacies in the united kingdom the healthcare supply chain services segment also operates a specialty pharmacy that provides prescription fulfillment and clinical care services directly to individual patients requiring highly intensive therapies 

medical supply chain business  through its medical supply chain business the healthcare supply chain services segment distributes a broad range of branded and privatelabel medical and laboratory products as well as the company’s own line of surgical and respiratory therapy products manufactured by the clinical and medical products segment to hospitals laboratories and ambulatory care customers such as surgery centers and physician offices 

in addition the medical supply chain business helps customers reduce costs while improving the quality of patient care in a variety of ways including online procurement fulfillment and information provided through cardinalcom and supplychain management the medical supply chain business also assembles and distributes sterile and nonsterile procedure kits under the presource ® brand name 

  

pharmaceutical supply chain business model the healthcare supply chain services segment’s pharmaceutical supply chain business maintains prime vendor relationships with its customers that streamline the purchasing process for its customers by reducing the number of vendors using a prime vendor offers customers logistical savings and fosters partnerships between customer and distributor that result in greater efficiency and lower costs 

five primary factors influence the pharmaceutical supply chain business’ gross margin for pharmaceutical products customer discounts manufacturer cash discounts distribution service agreement fees manufacturer rebates and incentives and pharmaceutical price appreciation 

in general the company sells branded pharmaceutical products to its customers at a contract price that is based on the manufacturer’s published price or another designated price at the time of sale in either case the “manufacturer’s designated price” the contract price generally is determined by applying a discount to the manufacturer’s designated price the term “customer discounts” refers to the difference in dollars between the sales price to customers for pharmaceutical products net of discounts rebates and incentives given to customers and the manufacturer’s designated price for those pharmaceutical products sold in a particular period 

the term “manufacturer cash discounts” refers to the aggregate amount in dollars of cash incentives the company receives from manufacturers for prompt payment of invoices manufacturer cash discounts are typically a fixed percentage of the purchase price from the manufacturer 

the term “distribution service agreement fees” refers to aggregate fees paid by manufacturers for services provided by the company related to the distribution of the manufacturers’ products the company’s feeforservice arrangements are reflected in written distribution service agreements and may provide for a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price appreciation as described below in certain instances the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement the fee is typically a fixed percentage of either the company’s purchases from the manufacturer or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to its customers 

the term “pharmaceutical price appreciation” refers to the impact on gross margin in dollars of pharmaceutical price appreciation for pharmaceutical products sold during a particular period the impact happens when the company purchases inventory and the manufacturer subsequently increases its published price by virtue of the company’s contract price to customers being based upon the manufacturer’s designated price at the time of the sale the company then sells that inventory on hand at a higher price the company continues to generate a portion of its gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to the company could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the term “manufacturer rebates and incentives” refers to discounts the company receives from manufacturers as a result of competition among manufacturers including manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals in pricing their products manufacturer rebates and incentives are based on either the company’s purchases from the manufacturer or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to its customers the company generally earns the greatest margin dollars on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product in the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary 

therefore the company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business generates gross margin primarily to the extent that the selling price to its customers net of customer discounts exceeds in the aggregate the cost of products sold net of manufacturer cash discounts distribution service agreement fees pharmaceutical price appreciation and manufacturer rebates and incentives 

  

with respect to its customers the pharmaceutical supply chain business differentiates between bulk and nonbulk customers because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by nonbulk customers bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses all other customers are classified as nonbulk customers for example retail stores hospitals and alternate care sites bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as nonbulk customers 

see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information about the pharmaceutical supply chain business model

changes to reportable segments for fiscal 2010 

effective july 1 2009 the company changed its reportable segments to three segments pharmaceutical medical and carefusion the pharmaceutical segment encompasses the businesses previously within the healthcare supply chain services segment that distributed pharmaceutical radiopharmaceutical and overthecounter healthcare products as well as the businesses previously within the all other segment the medical segment encompasses the remaining businesses within the healthcare supply chain services segment as well as certain surgical and exam gloves surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses previously within the clinical and medical products segment the carefusion segment encompasses the businesses previously within the clinical and medical products segment excluding the abovereferenced surgical and exam gloves surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses and includes all businesses to be included in the spinoff upon completion of the spinoff the carefusion segment will be reported as discontinued operations and the company will operate with the two remaining segments 

acquisitions and divestitures 

from july 1 2004 to june 30 2009 the company completed the acquisitions described below 

 

  

    the company also has completed a number of other smaller acquisitions asset purchases stock purchases and mergers during the last five fiscal years including the following geodax technology inc during fiscal 2005 parmed pharmaceutical inc denver biomedical inc the wholesale pharmaceutical health and beauty and related drugstore products distribution business of f dohmen co and certain of its subsidiaries and the remaining shares of source medical corporation its canadian joint venture during fiscal 2006 medmined inc care fusion incorporated and specialtyscripts llc “specialtyscripts” during fiscal 2007 and borschow hospital  medical supplies inc during fiscal 2009 

on an ongoing basis the company evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and considers opportunities to expand its operations and services across all reportable segments these acquisitions may involve the use of cash stock or other securities as well as the assumption of indebtedness and liabilities 

from july 1 2004 to june 30 2009 the company completed several divestiture transactions these transactions include divesting the noncore domestic businesses of syncor international corporation “syncor” in several transactions since acquiring syncor in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2006 the company divested a significant portion of its specialty distribution business during fiscal 2007 the company completed the sale of its former pharmaceutical technologies and services segment other than certain genericfocused businesses the 

  

segment excluding the certain genericfocused businesses that were not sold is referred to as the “pts business” to an affiliate of the blackstone group at the closing of the pts business sale the company received approximately 32 billion in cash which represented the purchase price of approximately 33 billion as adjusted pursuant to certain provisions in the purchase agreement also during fiscal 2007 the company divested its healthcare marketing services business and its united kingdombased intercare pharmaceutical distribution business during fiscal 2008 the company divested its tecomet orthopedic implants and instruments and medsystems enteral devices and airway management products businesses 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and may decide to sell a business or product line based on such an evaluation see “spinoff of carefusion corporation” above for information on the company’s plans to spin off carefusion on august 31 2009 in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the company approved plans to divest the united kingdombased martindale injectable manufacturing business and specialtyscripts 

for additional information concerning certain of the transactions described above see notes 2 3 and 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” and “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

customers 

the company’s largest customers cvs caremark corporation “cvs” and walgreen co “walgreens” accounted for approximately 21 and 23 respectively of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2009 the aggregate of the company’s five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 54 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2009 all of the company’s business with its five largest customers is included in its healthcare supply chain services segment the loss of one or more of these five customers could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

businesses in each of the company’s reportable segments have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members approximately 16 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2009 was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation llc “novation” and premier purchasing partners lp “premier” the company’s two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue although gpo vendor selections are influential to gpo member sourcing decisions compliance by gpo members with those vendor selections is generally voluntary as such the company believes the loss of any of the company’s agreements with a gpo would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the gpo although the loss of such an agreement could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information regarding the company’s concentrations of credit risk and major customers 

suppliers 

the company obtains its products from many different suppliers products obtained from the company’s five largest suppliers accounted on a combined basis for approximately 22 of the company’s revenue during fiscal 2009 no one supplier’s products accounted for more than 6 of the company’s revenue in fiscal 2009 overall the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are good the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable prices 

the pharmaceutical supply chain business uses a feeforservice model with respect to the compensation it receives for the services it provides to pharmaceutical manufacturers these feeforservice arrangements are reflected in written distribution service agreements distribution service agreements between the company and pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a oneyear term with an automatic renewal feature to a five 

  

year term these agreements are generally only terminable prior to expiration of their term upon the following conditions the mutual agreement of the parties an uncured breach of the agreement or the occurrence of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period see the “pharmaceutical supply chain business model” discussion under “reportable segments—healthcare supply chain services” above for more information regarding distribution service agreement fees 

competition 

the company operates in markets that are highly competitive

declining economic conditions could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition

the company currently anticipates expenditures associated with the spinoff to be approximately 261 million on a pretax basis of which approximately 113 million were incurred in fiscal 2009 with the remainder expected to be incurred in fiscal 2010 and beyond these expenditures primarily consist of functional area separation costs standup costs employeerelated costs and other onetime transaction related costs approximately 222 million of these costs are expected to result in cash expenditures of which approximately 96 million were incurred during fiscal 2009 the company expects to fund the remainder of the costs through its current sources of liquidity including cash on hand the company expects the activities in connection with the spinoff to be completed by fiscal 2011 these estimated costs do not include costs expected to be incurred by carefusion following the spinoff

reasons for the spinoff 

the company’s board of directors believes that separating the clinical and medical products businesses from the remainder of the company is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders because such separation is expected to 

 

   

  

 the company’s board of directors considered a number of potentially negative factors in evaluating the separation including risks relating to the creation of a new public company possible increased costs and onetime separation costs but concluded that the potential benefits of the spinoff outweighed these factors

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses for fiscal 2009 increased 48 million or 1 driven by the impact of acquisitions net of divestitures 69 million and increased bad debt expense 40 million driven by the general economic conditions impacting certain customers and bankruptcy filings by four regional chain customers within the healthcare supply chain services segment the company is continuing to closely monitor its portfolio of outstanding accounts receivable to identify and mitigate customer credit risk however future results could be adversely impacted if there is a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more large customers the increases in sga expenses were largely offset by cost control initiatives refer to “segment results of operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting sga expenses in each of the company’s reportable segments

operating earnings increased 745 million or 55 during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to the 600 million expense recognized within special items in the prior year related to shareholder litigation in addition operating earnings were favorably impacted by higher gross margin 382 million and negatively impacted by increased sga expenses 329 million 

interest expense and other 

interest expense and other increased 49 million or 29 during fiscal 2009 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and other items 43 million 

on march 20 2009 the company terminated certain fixedtofloating interest rate swaps and received settlement proceeds totaling 123 million there was no immediate impact to the statement of earnings however the fair value adjustment to debt will be amortized over the life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense 

interest expense and other increased 49 million or 41 during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year interest expense and other was impacted during fiscal 2008 by increased borrowing levels 72 million and the impact of the prior year allocation of a portion of interest expense related to the pts business divestiture to discontinued operations 26 million the increase in interest expense for fiscal 2008 was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and other items 19 million and increased investment income 18 million 

provision for income taxes 

effective july 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin no 48” resulting in a 139 million reduction of retained earnings 

the company had 849 million and 763 million of unrecognized tax benefits at june 30 2009 and june 30 2008 respectively included in these balances are 611 million and 548 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would have an impact on the effective tax rate the remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility recognition of these tax benefits would not affect the 

  

company’s effective tax rate the company includes the full amount of unrecognized tax benefits in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2009 and 2008 is as follows 

 

 the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense as of june 30 2009 and june 30 2008 the company had 247 million and 195 million respectively accrued for the payment of interest and penalties these balances are gross amounts before any tax benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for the year ended june 30 2009 the company recognized 51 million of interest and penalties in the consolidated statement of earnings 

the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various us state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions the company is subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years ending june 30 2001 through the current fiscal year 

the internal revenue service “irs” currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007 during the three months ended december 31 2007 the company was notified that the irs has transferred jurisdiction over fiscal years 2001 and 2002 from the office of appeals back to the examinations level to reconsider previouslyunadjusted specific issues during the three months ended march 31 2008 the company received notices of proposed adjustment “npa’s” from the irs related to fiscal years 2001 through 2005 challenging deductions arising from the sale of trade receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity as described in more detail in note 9 the amount of additional tax excluding penalties and interest proposed by the irs in these notices was 179 million the company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest them the company anticipates that this transaction could be the subject of proposed adjustments by the irs in tax audits of fiscal years 2006 to present the company believes that it is adequately reserved for the uncertain tax position relating to this arrangement therefore it has not adjusted the amount of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue 

subsequent to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the company received a revenue agent’s report for tax years 2003 through 2005 which included the npa’s discussed above and new npa’s related to the company’s transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by the company the amount of additional tax proposed by the irs in the new notices total 598 million excluding penalties and interest the company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest them the company anticipates that this transaction could be the subject of proposed adjustments by the irs in tax audits of fiscal years 2006 to present the company believes that it is adequately reserved for the uncertain tax position relating to this arrangement therefore it has not adjusted the amount of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue 

it is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months due to activities of the irs or other taxing authorities including proposed assessments of 

  

additional tax possible settlement of audit issues or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations the company estimates that the range of the possible change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is a decrease of approximately zero to 24 million exclusive of penalties and interest

segment results of operations 

reportable segments 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 the company reorganized its businesses into three reportable segments — healthcare supply chain services clinical and medical products and all other — in order to reduce costs and align resources with the needs of each segment the healthcare supply chain services segment focuses on delivering bestinclass distribution and logistics services to its customers the segment generates approximately 94 of the company’s total segment revenue and approximately 64 of the company’s total segment profit as defined below in the “segment results of operations” section the clinical and medical products segment focuses largely on developing innovative products for hospitals and other providers of care the segment contributed approximately 32 of the company’s total segment profit the all other segment franchises and operates apothecarystyle retail pharmacies and provides pharmacy services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities all prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to this new financial reporting presentation 

the company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon among other things segment profit segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold less segment sga expenses segment sga expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions including corporate management corporate finance financial shared services human resources information technology legal and legislative affairs and an integrated hospital sales organization information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the segment level in addition special items and impairments gainloss on sale of assets and other net are not allocated to the segments see note 17 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on the company’s reportable segments

   healthcare supply chain services segment performance 

fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

healthcare supply chain services revenue growth of 86 billion or 10 during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to additional volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation the combined impact of these two factors was 80 billion the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 88 for the trailing twelve months ended june 30 2009 revenue was also positively impacted by the addition of new customers 954 million revenue growth was negatively impacted by the loss of customers 969 million lost customer revenue from the dea license suspensions and the company’s controlled substance antidiversion efforts also adversely affected revenue from nonbulk customers the company resumed controlled substance distributions from distribution centers that were impacted by the license suspensions during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 

  

healthcare supply chain services segment profit increased 5 million during fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year segment profit was positively impacted by an increase in gross margin of 56 million and negatively impacted by a 51 million increase in sga the increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of 164 million and increased manufacturer cash discounts 157 million the increased distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts were primarily the result of increased sales volume gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts 356 million as a result of sales growth including faster growth 17 of sales to bulk customers which tend to have larger customer discounts and customer repricings the company expects a certain level of continued pricing pressure due to the competitive market in which it operates sga expenses for the twelve months ended june 30 2009 increased slightly compared to prior year primarily due to increase in bad debt expense 38 million based on the general economic conditions impacting certain customers and bankruptcy filings by four regional chain customers partially offset by disciplined cost controls the increase in segment profit during fiscal 2009 was also partially due to the impact of acquisitions 11 million 

the company’s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline competitive pricing pressure intensifies the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases generic price deflation increases or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products decreases alternatively the company’s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase competitive pricing pressure subsides the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases generic price deflation decreases or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products increases 

the company expects certain factors to negatively impact fiscal 2010 including the timing of generic launches and price deflation the repricing of certain customer contracts and strategic positioning moves such as repositioning medicine shoppe and transitioning a significant vendor relationship to a distribution service agreement 

fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

healthcare supply chain services revenue growth of 33 billion or 4 during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to additional volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation the combined impact of these two factors was 48 billion the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 77 for the trailing twelve months ended june 30 2008 revenue was also positively impacted by the addition of new customers 583 million and the impact of foreign exchange 65 million revenue growth was negatively impacted by the loss of customers 21 billion and slower pharmaceutical market growth the dea license suspensions and the company’s controlled substance antidiversion efforts resulted in nonbulk customer losses and adversely affected the company’s ability to acquire new nonbulk customers 

healthcare supply chain services segment profit decreased 188 million or 12 during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year as a result of a decrease of 146 million in gross margin the decline in gross margin was primarily due to increased customer discounts 307 million which resulted from the repricing of several large customer contracts and faster growth 10 of sales to bulk customers which tend to have larger customer discounts also contributing to the decline in gross margin was a 2 decline in sales to nonbulk customers compared to fiscal 2007 revenue growth in fiscal 2008 was lower and weighted more toward growth in revenue from bulk customers lost customer revenue from the dea license suspensions and the company’s controlled substance antidiversion efforts also adversely affected gross margin during fiscal 2008 gross margin was also negatively impacted by decreased generic margin 35 million primarily due to the impact of generic launches in the prior year which did not occur in the current year the company generally earns the greatest margin dollars on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product to the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary offsetting the negative impact on gross margins described above were higher distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation of 84 million year over year due to increased sales volume and benefit from pharmaceutical price appreciation gross margin was also positively impacted during fiscal 2008 by increased 

  

manufacturer cash discounts 80 million due to increased sales volume the growth of distribution service agreement fees pharmaceutical price appreciation and manufacturer cash discounts was less than the growth in fiscal 2007 due to slower revenue growth 

increases in sga expenses decreased segment profit by 42 million during fiscal 2008 partially as a result of the impact of foreign exchange 10 million 

bulk and nonbulk customers  the healthcare supply chain services segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk customers with respect to the distribution of pharmaceutical radiopharmaceutical and overthecounter healthcare products because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by nonbulk customers hereinafter all references to bulk and nonbulk customers are confined to the product categories above bulk customers consist of retail chain customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses all other customers are classified as nonbulk customers for example retail stores pharmacies hospitals and alternate care sites bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as nonbulk customers a single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a nonbulk customer with respect to its retail stores bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and selfdistribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping nonbulk customers on the other hand require more complex servicing by the company these services all of which are performed by the company include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities warehousing the product for a longer period of time picking individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location 

the company tracks revenue by bulk and nonbulk customers in its financial systems an internal analysis has been prepared to estimate segment profit from bulk and nonbulk customers by allocating segment expenses total of segment cost of products sold and segment sga expenses separately for bulk and nonbulk customers the following table shows the allocation of segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk customers for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 prior period amounts differ from those previously disclosed as they have been updated to remove martindale which has been reclassified to discontinued operations 

 

  

   

 the following describes the allocation of the major components of cost of products sold for distribution between bulk and nonbulk customers 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the sga expenses for distribution between bulk and nonbulk customers as follows 

 

  

  

   

 the internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers because of lower pricing on sales for bulk customers and higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment sga expenses bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than nonbulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the company in addition sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to nonbulk customers because bulk customers’ orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue due to the mix of products sold pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which in turn results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was onhand at the time of the manufacturer’s price increase since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to nonbulk customers there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation consequently segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for nonbulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the company than deliveries to nonbulk customers as such segment sga expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from nonbulk customers however the lower sga expenses do not offset the higher cost of products sold and as a result segment profit as a percentage of revenue is significantly lower for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers 

the company defines bulk and nonbulk customers based on the way in which the company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers the company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the annual reports on form 10k of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers the company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may or may not use a different definition of bulk customers 

during fiscal 2009 revenue from nonbulk customers increased 19 billion due to increased volume from existing customers segment profit from nonbulk customers increased 6 million during fiscal 2009 due to increased manufacturer cash discounts and an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation partially offset by an increase in customer discounts 

during fiscal 2009 revenue from bulk customers increased 64 billion due to increased volume from existing customers and new customers segment profit from bulk customers decreased 3 million during fiscal 2009 due to increased customer discounts partially offset by an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased manufacturer cash discounts related to sales volume growth 

during fiscal 2008 revenue from nonbulk customers decreased 647 million compared to the prior year due to the loss of customers including the impact from the dea license suspensions and the company’s controlled substance antidiversion efforts partially offset by additional volume from existing customers segment profit from nonbulk customers decreased 147 million during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year due to an increase in customer discounts and the impact of generic launches in the prior year which did not occur in the current year coupled with greater generic deflation the decrease during fiscal 2008 was partially offset by an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation 

during fiscal 2008 revenue from bulk customers increased 34 billion compared to the prior year due to new contracts signed with existing customers which resulted in increased volume from existing customers 

  

segment profit from bulk customers decreased 36 million during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year due to increased customer discounts as a result of customer repricings partially offset by increased manufacturer cash discounts related to sales volume growth the decrease during fiscal 2008 was also partially offset by an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation 

clinical and medical products segment performance 

fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

during fiscal 2009 clinical and medical products revenue and segment profit declined compared to the prior year the declines were primarily driven by the deferral in hospital customers’ capital spending and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the enturia acquisition additionally segment profit was negatively impacted by product recalls and reserves and the alaris corrective action plan submitted to the fda and a hold on shipping certain infusion products the company expects the deferral in hospital capital spending referenced above to have an adverse impact on carefusion results through the middle of calendar year 2010 the hold on shipping certain infusion products referenced above was lifted in july 2009 

clinical and medical products segment revenue decreased 17 million or 0 during fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange 118 million and decreased volume to existing customers primarily as a result of the ship hold 65 million partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 171 million 

clinical and medical products segment profit decreased 65 million or 9 during fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year period in addition to the factors described above gross margin decreased segment profit by 58 million primarily as a result of the revenue decline the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange 77 million and an increase in raw material cost 50 million partly offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions 112 million in addition negatively impacting segment profit during fiscal 2009 were 21 million in charges for product recalls and reserves and the corrective action plan submitted to the fda product recalls and reserves were also 21 million for the fiscal 2008 sga expenses remained relatively flat compared to the prior year primarily due to cost control initiatives offset by the impact of acquisitions 60 million 

fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

clinical and medical products segment revenue increased 11 billion or 30 during fiscal 2008 primarily due to acquisitions 708 million revenue was also positively impacted by new products 97 million foreign exchange 91 million new customers 60 million and increased volume from existing customers 43 million 

clinical and medical products segment profit increased 200 million or 37 during fiscal 2008 gross margin increased segment profit by 508 million primarily due to acquisitions 321 million gross margin was also favorably impacted by a favorable mix of higher margin products combined impact of 109 million the impact of foreign exchange 48 million and the correction of a prior year error 11 million as described below the year over year impact of alaris product corrective actions and recalls negatively impacted gross margin in fiscal 2008 by 8 million increases in sga expenses negatively impacted segment profit by 308 million primarily due to acquisitions 246 million and to a lesser degree the impact of foreign exchange 21 million and increased investment in product quality and research and development costs 11 million 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the company discovered it had failed to recognize a portion of profit on sales pertaining to prior years the error resulted from system interface and reconciliation discrepancies over a period of several years as a result the company recorded income of approximately 11 million in fiscal 2008 of which 7 million pertained to fiscal 2007 and 4 million pertained to fiscal 2006 in connection with this matter the company implemented an action plan that has addressed the issues related to the error

all other segment revenue declined 172 million or 14 during fiscal 2009 all other segment profit decreased 5 million or 5 during fiscal 2009 a decline in gross margin decreased segment profit by 40 million and a decline in sga expenses increased segment profit by 35 million

debt ratingscovenants 

the company’s senior debt credit ratings from standard  poor’s rating services “sp” moody’s investors service “moody’s” and fitch ratings “fitch” are bbb baa3 and bbb respectively and the shortterm ratings are a2 p3 and f2 respectively the sp and fitch ratings outlooks are “stable” the moody’s outlook is “negative” the shortterm ratings downgrade by moody’s triggered by the spinoff may diminish the company’s ability to gain access to the commercial paper market but the company believes that it will be able to in such event utilize alternative sources of credit that are available to the company 

prior to the spinoff the company’s various borrowing facilities and longterm debt are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net worth which cannot fall below 50 billion at any time as of june 30 2009 the company was in compliance with this covenant

recent financial accounting standards 

see note 1 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company also provides financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 90 days to 10 years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation these financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company’s management 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks if the frequency or severity of customer defaults change due to changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts may require adjustment 

the allowance for doubtful accounts was 1397 million and 1357 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively this allowance represented 20 and 21 of customer receivables at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue was 014 015 and 015 at june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 566 million 253 million and 284 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively for customer deductions and writeoffs and was increased by additional provisions of 621 million 261 million and 240 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively a hypothetical 01 increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and salestype leases to the reserve at june 30 2009 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 70 million 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present 

the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2009 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time the company is not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

see schedule ii included in this form 10k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 

  

inventories 

a substantial portion of inventories approximately 71 and 70 at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively are stated at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within the company’s healthcare supply chain services segment “distribution facilities” and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals are primarily inflationary which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals are deflationary which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

under the lifo method it is assumed that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold as such the company uses lifo to better match current costs and revenue therefore reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting from declining branded pharmaceutical inventory levels generally will result in a decrease in future cost of products sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the inflationary environment conversely reductions in the overall inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical inventory levels would generally increase future cost of products sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a higher cost due to the deflationary environment the company believes that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation in fiscal 2009 and 2008 the company did not record any lifo reserve reductions 

the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout “fifo” method or market if the company had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 in fact primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories inventories at lifo were 349 million and 425 million higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively however the company’s policy is not to record inventories in excess of its current market value 

inventories recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 879 million and 931 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than the company’s assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which requires management to use significant judgment in determining fair value in addition current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles excluding goodwill the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 

in conjunction with the review of a transaction the status of the acquired company’s research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of iprd in connection with certain acquisitions the company is required to estimate the fair value of acquired iprd which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project management also assesses the current status of development nature and timing of efforts to complete such development uncertainties and other factors when 

  

estimating the fair value costs are not assigned to iprd unless future development is probable once the fair value is determined an asset is established and in accordance with fasb interpretation no 4 “applicability of fasb statement no 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method” is immediately writtenoff as a special item in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal 2009 the company did not record any charges related to the writeoff of iprd costs during fiscal 2008 the company reversed 250 million of a previously recorded writeoff of iprd costs associated with viasys as a result of the finalization of the viasys purchase price allocation process and recorded charges of 177 million and 253 million related to the writeoff of iprd costs associated with enturia and other minor acquisitions respectively during fiscal 2007 the company recorded charges of 839 million and 06 million related to the writeoff of iprd costs associated with the acquisitions of viasys and care fusion respectively see note 3 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” these statements provide guidance on the accounting and reporting for business combinations and minority interests in consolidated financial statements these statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 upon adoption in fiscal 2010 these statements are expected to have a significant impact on the company’s accounting and disclosure practices for future business combinations 

goodwill and other intangibles 

the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue to be amortized over their useful lives in conducting the impairment test the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment 

the company’s determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and if available a review of the priceearnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature scope and size of the applicable reporting unit the methods and assumptions used to test impairment have been revised for any segment realignments for the periods presented the discount rates used for impairment testing are based on the riskfree rate plus an adjustment for risk factors the ebitda multiples used for impairment testing are judgmentally selected based on factors such as the nature scope and size of the applicable reporting unit the use of alternative estimates peer groups or changes in the industry or adjusting the discount rate ebitda multiples or price earnings ratios used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to the company’s results of operations 

the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 which resulted in no impairment charges decreasing the priceearnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing by one point or increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing by 1 would not have indicated impairment for any of the company’s reporting units for fiscal 2009 or 2008 see note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles 

special items 

the company records restructuring charges acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items a restructuring activity is a program whereby the company fundamentally changes its 

  

operations such as closing facilities moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product restructuring activities may also involve substantial realignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” under sfas no 146 a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred 

acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies upon acquisition certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” and other integration charges are recorded as special items as incurred 

the company recognizes income from the favorable outcome of legal settlements judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters as special items on the consolidated financial statements when the associated cash or assets are received generally expenses due to the unfavorable outcome of legal settlements judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters “litigation settlement losses” are charged to the segment to which the matter relates and as a result are classified as sga expenses on the company’s consolidated financial statements in certain circumstances significant litigation settlement losses are classified in special items on the consolidated statements of earnings factors considered in determining whether a particular litigation settlement loss should be classified in special items include the size of the settlement the nature of the matter ie significant matters that are infrequent nonrecurring or unusual in nature are classified as special items the age of the matter and the pervasiveness of the matter to the entire organization the company also classifies legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previouslydisclosed sec investigation and related audit committee internal review and related matters as special items 

the majority of the special items related to acquisition integration and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employeerelated costs exit costs including lease termination costs asset impairments iprd costs and other integration costs employeerelated costs include severance and termination benefits lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility in addition other facility exit costs include certain costs related to the spinoff such as costs to evaluate and execute the transaction costs to start up certain stand alone functions and information technology systems and other onetime transaction related costs asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company’s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities iprd costs include the writeoff of research and development projects in process at the time of acquisition which had not yet reached technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan see note 3 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

vendor reserves 

the company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with its vendors in determining appropriate vendor reserves the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims the company has established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review the company researches and resolves various types of contested transactions based on discussions with vendors company policy and findings of research performed though the transaction types are relatively consistent the company has periodically refined its estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial impact to the company’s cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

vendor reserves were 563 million and 373 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively approximately 94 and 92 of the vendor reserve at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively pertained to the healthcare supply chain services segment fluctuations in the reserve balance are caused by the variations of 

  

outstanding claims from period to period timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies significant events would be described above in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” though vendor transactions remain relatively consistent from period to period unforeseen events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the reserve to fluctuate and thus have a financial impact on the period’s financial results 

at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company’s original estimate and may require adjustment the company believes however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

self insurance accruals 

the company is selfinsured for employee medical and dental insurance programs the company had recorded liabilities totaling 214 million and 207 million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported these estimates are based on the company’s assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month the impact on earnings would be 69 million if the amount of claims medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required the company believes however that the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances medical and dental insurance expense was 2439 million 1668 million and 1746 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary the company has certain deductibles or is selfinsured for various risks including general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation claims in excess of certain limits however are insured with commercial insurers the company had recorded liabilities totaling 796 million and 773 million for anticipated costs related to liability property and workers’ compensation at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures the company develops the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates although the company believes that liability estimates are appropriate based on information available at june 30 2009 it is possible based on generally accepted actuarial analysis that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of june 30 2009 by as much as 80 million the insurance expense for general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation was 528 million 511 million and 704 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the company 

  

had net deferred income tax assets of 622 million and 656 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively the company also had net deferred income tax liabilities of 18 billion and 17 billion at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively net deferred income tax assets included net federal state and local and international loss and credit carryforwards at june 30 2009 and 2008 of 193 million and 200 million respectively the company established a net valuation allowance of 152 million and 178 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relates to federal and state loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above the company anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the company adopted the provisions of fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this standard also provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement derecognizing classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition 

if any of the company’s assumptions or estimates were to change an increasedecrease in the company’s effective tax rate by 1 on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increasedecrease by 167 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

loss contingencies 

the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 5 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible loss an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates 

equitybased compensation 

the company accounts for equitybased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” applying the modified prospective method this statement requires all equitybased payments to employees including grants of options to be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 

the fair values of options granted after the company adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model and all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a blackscholes model the company’s estimate of an option’s fair value is dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events these estimates which are entered within the option valuation model include but are not limited to stock price volatility the expected option life expected dividend yield and 

  

option forfeiture rates effective with all options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 123r the company estimates its future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on the company’s common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant 7 years the company analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates the company calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors once employee stock option values are determined current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results sfas no 123r requires however the company to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary see note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding equitybased compensation

  cardinal health’s mission is to make the practice and delivery of healthcare safer and more productive for healthcare providers over the last fiscal year the company made three major changes to better pursue its mission 

 

  

first the company reorganized its reportable segments effective the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and began reporting its financial information within the following five reportable segments healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical healthcare supply chain services — medical clinical technologies and services pharmaceutical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing this change in segment reporting resulted from a realignment of the individual businesses to better correlate the operations of the company with the needs of its customers this change had no effect on the company’s reported net earnings or net earnings per common share 

 

second during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the company completed the sale of the pts business for approximately 32 billion in cash the company used the aftertax net proceeds of approximately 31 billion to repurchase its common shares the company recognized an aftertax book gain of approximately 11 billion from this transaction the assets and liabilities of the pts business were classified as held for sale in prior periods and its operating results were classified within discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 8 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on the company’s discontinued operations 

 

the company’s remaining four segments after the sale of the pts business align within two sectors the healthcare supply chain services sector which includes the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical and healthcare supply chain services — medical segments and the clinical and medical products sector which includes the clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing segments the healthcare supply chain services sector focuses on delivering bestinclass distribution and logistics services to its customers the sector generates 95 of total segment revenue approximately threequarters of total segment profit as defined below in the “segment results of operations” section and consistent and reliable cash flow the clinical and medical products sector focuses largely on developing innovative products for hospitals and other providers of care the sector with its higher margin products and services and faster growing segment profit has grown to contribute approximately onefourth of total segment profit

for further information regarding the company’s business see “item 1 — business” within this form 10k 

 

financial overview 

 

continued demand for the company’s products and services in fiscal 2007 led to revenue of 869 billion up 9 from fiscal 2006 operating earnings which were negatively impacted by special items 772 million decreased 26 to approximately 14 billion the significant increase in special items related to reserves for litigation settlements 655 million and inprocess research and development “iprd” expenses primarily in connection with the viasys acquisition 85 million the yearoveryear operating earnings comparison was 

  favorably impacted by increased gross margin 431 million partially offset by increases in selling general and administrative expenses 200 million net earnings which included the gain from the sale of the pts business 11 billion were 19 billion and net diluted earnings per common share were 477 

 

fiscal 2007 cash from operating activities decreased 898 million to 12 billion primarily due to the payment of litigation settlement reserves and government fines 690 million as discussed in the “special items” section below cash provided by investing activities was 15 billion due primarily to net proceeds from the pts business divesture 31 billion offset by cash paid for acquisitions 16 billion cash used in financing activities was 26 billion due to the company’s cash payments for treasury shares 37 billion offset by net proceeds from borrowings 631 million and issuance of shares 553 million 

 

during fiscal 2007 the company repurchased approximately 38 billion of its common shares under a 45 billion repurchase authorization of which 37 billion was settled prior to yearend on august 8 2007 the company announced a new 20 billion share repurchase program which expires on august 31 2009 see the table under “item 5 — market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for more information regarding the share repurchases also during fiscal 2007 the company paid 144 million in dividends or 036 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the board of directors raised the quarterly dividend by 33 to 012 per share the share repurchase activity apart from the use of net proceeds from the pts business divestiture and increased dividend payments support the company’s previously stated longterm goal to return 50 of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to shareholders and to increase its dividend payout to 20 of earnings per share

revenue 

 

revenue increased 72 billion or 9 during fiscal 2007 due to growth in each of the company’s four reportable segments including revenue growth of 65 billion within the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment due primarily to growth in revenue from bulk customers 40 billion the increase in revenue from bulk customers was due to certain existing customers deciding to purchase a greater volume of product from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer and to pharmaceutical price appreciation the company uses the internal metric “pharmaceutical price appreciation index” to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and consumer product price appreciation on revenue from the pharmaceutical supply chain business this metric is calculated using the change in the manufacturer’s published price at the beginning of the period as compared to the end of the period weighted by the units sold by the pharmaceutical supply chain business during the period the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 63 during fiscal 2007 the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment represents approximately 86 of total segment revenue refer to “segment results of operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting revenue in each of the company’s reportable segments 

 

revenue increased 70 billion or 10 during fiscal 2006 due to increased revenue within each of the company’s four reportable segments including revenue growth of 64 billion within the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment due primarily to growth in revenue from bulk customers 58 billion the increase in revenue from bulk customers was due to overall market growth and certain existing customers deciding to purchase a greater volume of product from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 56 during fiscal 2006 

 

cost of products sold 

 

cost of products sold increased 68 billion or 9 and 66 billion or 10 respectively for the fiscal years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 the increases in cost of products sold were mainly due to the respective 9 and 10 growth in revenue for fiscal 2007 and 2006 see the “gross margin” discussion below for further discussion of additional factors impacting cost of products sold 

 

gross margin 

 

gross margin increased 431 million or 9 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 over the prior fiscal year the increase in gross margin was primarily due to revenue growth of 72 billion factors favorably impacting gross margin included increased sales of clinical and medical products and related services 204 million increased manufacturer cash discounts 193 million generic pharmaceutical margin 192 million and distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of 171 million gross margin was negatively impacted by the increase in customer discounts within the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical and healthcare supply chain services — medical segments 324 million due to increased sales and competitive pricing pressures refer to the “segment results of operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting gross margin in each of the company’s reportable segments 

 

due to the competitive markets in which the company’s businesses operate the company expects competitive pricing pressures to continue however the company expects the margin impact of these pricing pressures will be mitigated through sales growth of higher margin manufactured products effective product sourcing realization of synergies through integration of acquired businesses and continued focus on cost controls 

 

gross margin increased 354 million or 8 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to revenue growth of 70 billion gross margin was favorably impacted by increased gross margin in clinical and manufactured products and related services 211 million and manufacturer cash discounts 139 million and distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of 134 million from the pharmaceutical supply chain business within the healthcare supply chain 

  services — pharmaceutical segment gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts 232 million in the pharmaceutical supply chain business 

 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses 

 

sga expenses increased 200 million or 7 during fiscal 2007 primarily in support of revenue growth additional items impacting sga expenses included increases due to acquisitions 72 million and the company’s charitable contribution to the cardinal health foundation 30 million sga expenses were favorably impacted by the yearoveryear reduction in equitybased compensation expense 70 million the reduction in equitybased compensation expense was due in part to changes made to the company’s equity compensation program and the grant of stock appreciation rights in the prior year refer to “segment results of operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting sga expenses in each of the company’s reportable segments 

 

the company expects sga expenses to grow in fiscal 2008 in support of sales growth and new product and service offerings and as a result of the impact of acquisitions and continued investment in research and development projects and international expansion however the company does expect to generate expense efficiencies through the integration of acquired companies and other cost controls 

 

sga expenses increased 385 million or 15 during fiscal 2006 primarily in support of the 70 billion revenue growth and as a result of increased equitybased compensation expense 199 million primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 123r see “other matters — adoption of sfas no 123r” below and note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding equitybased compensation additional items impacting sga expenses included increased incentive compensation expense 36 million due to improved operating performance incremental expenses associated with the company’s global restructuring program 38 million and increased legal expenses 15 million due to thenoutstanding litigation

provision for income taxes 

 

the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were 329 332 and 359 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and us state effective tax rates resulting from the company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the taxing jurisdiction the company’s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations outside the united states which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 35 the company has tax incentive agreements in several nonus tax jurisdictions which will expire in fiscal years 2009 through 2024 if not renewed the company does not believe that potential changes from existing tax incentive agreements will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

 

the company’s fiscal 2007 provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was 4126 million and the effective tax rate was 329 the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate benefited by 02 percentage points from equitybased compensation expense which is deductible at a tax rate higher than the average tax rate the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate was adversely impacted by 075 percentage points due to the nondeductibility of certain special items and impairments principally the iprd charge related to the viasys acquisition 

 

with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us federal or nonus income tax audits by tax authorities for fiscal years ending before june 30 2001 the years subsequent to fiscal 2000 contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount andor timing of income deductions and tax credits the internal revenue service “irs” currently has ongoing examinations of open years from 2001 through 2005 although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years while it is not currently possible to predict the impact of settlements or other irs 

  audit activity on income tax expense or cash flows during the next 12 months the company does not expect any significant impact on financial position 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the effective tax rate from continuing operations was favorably impacted by a 99 million adjustment to the tax reserves primarily due to the issuance of a final irs revenue agent report that related to fiscal years 2001 and 2002 during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 the effective tax rate from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a 73 million adjustment to the tax reserves related to an ongoing international tax audit during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 the company entered into an agreement with the irs to close the fiscal years 1996 through 2000 federal audits as a result the company reversed tax reserves of approximately 89 million 

 

the company’s fiscal 2006 provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was 5771 million and the effective tax rate was 332 the fiscal 2006 effective tax rate was adversely impacted by 02 percentage points due to the nondeductibility of certain special items 

 

a provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca” created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from nonus subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company determined that it would repatriate 500 million of accumulated nonus earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the ajca and accordingly the company recorded a related tax liability of 263 million as of june 30 2005 the 500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the company under the repatriation provisions of the ajca during fiscal 2006 the company repatriated 494 million of qualifying accumulated foreign earnings in accordance with its plan adopted during fiscal 2005 an additional tax liability of 04 million was recorded during fiscal 2006 due to new state legislation with respect to the ajca bringing the company’s total tax liability related to the repatriation recorded through june 30 2006 to 267 million uses of repatriated funds included domestic expenditures related to nonexecutive salaries capital asset investments and other permitted activities see note 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information

the company’s operations are organized into four reportable segments healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical healthcare supply chain services — medical clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing the company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon among other things segment profit segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold less segment sga expenses segment sga expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions including corporate management corporate finance financial shared services human resources information technology legal and legislative affairs and the integrated sales organization corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based upon headcount level of benefit provided and ratable allocation information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the segment level in addition special items impairment charges and other and investment spending are not allocated to the segments see note 17 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on the company’s reportable segments 

 

revenue increased in each of the company’s four reportable segments during fiscal 2007 including doubledigit growth in the medical products manufacturing 12 and clinical technologies and services 11 segments segment profit increased in each of the company’s four reportable segments including doubledigit 

  growth in the medical products manufacturing 20 clinical technologies and services 20 and healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical 14 segments

healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical performance 

 

during fiscal 2007 healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 65 billion or 9 primarily from revenue from bulk customers segment profit increased 157 million due to revenue growth increased generic pharmaceutical margin and increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation offset by increased customer discounts and increased sga expenses the pharmaceutical distribution market remains highly competitive and the company expects that customer discounts will continue to increase however the company expects that increased manufacturer cash discounts and distribution service agreement fees both of which increase with revenue growth combined with increased generic margin and continued pharmaceutical price appreciation will enable the company to offset increased customer discounts the company’s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases or pharmaceutical price appreciation decreases from its historical rate alternatively the company’s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases or pharmaceutical price appreciation exceeds its historical rate 

 

revenue from bulk customers described below increased 40 billion during fiscal 2007 with additional volume from existing customers 27 billion and new customers 13 billion revenue from nonbulk customers increased 25 billion growth in revenue from nonbulk customers was driven by additional sales volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation 40 billion the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 63 for fiscal 2007 acquisitions 12 billion mainly dohmen and parmed also had a favorable impact on the yearoveryear revenue comparison negatively impacting growth in revenue from nonbulk customers was the loss of existing customers due to competition 10 billion and the sale of a significant part of the specialty distribution business 17 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

  healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment profit increased 157 million or 14 in fiscal 2007 gross margin increased segment profit by 202 million primarily due to the segment’s revenue growth and increased generic pharmaceutical margin 192 million due to new product launches and competitive vendor pricing gross margin also was favorably impacted by increased manufacturer cash discounts due to sales volume growth 187 million and distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of 171 million gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts 319 million due to increased sales volume and competitive pressures the company expects continued customer discounting due to the competitive market in which it operates increases in segment sga expenses negatively impacted segment profit by approximately 45 million for fiscal 2007 increases in sga expenses were in support of the increased sales volume and due to the impact of acquisitions 37 million favorably impacting sga expenses was the reduction in equitybased compensation expense 14 million segment profit was negatively impacted by the prior year sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution business 43 million 

 

the company estimates that branded pharmaceuticals with industrywide sales volume domestically of 218 billion and 44 billion came off of patent protection during fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively which allowed for generic pharmaceutical competition the company’s estimate of industrywide branded pharmaceutical sales volume is internally developed using industry sales data for significant branded pharmaceuticals adapted for the company’s fiscal period generic pharmaceuticals negatively impact revenue because they are offered at lower prices than branded pharmaceuticals however generic pharmaceuticals positively impact gross margin and operating earnings due to competitive vendor pricing the company generally earns the highest margins on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product to the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary the company expects a similar level of branded pharmaceuticals will come off of patent protection during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

 

during fiscal 2006 healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 64 billion or 10 revenue from bulk customers increased 58 billion centralized warehouse and mail order customers contributed 50 billion and 08 billion respectively of the bulk customer revenue growth the additional sales volume was due in significant part to certain existing warehouse customers deciding to purchase from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer revenue from nonbulk customers increased 604 million based upon pharmaceutical price appreciation and additional sales volume from new and existing customers revenue growth was negatively impacted as a result of the decision of the specialty distribution business’s largest customer to begin self distribution on january 1 2006 and the sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution business in the fourth quarter 190 million the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 56 for fiscal 2006 

 

healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment profit decreased 81 million or 7 in fiscal 2006 gross margin increased segment profit by 70 million due primarily to the segment’s revenue growth and increased manufacturer cash discounts 139 million due to increased sales within the pharmaceutical supply chain business in addition gross margin was favorably impacted by distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of 134 million other factors favorably impacting gross margin included generic pharmaceuticals 32 million due to sales growth competitive vendor pricing the introduction of new generic pharmaceuticals within the pharmaceutical supply chain business the addition of new vendors to the segment’s national logistics center 27 million and a lastin firstout “lifo” reserve reduction 26 million primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories 

 

increased customer discounts within the pharmaceutical supply chain business negatively impacted segment profit by 232 million due to increased sales volume and competitive pressures segment profit was also negatively impacted by an adjustment 32 million as described in detail below increases in segment sga expenses negatively impacted segment profit by approximately 151 million for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 increases in these expenses were in support of the increased sales volume and increased equitybased compensation expense 67 million due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

as noted above healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment profit was negatively impacted by an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company discovered it had inadvertently and 

  erroneously failed to process credits owed to a vendor in prior years after a thorough review the company determined it had failed to process similar credits for a limited number of additional vendors these processing failures specific to a limited area of vendor credits resulted from system programming interface and data entry errors relating to these vendor credits which occurred over a period of years as a result the company recorded a charge 32 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting its estimate of the credits owed to these vendors 

 

bulk and nonbulk customers  the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk customers because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk customers bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses all other customers are classified as nonbulk customers for example retail stores pharmacies hospitals and alternate care sites bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as nonbulk customers for example a single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a nonbulk customer with respect to its retail stores bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and selfdistribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping nonbulk customers on the other hand require more complex servicing by the company these services all of which are performed by the company include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities warehousing the product for a longer period of time picking individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location 

 

the company tracks revenue by bulk and nonbulk customers in its financial systems to assist the company in managing its business an internal analysis has been prepared to allocate segment expenses total of segment cost of products sold and segment selling general and administrative expenses separately for bulk and nonbulk customers the following table shows the allocation of segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk customers for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions

the company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the selling general and administrative expenses for distribution between bulk and nonbulk customers as follows 

 

  

  

the internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers because of higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment sga expenses bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than nonbulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the company in 

  addition sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to nonbulk customers because bulk customers’ orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue due to the mix of products sold pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which in turn results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was onhand at the time of the manufacturer’s price increase since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to nonbulk customers there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation consequently segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for nonbulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the company than deliveries to nonbulk customers as such the segment sga expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from nonbulk customers these factors result in segment profit as a percentage of revenue being significantly lower for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers 

 

the company defines bulk customers based on the way in which the company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers the company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the annual reports on form 10k of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers the company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may or may not use a different definition of bulk customers 

 

during fiscal 2007 segment profit from bulk customers increased 35 million or 01 of revenue from bulk customers due to increased sales volume described above and the yearoveryear increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation segment profit for nonbulk customers increased 148 million or 02 of revenue from nonbulk customers compared to fiscal 2006 this increase in segment profit from nonbulk customers was due primarily to the increase in sales volume described above and the impact of generic products which had a greater impact on the profitability of nonbulk customers due to the mix of pharmaceuticals distributed to nonbulk customers 

 

fiscal 2006 segment profit from bulk customers increased 60 million or 01 of revenue from bulk customers due to increased sales volume described above and the yearoveryear impact of new distribution service agreements and pharmaceutical price appreciation the favorable impact of distribution service agreements and of pharmaceutical price appreciation had a greater impact on the profitability of bulk customers than on nonbulk customers in fiscal 2006 due to the mix of branded pharmaceuticals distributed to bulk customers these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in allocated equitybased compensation expense of 10 million due to the adoption of sfas no 123r the fiscal 2006 segment profit for nonbulk customers declined 136 million or 04 of revenue from nonbulk customers compared to fiscal 2005 an increase in segment profit from nonbulk customers due to increased sales and new distribution service agreements was offset by increased customer discounts an increase in segment sga expenses which was largely due to sales growth and an increase in allocated equitybased compensation expense of 57 million due to the adoption of sfas no 123r and a 32 million charge during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting credits owed to vendors 

 

healthcare supply chain services — medical performance 

 

during fiscal 2007 healthcare supply chain services — medical segment revenue increased 315 million while segment profit remained relatively flat the company remains focused on improving operating performance within this segment through continued investment in customer service and restructuring the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the company announced its plan to combine the headquarters of the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical and medical segments in order to promote sharing best practices and support functions to provide better service for its customers refer to “other matters — global restructuring program” below for further discussion of the company’s healthcare supply chain services — medical restructuring program 

 

healthcare supply chain services — medical segment revenue growth of 315 million or 4 during fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from increased volume from existing customers 215 million and new customer accounts 100 million healthcare supply chain services — medical segment profit increased 4 million or 1 during 

  fiscal 2007 gross margin increased segment profit by 27 million primarily as a result of revenue growth and the impact of increased manufacturer cash discounts 6 million negatively impacting gross margin were increased customer discounts 5 million and trade receivable reserves 7 million related to the segment’s customer service and shared service transition increases in sga expenses decreased segment profit by 23 million primarily in support of revenue growth and increased transportation costs 5 million favorably impacting sga expenses was the reduction in equitybased compensation expense 14 million

clinical technologies and services segment profit increased 65 million or 20 gross margin increased segment profit by 132 million primarily as a result of revenue growth gross margin was negatively impacted by the estimated costs of the alaris se pump corrective action plan and related consulting expenses 18 million due to the product recall increases in sga expenses decreased segment profit by 67 million in support of the revenue growth and as a result of the impact of acquisitions 22 million and increased investment in product quality and research and development costs 11 million favorably impacting sga expenses was the reduction in equitybased compensation expense 14 million 

 

during fiscal 2006 clinical technologies and services segment revenue growth of 241 million or 11 resulted primarily from revenue growth within the pyxis and alaris product lines pyxis products revenue increased 83 million due to higher unit sales resulting from increased demand for the medstation ® 3000 product and improvements within the sales and installation cycles alaris products revenue increased 125 million due to competitive displacements driven by technological advantages and sales obtained through the company’s other relationships these revenue increases were tempered by slower revenue growth in the clinical and consulting services 52 million 

 

clinical technologies and services segment profit increased 82 million or 35 during fiscal 2006 gross margin increased segment profit by 180 million primarily as a result of revenue growth factors favorably impacting gross margin included sales mix 49 million and manufacturing efficiencies 12 million driven by higher sales volume also favorably impacting the yearoveryear comparison were the inventory valuation adjustments to fair value from the alaris acquisition 24 million with the adjusted higher value inventory being sold during the first two quarters of fiscal 2005 increases in sga expenses decreased segment profit by 97 million due primarily to an increase in equitybased compensation expense 55 million due primarily to the adoption of sfas 123r and in support of the revenue growth estimated integration synergies from the alaris acquisition 54 million favorably impacted both gross margin and sga expenses 

 

medical products manufacturing performance 

 

during fiscal 2007 medical products manufacturing segment revenue grew 203 million or 12 revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased sales volume 74 million from existing customers and new customers won through new gpo contracts and competitor exits revenue growth was also favorably impacted by new product launches 50 million including innovations in gloves respiratory products surgical instruments and software and international revenue growth 62 million which includes the impact of foreign exchange 18 million acquisitions including denver biomedical and viasys favorably impacted the yearoveryear 

  comparison 37 million due to the acquisition of viasys the company expects significant growth in the medical products manufacturing segment 

 

medical products manufacturing segment profit increased 33 million or 20 during fiscal 2007 gross margin increased segment profit by 72 million primarily as a result of revenue growth factors favorably impacting gross margin included manufacturing cost reductions 20 million driven by strategic sourcing and expense control related to the company’s restructuring program and the integration of acquisitions 21 million primarily denver biomedical increases in sga expenses negatively impacted segment profit by 39 million primarily in support of the segment’s revenue growth and from the impact of acquisitions 13 million favorably impacting sga expenses was the reduction in equitybased compensation expense 12 million 

 

during fiscal 2006 medical products manufacturing segment revenue grew 96 million or 6 resulting from revenue growth from manufactured gloves and respiratory product lines 45 million due to new customer accounts 14 million and new products 31 million and international revenue growth 16 million from new customers

pharmaceutical supply chain business model transition 

 

historically a significant portion of the pharmaceutical supply chain business’ gross margin was derived from the company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory hold that inventory when a manufacturer increased prices and sell that product at the higher price beginning in fiscal 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and as a result began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers in addition manufacturers sought additional services from the company including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes significantly reduced the pharmaceutical price appreciation earned by the company 

  in response to these developments the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ pricing practices and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer’s products during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers this transition was completed during fiscal 2006 these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases 

 

under the feeforservice arrangements reflected in written distribution service agreements the company’s compensation for these services may be a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price appreciation in certain instances the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement the fee is typically a fixed percentage of either the company’s purchases from the manufacturer or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to its customers the company continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation slows the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a oneyear term with an automatic renewal feature to a fiveyear term these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed by the parties a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured or a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event occurs some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 

 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company also provides financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from ninety days to ten years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation these financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company’s management 

 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks if the frequency or severity of customer defaults change due to changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts may require adjustment 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts was 1289 million and 1264 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively this allowance represented 22 and 26 of customer receivables at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue was 015 016 and 016 at june 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 284 million 

  226 million and 212 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively for customer deductions and writeoffs and was increased by additional provisions of 240 million 246 million and 77 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively a hypothetical 01 increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and salestype leases to the reserve at june 30 2007 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 59 million 

 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2007 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time the company is not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

 

see schedule ii included in this form 10k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 

 

inventories 

 

a substantial portion of inventories approximately 73 and 75 at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively are stated at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core distribution facilities within the company’s healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment “core distribution facilities” and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo impact on the consolidated statement of earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals are primarily inflationary which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals are deflationary which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

 

under the lifo method it is assumed that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold as such the company uses lifo to better match current costs and revenue therefore reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting from declining branded pharmaceutical inventory levels generally will result in a decrease in future cost of products sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the inflationary environment conversely reductions in the overall inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical inventory levels would generally increase future cost of products sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a higher cost due to the deflationary environment the company believes that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the core distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation in fiscal 2007 the company did not record any lifo reserve reductions the lifo reserve reduction in fiscal 2006 of 260 million was primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories 

 

the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout “fifo” method or market if the company had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the core distribution facilities inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 in fact primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories inventories at lifo were 558 million and 10 million higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively however the company’s policy is not to record inventories in excess of its current market value 

 

inventories recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 958 million and 1122 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than the company’s assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

business combinations 

 

assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value in addition current and future amortization expense 

  for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles excluding goodwill the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 

 

in conjunction with the review of a transaction the status of the acquired company’s research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of iprd in connection with the acquisitions of viasys and care fusion the company was required to estimate the fair value of acquired iprd which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project management also assessed the current status of development nature and timing of efforts to complete such development uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value costs were not assigned to iprd unless future development was probable once the fair value was determined an asset was established and in accordance with fasb interpretation no 4 “applicability of fasb statement no 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method” was immediately writtenoff as a special item in the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company recorded 839 million and 06 million as a special item in fiscal 2007 representing an estimate of viasys’s and care fusion’s acquired iprd respectively see note 3 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

goodwill and other intangibles 

 

the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue to be amortized over their useful lives in conducting the impairment test the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment 

 

the company’s determination of fair value of the reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis or a review of the priceearnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature scope and size the methods and assumptions used to test impairment have been revised for the segment realignment for the periods presented the discount rate used for impairment testing is based on the riskfree rate plus an adjustment for risk factors the use of alternative estimates peer groups or changes in the industry or adjusting the discount rate used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to the company’s results of operations 

 

the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal 2007 and 2006 neither of which resulted in the recognition of any impairment charges decreasing the priceearnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing by one point or increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing by 1 would not have indicated impairment for any of the company’s reporting units for fiscal 2007 or 2006 see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles 

 

special items 

 

the company records restructuring charges acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items a restructuring activity is a program whereby the company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product restructuring activities may also involve substantial realignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” under this statement a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred 

 

acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies upon acquisition certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” and other integration charges are recorded as special items as incurred 

  certain litigation recorded in special items consists of settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent nonrecurring or unusual in nature the company also classified legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the sec investigation and the audit committee internal review and related matters as special items

vendor reserves 

 

the company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with its vendors in determining appropriate vendor reserves the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims the company has established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review the company researches and resolves various types of contested transactions based on discussions with vendors company policy and findings of research performed though the transaction types are relatively consistent the company has periodically refined its estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial impact to the company’s cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

 

vendor reserves were 726 million and 1124 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively approximately 61 and 73 of the vendor reserve at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively pertained to the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment fluctuations in the reserve balance are caused by the variations of outstanding claims from period to period timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies significant events would be described above in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” though vendor transactions remain relatively consistent from period to period unforeseen events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the reserve to fluctuate and thus have a financial impact on the period’s financial results 

 

at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company’s original estimate and may require adjustment however the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

 

self insurance accruals 

 

the company is selfinsured for employee medical and dental insurance programs the company had recorded liabilities totaling 243 million and 241 million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported these estimates are based on the company’s assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month the impact on earnings would be 60 million if the amount of claims medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required however the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

  medical and dental insurance expense was 1746 million 1405 million and 1404 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary the company has certain deductibles or is selfinsured for various risks including general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation however claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial insurers the company had recorded liabilities totaling 822 million and 763 million for anticipated costs related to liability property and workers’ compensation at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures the company uses third parties to assist in developing the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated by outside actuaries and are derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates although the company believes that liability estimates are appropriate based on information available at june 30 2007 it is possible based on generally accepted actuarial analysis that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of june 30 2007 by as much as 49 million the insurance expense for general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation was 704 million 713 million and 665 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the company’s income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 

 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards for tax purposes the company had net deferred income tax assets of 3942 million and 4611 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the company also had net deferred income tax liabilities of 17 billion at june 30 2007 and 2006 net deferred income tax assets included net federal state and local and international loss and credit carry forwards at june 30 2007 and 2006 of 1782 million and 849 million respectively the company established a net valuation allowance of 1805 million and 344 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relates to federal and state loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain the company established a 1271 million valuation allowance in fiscal 2007 related to capital loss carryforwards resulting from the pts business divestiture for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above the company anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

 

in addition the company has established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business the company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 

 

the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances a thorough research of the technical merits of the company’s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments in all cases the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities the company generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its conclusions amounts accrued for a particular period are adjusted when a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred 

  the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

 

in addition to income mix from geographical regions the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year although not material to the effective tax rate for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2007 if any of the company’s assumptions or estimates were to change an increasedecrease in the company’s effective tax rate by 1 on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increasedecrease by 125 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the company is required to adopt the provisions of fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this standard also provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement derecognizing classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the company is currently assessing the impact of fin no 48 on its consolidated financial statements 

 

loss contingencies 

 

the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 5 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 

 

equitybased compensation 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” applying the modified prospective method this statement requires all equitybased payments to employees including grants of options to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 

 

the fair values of options granted after the company adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model and all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a blackscholes model the company’s estimate of an option’s fair value is dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events these estimates which are entered within the option valuation model include but are not limited to stock price volatility the expected option life expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates effective with all options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 123r the company estimates its future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on the company’s common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant 7 years the company analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates the company calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors once employee stock option values are determined current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results however sfas no 123r requires the company to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary see note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding equitybased compensation

the term “distribution service agreement fees” refers to aggregate fees paid by manufacturers for services provided by the company related to the distribution of the manufacturers’ products the company’s feeforservice arrangements are reflected in written distribution service agreements and may be a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price appreciation as described below in certain instances the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement the fee is typically a fixed percentage of either the company’s purchases from the manufacturer or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to its customers 

 

the term “pharmaceutical price appreciation” refers to the impact on gross margin in dollars of pharmaceutical price appreciation for products sold during a particular period the impact happens when the company is able to purchase inventory hold that inventory when a manufacturer increases the price and sell that product at the higher price the company continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees if the frequency or rate of pharmaceutical price appreciation slows the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

the term “manufacturer rebates and incentives” refers to discounts the company receives from manufacturers as a result of competition among manufacturers including manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals in pricing their products manufacturer rebates and incentives are based on either the company’s purchases from the manufacturer or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to its customers the company may receive other incentives from manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals for an improved position of the manufacturers’ products in the company’s various generic formulary programs a formulary program is a generic pharmaceutical purchasing program that helps pharmacies maximize their cost savings with a broad selection of rebateeligible and lowerpriced generic pharmaceuticals the company generally earns the highest margins on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product in the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary 

 

in sum the company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business generates gross margin primarily to the extent that the selling price to its customers net of customer discounts exceeds in the aggregate cost of products sold net of manufacturer cash discounts distribution service agreement fees pharmaceutical price appreciation and manufacturer rebates and incentives 

with respect to its customers the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk customers because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by nonbulk customers bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses all other customers are classified as nonbulk customers for example retail stores pharmacies hospitals and alternate care sites bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as nonbulk customers

customers 

 

the company’s largest customers cvs corporation “cvs” and walgreen co “walgreens” accounted for approximately 21 and 19 respectively of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 the aggregate of the company’s five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 50 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 all of the company’s business with its five largest customers is included in its healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment the loss of one or more of these five customers could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

businesses in each of the company’s reportable segments have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members approximately 10 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation llc “novation” and premier purchasing partners lp “premier” the company’s two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue generally compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary as such the company believes the loss of any of the company’s agreements with a 

gpo would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the gpo although the loss of such an agreement could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition see note 1 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information regarding the company’s concentrations of credit risk and major customers 

 

suppliers

healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical 

 

historically a significant portion of pharmaceutical supply chain’s gross margin was derived from the company’s ability to purchase inventory hold that inventory when a manufacturer increased prices and sell that product at the higher price beginning in fiscal 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and as a result began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers in addition manufacturers sought additional services from the company including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes significantly reduced the pharmaceutical price appreciation earned by the company 

 

in response to these developments the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ pricing practices and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer’s products during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers this transition was completed during fiscal 2006 these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases 

 

the company’s feeforservice arrangements are reflected in written distribution service agreements distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a oneyear term with an automatic renewal feature to a fiveyear term these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed by the parties a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured or a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event occurs some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period see the “pharmaceutical supply chain business model” discussion under “reportable segments — healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical” above for more information regarding distribution service agreement fees 

 

healthcare supply chain services — medical

clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing 

 

the clinical technologies and services segment uses purchased components in the products it manufactures including customdesigned components and assemblies the medical products manufacturing segment uses a broad range of raw materials compounds and purchased components in the products it manufactures including latex and resins in certain circumstances the company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by raw material or component cost increases because the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity improvements in addition although most of these raw materials or components are generally available certain raw materials or components used by the company’s manufacturing businesses may be available only from a limited number of suppliers where there are a limited number of suppliers the company may experience shortages in supply and as a result the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

the company operates in markets that are highly competitive for example the company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business competes with two national wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors selfwarehousing chains direct selling manufacturers specialty distributors and thirdparty logistics companies in addition certain of the company’s customers have consolidated and may continue to do so in the future competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the company’s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

in recent years a significant portion of the company’s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers the company’s largest customers cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 21 and 19 respectively of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 the aggregate of the company’s five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 50 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 in addition cvs and walgreens accounted for 20 and 27 respectively of the company’s gross trade receivable balance at june 30 2007 as a result the company’s sales and credit concentration is significant any 

defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition

changes in the united states healthcare environment could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and the company expects the industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these changes such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information or the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the company’s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for the company’s products and services the company expects continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in the healthcare industry’s or any suppliers’ pricing reimbursement selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices or changes in the company’s customer mix could also significantly reduce the company’s revenue increase the company’s costs or otherwise significantly impact its results of operations 

 

healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic pharmaceuticals will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain pharmaceutical patents a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of or reimbursements for generic pharmaceuticals could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations including pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using electronic pedigrees regulations requiring pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act became effective on december 1 2006 these federal regulations have been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors a preliminary injunction was issued by the federal district court for the eastern district of new york that temporarily enjoined implementation of these federal regulations these laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” includes provisions that change the prescription drug reimbursement formula for generic pharmaceuticals under medicaid to a reimbursement formula based on the lowest average manufacturers’ price in an effort to reduce costs for that program the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” released a final rule implementing these provisions on july 6 2007 under the final rule the major changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to become effective in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2008 the final rule also requires for the first time public reporting by the manufacturers of the average manufacturers’ price as defined by cms for branded and generic pharmaceuticals the company is continuing to work with its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process the company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative changes if the company fails to successfully develop and implement such plans this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

the company’s healthcare supply chain services — medical segment at times purchases medicalsurgical and laboratory products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment’s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer if this practice becomes more widespread the ability of the healthcare supply chain services — medical segment to purchase products from other distributors as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors may be impaired this could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

the company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business is subject to appreciation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices which subjects the company to risks and uncertainties 

 

some distribution service agreements entered into by the company with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciationbased component to them in addition to a service fee component the company also continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation slows the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

revenue 

 

revenue increased 72 billion or 9 during fiscal 2007 due to growth in each of the company’s four reportable segments including revenue growth of 65 billion within the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment due primarily to growth in revenue from bulk customers 40 billion the increase in revenue from bulk customers was due to certain existing customers deciding to purchase a greater volume of product from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer and to pharmaceutical price appreciation the company uses the internal metric “pharmaceutical price appreciation index” to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and consumer product price appreciation on revenue from the pharmaceutical supply chain business this metric is calculated using the change in the manufacturer’s published price at the beginning of the period as compared to the end of the period weighted by the units sold by the pharmaceutical supply chain business during the period the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 63 during fiscal 2007 the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment represents approximately 86 of total segment revenue refer to “segment results of operations” below for further discussion of the specific factors affecting revenue in each of the company’s reportable segments

the company expects sga expenses to grow in fiscal 2008 in support of sales growth and new product and service offerings and as a result of the impact of acquisitions and continued investment in research and development projects and international expansion however the company does expect to generate expense efficiencies through the integration of acquired companies and other cost controls

provision for income taxes 

 

the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were 329 332 and 359 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and us state effective tax rates resulting from the company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the taxing jurisdiction the company’s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations outside the united states which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 35 the company has tax incentive agreements in several nonus tax jurisdictions which will expire in fiscal years 2009 through 2024 if not renewed the company does not believe that potential changes from existing tax incentive agreements will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

 

the company’s fiscal 2007 provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was 4126 million and the effective tax rate was 329 the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate benefited by 02 percentage points from equitybased compensation expense which is deductible at a tax rate higher than the average tax rate the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate was adversely impacted by 075 percentage points due to the nondeductibility of certain special items and impairments principally the iprd charge related to the viasys acquisition 

 

with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us federal or nonus income tax audits by tax authorities for fiscal years ending before june 30 2001 the years subsequent to fiscal 2000 contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount andor timing of income deductions and tax credits the internal revenue service “irs” currently has ongoing examinations of open years from 2001 through 2005 although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years while it is not currently possible to predict the impact of settlements or other irs 

audit activity on income tax expense or cash flows during the next 12 months the company does not expect any significant impact on financial position 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the effective tax rate from continuing operations was favorably impacted by a 99 million adjustment to the tax reserves primarily due to the issuance of a final irs revenue agent report that related to fiscal years 2001 and 2002 during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 the effective tax rate from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a 73 million adjustment to the tax reserves related to an ongoing international tax audit during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 the company entered into an agreement with the irs to close the fiscal years 1996 through 2000 federal audits as a result the company reversed tax reserves of approximately 89 million 

 

the company’s fiscal 2006 provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was 5771 million and the effective tax rate was 332 the fiscal 2006 effective tax rate was adversely impacted by 02 percentage points due to the nondeductibility of certain special items 

 

a provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca” created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from nonus subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company determined that it would repatriate 500 million of accumulated nonus earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the ajca and accordingly the company recorded a related tax liability of 263 million as of june 30 2005 the 500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the company under the repatriation provisions of the ajca during fiscal 2006 the company repatriated 494 million of qualifying accumulated foreign earnings in accordance with its plan adopted during fiscal 2005 an additional tax liability of 04 million was recorded during fiscal 2006 due to new state legislation with respect to the ajca bringing the company’s total tax liability related to the repatriation recorded through june 30 2006 to 267 million uses of repatriated funds included domestic expenditures related to nonexecutive salaries capital asset investments and other permitted activities see note 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information

reportable segments 

 

the company’s operations are organized into four reportable segments healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical healthcare supply chain services — medical clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing the company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon among other things segment profit segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold less segment sga expenses segment sga expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions including corporate management corporate finance financial shared services human resources information technology legal and legislative affairs and the integrated sales organization corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based upon headcount level of benefit provided and ratable allocation information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the segment level in addition special items impairment charges and other and investment spending are not allocated to the segments see note 17 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on the company’s reportable segments

healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical performance 

 

during fiscal 2007 healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 65 billion or 9 primarily from revenue from bulk customers segment profit increased 157 million due to revenue growth increased generic pharmaceutical margin and increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation offset by increased customer discounts and increased sga expenses the pharmaceutical distribution market remains highly competitive and the company expects that customer discounts will continue to increase however the company expects that increased manufacturer cash discounts and distribution service agreement fees both of which increase with revenue growth combined with increased generic margin and continued pharmaceutical price appreciation will enable the company to offset increased customer discounts the company’s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases or pharmaceutical price appreciation decreases from its historical rate alternatively the company’s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases or pharmaceutical price appreciation exceeds its historical rate 

 

revenue from bulk customers described below increased 40 billion during fiscal 2007 with additional volume from existing customers 27 billion and new customers 13 billion revenue from nonbulk customers increased 25 billion growth in revenue from nonbulk customers was driven by additional sales volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation 40 billion the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 63 for fiscal 2007 acquisitions 12 billion mainly dohmen and parmed also had a favorable impact on the yearoveryear revenue comparison negatively impacting growth in revenue from nonbulk customers was the loss of existing customers due to competition 10 billion and the sale of a significant part of the specialty distribution business 17 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment profit increased 157 million or 14 in fiscal 2007 gross margin increased segment profit by 202 million primarily due to the segment’s revenue growth and increased generic pharmaceutical margin 192 million due to new product launches and competitive vendor pricing gross margin also was favorably impacted by increased manufacturer cash discounts due to sales volume growth 187 million and distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of 171 million gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts 319 million due to increased sales volume and competitive pressures the company expects continued customer discounting due to the competitive market in which it operates increases in segment sga expenses negatively impacted segment profit by approximately 45 million for fiscal 2007 increases in sga expenses were in support of the increased sales volume and due to the impact of acquisitions 37 million favorably impacting sga expenses was the reduction in equitybased compensation expense 14 million segment profit was negatively impacted by the prior year sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution business 43 million 

 

the company estimates that branded pharmaceuticals with industrywide sales volume domestically of 218 billion and 44 billion came off of patent protection during fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively which allowed for generic pharmaceutical competition the company’s estimate of industrywide branded pharmaceutical sales volume is internally developed using industry sales data for significant branded pharmaceuticals adapted for the company’s fiscal period generic pharmaceuticals negatively impact revenue because they are offered at lower prices than branded pharmaceuticals however generic pharmaceuticals positively impact gross margin and operating earnings due to competitive vendor pricing the company generally earns the highest margins on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product to the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary the company expects a similar level of branded pharmaceuticals will come off of patent protection during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

 

during fiscal 2006 healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 64 billion or 10 revenue from bulk customers increased 58 billion centralized warehouse and mail order customers contributed 50 billion and 08 billion respectively of the bulk customer revenue growth the additional sales volume was due in significant part to certain existing warehouse customers deciding to purchase from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer revenue from nonbulk customers increased 604 million based upon pharmaceutical price appreciation and additional sales volume from new and existing customers revenue growth was negatively impacted as a result of the decision of the specialty distribution business’s largest customer to begin self distribution on january 1 2006 and the sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution business in the fourth quarter 190 million the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 56 for fiscal 2006 

 

healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment profit decreased 81 million or 7 in fiscal 2006 gross margin increased segment profit by 70 million due primarily to the segment’s revenue growth and increased manufacturer cash discounts 139 million due to increased sales within the pharmaceutical supply chain business in addition gross margin was favorably impacted by distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of 134 million other factors favorably impacting gross margin included generic pharmaceuticals 32 million due to sales growth competitive vendor pricing the introduction of new generic pharmaceuticals within the pharmaceutical supply chain business the addition of new vendors to the segment’s national logistics center 27 million and a lastin firstout “lifo” reserve reduction 26 million primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories 

 

increased customer discounts within the pharmaceutical supply chain business negatively impacted segment profit by 232 million due to increased sales volume and competitive pressures segment profit was also negatively impacted by an adjustment 32 million as described in detail below increases in segment sga expenses negatively impacted segment profit by approximately 151 million for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 increases in these expenses were in support of the increased sales volume and increased equitybased compensation expense 67 million due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

as noted above healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment profit was negatively impacted by an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company discovered it had inadvertently and 

erroneously failed to process credits owed to a vendor in prior years after a thorough review the company determined it had failed to process similar credits for a limited number of additional vendors these processing failures specific to a limited area of vendor credits resulted from system programming interface and data entry errors relating to these vendor credits which occurred over a period of years as a result the company recorded a charge 32 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting its estimate of the credits owed to these vendors 

 

bulk and nonbulk customers  the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk customers because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk customers bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses all other customers are classified as nonbulk customers for example retail stores pharmacies hospitals and alternate care sites bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as nonbulk customers for example a single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a nonbulk customer with respect to its retail stores bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and selfdistribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping nonbulk customers on the other hand require more complex servicing by the company these services all of which are performed by the company include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities warehousing the product for a longer period of time picking individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location 

 

the company tracks revenue by bulk and nonbulk customers in its financial systems to assist the company in managing its business an internal analysis has been prepared to allocate segment expenses total of segment cost of products sold and segment selling general and administrative expenses separately for bulk and nonbulk customers the following table shows the allocation of segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk customers for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions

the company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the selling general and administrative expenses for distribution between bulk and nonbulk customers as follows 

 

  

  

the internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers because of higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment sga expenses bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than nonbulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the company in 

addition sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to nonbulk customers because bulk customers’ orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue due to the mix of products sold pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which in turn results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was onhand at the time of the manufacturer’s price increase since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to nonbulk customers there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation consequently segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for nonbulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the company than deliveries to nonbulk customers as such the segment sga expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from nonbulk customers these factors result in segment profit as a percentage of revenue being significantly lower for bulk customers than for nonbulk customers 

 

the company defines bulk customers based on the way in which the company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers the company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the annual reports on form 10k of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers the company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may or may not use a different definition of bulk customers 

 

during fiscal 2007 segment profit from bulk customers increased 35 million or 01 of revenue from bulk customers due to increased sales volume described above and the yearoveryear increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation segment profit for nonbulk customers increased 148 million or 02 of revenue from nonbulk customers compared to fiscal 2006 this increase in segment profit from nonbulk customers was due primarily to the increase in sales volume described above and the impact of generic products which had a greater impact on the profitability of nonbulk customers due to the mix of pharmaceuticals distributed to nonbulk customers 

 

fiscal 2006 segment profit from bulk customers increased 60 million or 01 of revenue from bulk customers due to increased sales volume described above and the yearoveryear impact of new distribution service agreements and pharmaceutical price appreciation the favorable impact of distribution service agreements and of pharmaceutical price appreciation had a greater impact on the profitability of bulk customers than on nonbulk customers in fiscal 2006 due to the mix of branded pharmaceuticals distributed to bulk customers these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in allocated equitybased compensation expense of 10 million due to the adoption of sfas no 123r the fiscal 2006 segment profit for nonbulk customers declined 136 million or 04 of revenue from nonbulk customers compared to fiscal 2005 an increase in segment profit from nonbulk customers due to increased sales and new distribution service agreements was offset by increased customer discounts an increase in segment sga expenses which was largely due to sales growth and an increase in allocated equitybased compensation expense of 57 million due to the adoption of sfas no 123r and a 32 million charge during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting credits owed to vendors

pharmaceutical supply chain business model transition 

 

historically a significant portion of the pharmaceutical supply chain business’ gross margin was derived from the company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory hold that inventory when a manufacturer increased prices and sell that product at the higher price beginning in fiscal 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and as a result began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers in addition manufacturers sought additional services from the company including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes significantly reduced the pharmaceutical price appreciation earned by the company 

in response to these developments the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ pricing practices and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer’s products during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers this transition was completed during fiscal 2006 these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases 

 

under the feeforservice arrangements reflected in written distribution service agreements the company’s compensation for these services may be a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price appreciation in certain instances the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement the fee is typically a fixed percentage of either the company’s purchases from the manufacturer or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to its customers the company continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation slows the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a oneyear term with an automatic renewal feature to a fiveyear term these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed by the parties a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured or a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event occurs some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 

 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company also provides financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from ninety days to ten years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation these financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company’s management 

 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks if the frequency or severity of customer defaults change due to changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts may require adjustment 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts was 1289 million and 1264 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively this allowance represented 22 and 26 of customer receivables at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue was 015 016 and 016 at june 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 284 million 

226 million and 212 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively for customer deductions and writeoffs and was increased by additional provisions of 240 million 246 million and 77 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively a hypothetical 01 increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and salestype leases to the reserve at june 30 2007 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 59 million 

 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2007 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time the company is not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

 

see schedule ii included in this form 10k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 

 

inventories 

 

a substantial portion of inventories approximately 73 and 75 at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively are stated at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core distribution facilities within the company’s healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment “core distribution facilities” and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo impact on the consolidated statement of earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals are primarily inflationary which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals are deflationary which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

 

under the lifo method it is assumed that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold as such the company uses lifo to better match current costs and revenue therefore reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting from declining branded pharmaceutical inventory levels generally will result in a decrease in future cost of products sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the inflationary environment conversely reductions in the overall inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical inventory levels would generally increase future cost of products sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a higher cost due to the deflationary environment the company believes that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the core distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation in fiscal 2007 the company did not record any lifo reserve reductions the lifo reserve reduction in fiscal 2006 of 260 million was primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories 

 

the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout “fifo” method or market if the company had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the core distribution facilities inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 in fact primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories inventories at lifo were 558 million and 10 million higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively however the company’s policy is not to record inventories in excess of its current market value 

 

inventories recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 958 million and 1122 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than the company’s assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

business combinations 

 

assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value the company typically utilizes thirdparty valuation experts for this process in addition current and future amortization expense 

for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles excluding goodwill the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 

 

in conjunction with the review of a transaction the valuation experts assess the status of the acquired company’s research and development projects to determine the existence of iprd in connection with the acquisitions of viasys and care fusion the company was required to estimate the fair value of acquired iprd which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project management also assessed the current status of development nature and timing of efforts to complete such development uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value costs were not assigned to iprd unless future development was probable once the fair value was determined an asset was established and in accordance with fasb interpretation no 4 “applicability of fasb statement no 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method” was immediately writtenoff as a special item in the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company recorded 839 million and 06 million as a special item in fiscal 2007 representing an estimate of viasys’s and care fusion’s acquired iprd respectively see note 3 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

goodwill and other intangibles 

 

the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue to be amortized over their useful lives in conducting the impairment test the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment 

 

the company’s determination of fair value of the reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis or a review of the priceearnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature scope and size the methods and assumptions used to test impairment have been revised for the segment realignment for the periods presented the discount rate used for impairment testing is based on the riskfree rate plus an adjustment for risk factors the use of alternative estimates peer groups or changes in the industry or adjusting the discount rate used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to the company’s results of operations 

 

the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal 2007 and 2006 neither of which resulted in the recognition of any impairment charges decreasing the priceearnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing by one point or increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing by 1 would not have indicated impairment for any of the company’s reporting units for fiscal 2007 or 2006 see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles 

 

special items 

 

the company records restructuring charges acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items a restructuring activity is a program whereby the company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product restructuring activities may also involve substantial realignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” under this statement a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred 

 

acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies upon acquisition certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” and other integration charges are recorded as special items as incurred 

certain litigation recorded in special items consists of settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent nonrecurring or unusual in nature the company also classified legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the sec investigation and the audit committee internal review and related matters as special items 

 

the majority of the special items related to acquisition integration and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employeerelated costs exit costs including lease termination costs asset impairments and other integration costs employee costs include severance and termination benefits lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company’s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan see note 3 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

 

vendor reserves 

 

the company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with its vendors in determining appropriate vendor reserves the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims the company has established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review the company researches and resolves various types of contested transactions based on discussions with vendors company policy and findings of research performed though the transaction types are relatively consistent the company has periodically refined its estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial impact to the company’s cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

 

vendor reserves were 726 million and 1124 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively approximately 61 and 73 of the vendor reserve at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively pertained to the healthcare supply chain services — pharmaceutical segment fluctuations in the reserve balance are caused by the variations of outstanding claims from period to period timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies significant events would be described above in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” though vendor transactions remain relatively consistent from period to period unforeseen events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the reserve to fluctuate and thus have a financial impact on the period’s financial results 

 

at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company’s original estimate and may require adjustment however the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

 

self insurance accruals 

 

the company is selfinsured for employee medical and dental insurance programs the company had recorded liabilities totaling 243 million and 241 million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported these estimates are based on the company’s assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month the impact on earnings would be 60 million if the amount of claims medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required however the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

medical and dental insurance expense was 1746 million 1405 million and 1404 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary the company has certain deductibles or is selfinsured for various risks including general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation however claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial insurers the company had recorded liabilities totaling 822 million and 763 million for anticipated costs related to liability property and workers’ compensation at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures the company uses third parties to assist in developing the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated by outside actuaries and are derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates although the company believes that liability estimates are appropriate based on information available at june 30 2007 it is possible based on generally accepted actuarial analysis that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of june 30 2007 by as much as 49 million the insurance expense for general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation was 704 million 713 million and 665 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the company’s income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 

 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards for tax purposes the company had net deferred income tax assets of 3942 million and 4611 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the company also had net deferred income tax liabilities of 17 billion at june 30 2007 and 2006 net deferred income tax assets included net federal state and local and international loss and credit carry forwards at june 30 2007 and 2006 of 1782 million and 849 million respectively the company established a net valuation allowance of 1805 million and 344 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relates to federal and state loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain the company established a 1271 million valuation allowance in fiscal 2007 related to capital loss carryforwards resulting from the pts business divestiture for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above the company anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

 

in addition the company has established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business the company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 

 

the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances a thorough research of the technical merits of the company’s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments in all cases the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities the company generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its conclusions amounts accrued for a particular period are adjusted when a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred 

the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

 

in addition to income mix from geographical regions the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year although not material to the effective tax rate for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2007 if any of the company’s assumptions or estimates were to change an increasedecrease in the company’s effective tax rate by 1 on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increasedecrease by 125 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the company is required to adopt the provisions of fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this standard also provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement derecognizing classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the company is currently assessing the impact of fin no 48 on its consolidated financial statements 

 

loss contingencies 

 

the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 5 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 

 

equitybased compensation 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” applying the modified prospective method this statement requires all equitybased payments to employees including grants of options to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 

 

the fair values of options granted after the company adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model and all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a blackscholes model the company’s estimate of an option’s fair value is dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events these estimates which are entered within the option valuation model include but are not limited to stock price volatility the expected option life expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates effective with all options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 123r the company estimates its future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on the company’s common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant 7 years the company analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates the company calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors once employee stock option values are determined current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results however sfas no 123r requires the company to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary see note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding equitybased compensation

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  the company carried out an evaluation as required by rule 13a15e under the exchange act with the participation of the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2007 based on this evaluation the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2007 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and to provide that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate or be circumvented 

 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2007 in making this assessment management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso criteria” based on management’s assessment and the coso criteria management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2007 

 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report appears below under this item 9a and expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting  there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30 2007 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting 

 

implementation of new accounting software system  in july 2007 the company began processing selected financial transactions for its corporate functions and the clinical technologies and services segment on a newly implemented accounting software system this change of systems is designed to streamline and integrate the company’s financial close and reporting processes by reducing the number of platforms used to record and report financial information improving efficiency by reducing the amount of manual activity and improving the control environment by reducing variability in the financial policies processes and systems all fiscal 2007 accounting was performed on the company’s prior systems so this change had no impact on the company’s internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

the company will transition selected financial processes within its other segments to the new accounting software system throughout fiscal 2008 and 2009 as a result of the transition that has already occurred in the corporate functions and at the clinical technologies and services segment and the transition that will occur at other segments certain internal controls have changed or will change to support new financial processes 

 

limitations on control systems  the company’s management including its principal executive officer and the principal financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its 

internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected the company monitors its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and makes modifications as necessary the company’s intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and the internal controls will be maintained as dynamic systems that change including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant

customers 

the company’s largest customers cvs corporation “cvs” and walgreen co “walgreens” accounted for approximately 21 and 14 respectively of the company’s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal 2006 the aggregate of the company’s five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 46 of the company’s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal 2006 all of the company’s business with its five largest customers is included in its pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

businesses in each of the company’s reportable segments have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members approximately 15 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2006 was derived from gpo members through the 

  

contractual arrangements established with novation llc “novation” and premier purchasing partners lp “premier” the company’s two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue generally compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary as such the company believes the loss of any of the company’s agreements with a gpo would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the gpo although the loss of such an agreement could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition see note 12 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information regarding the company’s concentrations of credit risk and major customers 

suppliers 

pharmaceutical distribution and provider services 

the company obtains its products from many different suppliers the largest of which pfizer inc accounted for approximately 9 by dollar volume of the company’s revenue in fiscal 2006 the company’s five largest suppliers accounted on a combined basis for approximately 33 by dollar volume of the company’s revenue during fiscal 2006 overall the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are good the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable rates 

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business began a business model transition in fiscal 2003 regarding the manner in which it was compensated for the services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers historically pharmaceutical distribution was compensated by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of price inflation specifically a significant portion of the compensation pharmaceutical distribution received from such manufacturers was derived from the company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of price increases hold that inventory as manufacturers increased prices and generate a higher gross margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory 

beginning in fiscal 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and as a result began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers in addition manufacturers sought additional services from the company including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes significantly reduced the compensation as a percentage of revenue received by the company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 

in response to these developments the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ pricing practices and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer’s products during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers this transition was completed during fiscal 2006 these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases 

under the feeforservice arrangements reflected in written distribution service agreements the company’s compensation for these services may be a fee or a fee plus an inflationbased compensation component in certain instances the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement the fee is typically a fixed percentage of the company’s purchases or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to customers apart from its feeforservice arrangements reflected in distribution service agreements the company also continues to be compensated by some branded manufacturers based solely on price inflation if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

the distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a oneyear term with an automatic renewal feature to a fiveyear term these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed to by the parties a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured or in the event of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate without cause within a defined notice period 

medical products and services pharmaceutical technology and services and clinical technologies and services 

the medical products and services and pharmaceutical technologies and services segments use a broad range of raw materials compounds and purchased components in the products they manufacture including latex resins gelatin and pharmaceutical ingredients among others the clinical technologies and services segment uses purchased components in the products that it manufactures including customdesigned components and assemblies in certain circumstances the company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by cost increases because the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity improvements in addition although most of these raw materials or components are generally available certain raw materials or components used by the company’s manufacturing businesses may be available only from a limited number of suppliers there also may be cases where a particular raw material may be available from another supplier or several other suppliers but the company is constrained to use a particular supplier due to customer requirements regulatory filings or product approvals in either case where there are a limited number of suppliers the company may experience shortages in supply and as a result the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s medical products and services segment at times purchases medicalsurgical and laboratory products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment’s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer if this practice becomes more widespread the ability of the medical products and services segment to purchase products from other distributors as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors may be impaired this could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition

results of operations 

the following summarizes the company’s results of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

  growing demand for the company’s diversified products and services in fiscal 2006 led to record revenue of approximately 814 billion a 10 increase from fiscal 2005 the company’s operating earnings increased 8 to nearly 20 billion and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 14 to 290 the company placed significant emphasis on improving operating margins which increased in each reportable segment from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year 

reportable segments 

the company’s operations are organized into four reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services and clinical technologies and services see note 17 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal 2006 effective for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2007 the company will report financial information for the following five reportable segments supply chain services – pharmaceutical supply chain services – medical medical products manufacturing pharmaceutical technologies and services and clinical technologies and services 

pharmaceutical distribution and provider services performance 

during fiscal 2006 the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment revenue increased 11 primarily from revenue from bulk customers operating earnings within this segment were flat due to the positive impact of signed distribution service agreements and earnings from generic products offset by decreased selling margins resulting from competitive pressures and a charge of 318 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting credits owed to certain vendors during fiscal 2006 this segment completed its transition to a feeforservice business model as described below under “pharmaceutical distribution business model transition” with the transition to the feeforservice business model completed the segment’s operating earnings were more evenly distributed throughout the fiscal year moderating the historical earnings seasonality going forward this transition will continue to result in less earnings volatility within this segment 

  

medical products and services performance 

revenue and operating earnings within the medical products and services segment increased 2 and 4 respectively during fiscal 2006 however these growth rates were adversely impacted by the loss of the specialty distribution business’ largest customer at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 revenue and operating earnings growth rates were lowered by approximately 2 percentage points and 1 percentage point respectively during fiscal 2006 due to the loss of this customer and the ultimate sale of a significant portion of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the segment’s operating earnings growth resulted primarily from the favorable yearoveryear comparison from the prior year latex litigation charge favorable product mix and manufacturing cost reductions 

pharmaceutical technologies and services performance 

during fiscal 2006 the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment revenue increased 4 due to increased demand for certain proprietary and oral drug delivery formulations improved terms with existing customers and increased volume on certain sterile products and a significant onetime payment from an ongoing customer operating earnings decreased 3 within this segment due to the impact of competitive pressures and pricing within the nuclear pharmacy services business and the stronger us dollar during fiscal 2006 

clinical technologies and services performance 

during fiscal 2006 the clinical technologies and services segment revenue increased 11 due to increased demand for the segment’s core products within both the alaris and pyxis businesses and the introduction of new products in addition to the strong revenue growth noted above this segment’s operating earnings increased 56 due to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies and integration synergies from the acquisition of alaris 

pharmaceutical distribution business model transition 

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business began a business model transition in fiscal 2003 regarding the manner in which it was compensated for the services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers historically pharmaceutical distribution was compensated by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of price inflation specifically a significant portion of the compensation pharmaceutical distribution received from such manufacturers was derived from the company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of price increases hold that inventory as manufacturers increased prices and generate a higher gross margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory 

beginning in fiscal 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and as a result began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers in addition manufacturers sought additional services from the company including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes significantly reduced the compensation as a percentage of revenue received by the company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 

in response to these developments the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ pricing practices and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer’s products during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers this transition was completed during fiscal 2006 these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases 

  

under the feeforservice arrangements reflected in written distribution service agreements the company’s compensation for these services may be a fee or a fee plus an inflationbased compensation component in certain instances the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement the fee is typically a fixed percentage of the company’s purchases or the company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to customers apart from its feeforservice arrangements reflected in distribution service agreements the company also continues to be compensated by some branded manufacturers based solely on price inflation if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a oneyear term with an automatic renewal feature to a fiveyear term these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed to by the parties a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured or in the event of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate without cause within a defined notice period 

adoption of sfas no 123r and equitybased compensation expense 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” applying the modified prospective method sfas no 123r requires all equitybased payments to employees including grants of employee options to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r the company accounted for equitybased awards under the intrinsic value method which followed the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations and equitybased compensation was included as pro forma disclosure within the notes to the financial statements 

in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 123r the company did not modify the terms of any previouslygranted options the company made significant changes to its equity compensation program with its annual equity grant in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 including reducing the overall number of options granted and utilizing a mix of restricted share and option awards the company also moved from threeyear cliff vesting to installment vesting over four years for annual employee option awards and shortened the option term from ten to seven years 

total company operating earnings for fiscal 2006 were adversely affected by the impact of equitybased compensation due to the implementation of sfas no 123r and the impact of stock appreciation rights granted to the company’s then chairman and chief executive officer during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company recorded 2373 million for equitybased compensation during fiscal 2006 compared to 101 million in fiscal 2005 beyond the current fiscal year the company expects the equitybased compensation expense to decline yearoveryear due primarily to the significant changes made to the company’s equity compensation program including a reduction in the overall number of options granted see note 13 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

global restructuring program 

as previously reported during fiscal 2005 the company launched a global restructuring program in connection with its one cardinal health initiative with the goal of increasing the value the company provides its customers through better integration of existing businesses and improved efficiency from a more disciplined approach to procurement and resource allocation the company expects the program to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2008 and to improve operating earnings and position the company for future growth 

the global restructuring program is being implemented in two phases the first phase of the program which was announced in december 2004 focuses on business consolidations and process improvements including 

  

rationalizing the company’s facilities worldwide reducing the company’s global workforce and rationalizing and discontinuing overlapping and underperforming product lines the second phase of the program which was announced in august 2005 focuses on longer term integration activities that will enhance service to customers through improved integration across the company’s segments and continue to streamline internal operations see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for discussion of the restructuring costs incurred by the company during fiscal 2006 and 2005 related to both phases of the global restructuring program

results of operations 

the following sections discuss the results of operations of the company and its reportable segments 

revenue 

revenue for the company and its reportable segments are as follows 

 

        

the following table summarizes the revenue growth rates for the company and its reportable segments as well as the percent of company revenue excluding corporate each segment represents 

 

  total company total company revenue increased 10 and 15 respectively during fiscal 2006 and 2005 the revenue growth in fiscal 2006 resulted from the following 

 

  

  

  

 these increases were partially offset by slower revenue growth within the medical products and services segment due to the loss of the specialty distribution business’ largest customer at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and the ultimate sale of a significant portion of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 in addition the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment was adversely impacted by competitive pressures and pricing within the nuclear pharmacy services business 

the revenue growth in fiscal 2005 resulted from the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 these increases during fiscal 2005 were partially offset by slower revenue growth within the medical products and services and pharmaceutical technologies and services segments and a decline in revenue from pyxis products within the clinical technologies and services segment 

pharmaceutical distribution and provider services the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment’s revenue increased 11 during fiscal 2006 the most significant growth was in revenue from bulk customers described below which increased approximately 24 during fiscal 2006 in addition pharmaceutical price increases for the trailing twelve month period of approximately 56 contributed to the revenue growth in this segment 

  

the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment differentiates between bulk and nonbulk customers because bulk customers generate lower margins than nonbulk customers bulk customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses nonbulk customers include retail stores hospitals alternate care sites and other customers not specifically classified as bulk customers most deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and self distribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers nonbulk customers on the other hand require more complex servicing these services include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities warehousing the product for a longer period of time picking individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location 

bulk customers generate lower margins than nonbulk customers because of lower customer pricing and lower vendor margins both bulk and nonbulk customers generate vendor margins but such margins for bulk customers are lower due to the impact of product mix lower customer pricing and vendor margins for bulk customers however are partially offset by the lower cost of servicing bulk customers as noted above deliveries to bulk customers have lower servicing costs related to warehousing and handling than deliveries to nonbulk customers see the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment’s “operating earnings” discussion below for the significant items impacting margin within this segment 

revenue from bulk customers for fiscal 2006 was 299 billion compared to 241 billion in fiscal 2005 the increase in revenue from bulk customers primarily relates to additional volume from existing large retail chain customers and market growth with customers in the mail order business the increase from existing customers is primarily due to certain customers deciding to purchase from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer 

the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment’s revenue growth of 16 in fiscal 2005 resulted from strong sales to customers within this segment’s core pharmaceutical distribution business the most significant growth was in revenue from bulk customers which increased approximately 34 the increase in revenue from bulk customers primarily relates to additional volume from existing and new customers as well as market growth within the mail order business the increase from existing customers is primarily due to certain customers purchasing from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer in addition pharmaceutical price increases for the trailing twelve month period of approximately 49 contributed to the revenue growth in this segment however the rate of price increases was lower than the rate experienced over the prior fiscal year 

medical products and services the medical products and services segment’s revenue growth of 2 during fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the following 

 

  

  

 the specialty distribution business’ largest customer began self distribution on january 1 2006 which significantly impacted revenue growth during the second half of fiscal 2006 revenue growth was lowered by approximately 2 percentage points during fiscal 2006 within this segment primarily due to the loss of this customer during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the company completed the sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution business to oncology therapeutics network a wholly owned subsidiary of oncology holdings inc oncology therapeutics network a specialty pharmaceutical services company acquired the company’s oncology distribution capabilities and the company will maintain a minority ownership in oncology holdings inc in addition revenue growth was adversely impacted by foreign exchange rates due to the stronger us dollar 

  

the medical products and services revenue growth of 7 in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the segment’s revenue growth in fiscal 2005 was adversely affected by slower growth in the sale of selfmanufactured products and the loss of certain business from customers within a gpo 

pharmaceutical technologies and services the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment’s revenue growth of 4 during fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the following 

 

  

  

 the segment’s revenue growth was adversely affected by the competitive pressures and pricing within the nuclear pharmacy services business and the stronger us dollar adversely impacting revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point 

the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment’s revenue growth of 11 in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from strong demand for certain softgel products the impact of acquisitions primarily intercare and the acquisition of geodax within the nuclear pharmacy services business and the impact of foreign exchange rates revenue growth was offset by certain operational issues as noted below the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures within this segment accounted for approximately 5 of the revenue growth in fiscal 2005 revenue in fiscal 2005 increased by approximately 2 as a result of the impact of foreign exchange rates this impact takes into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the us dollar and the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment see footnote 6 to the table in note 17 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional discussion as it relates to fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment the segment’s growth was adversely affected by delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the company’s biotechnology and sterile life sciences business 

clinical technologies and services the clinical technologies and services segment’s revenue growth of 11 during fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from revenue growth within the pyxis and alaris products businesses pyxis products revenue increased approximately 15 due to higher unit sales resulting from increased demand for the medstation ® 3000 product and improvements within the sales and installation cycles alaris products revenue increased approximately 19 during fiscal 2006 due to competitive displacements driven by technological advantages and sales obtained through the company’s other relationships in addition alaris revenue increased due to the continued demand for its core products and the introduction of new products into the market these strong revenue increases were tempered by revenue growth of 5 during fiscal 2006 within the clinical services and consulting businesses 

  

the clinical technologies and services revenue growth of 41 in fiscal 2005 resulted from the impact of the acquisition of alaris alaris’ results of operations were not included in the prior period amounts strong revenue growth within the clinical services and consulting businesses was offset by significant revenue declines within the pyxis products business the pyxis products business experienced a revenue decline of approximately 17 in fiscal 2005 due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 operating earnings 

operating earnings for the company and its reportable segments are as follows 

 

         

the following table summarizes the operating earnings growth rates for the company and its reportable segments as well as the percent of company operating earnings excluding corporate each segment represents 

 

   total company total company operating earnings increased 8 during fiscal 2006 due to operating earnings growth in the clinical technologies and services and medical products and services segments and the favorable yearoveryear impact of special items and impairment charges and other which were partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses as discussed below see notes 2 and 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding special items and impairment charges and other 

total company operating earnings increased 8 during fiscal 2006 as a result of the following factors affecting the company’s reportable segments 

 

  

  

  

  

 total company selling general and administrative expenses increased 15 during fiscal 2006 due in part to the impact of equitybased compensation which represented 8 percentage points of the total increase the company recorded 2373 million for equitybased compensation during fiscal 2006 compared to 101 million in the comparable prior year periods see the “overview” section above and note 13 of “notes to consolidated 

  

financial statements” for additional information regarding equitybased compensation in addition operating earnings during fiscal 2006 were adversely impacted by the following 

 

  

  

 the company expects selling general and administrative expenses to grow at a slower rate in fiscal 2007 due in part to the significant changes made to the company’s equity compensation program resulting in reductions in equitybased compensation benefits received from the upfront investments related to the one cardinal health initiative and disciplined expense control 

total company operating earnings decreased 22 during fiscal 2005 as a result of declining operating earnings in each of the company’s reportable segments the company’s gross margins were dampened primarily by the following 

 

  

  

  

 total company operating earnings were also adversely affected by the unfavorable impact related to special items of 2180 million in fiscal 2005 these increased costs related to the company’s global restructuring program associated with its one cardinal health initiative the sec investigation and audit committee internal review and related matters and the integration of certain acquisitions which were partially offset by settlements received in antitrust and vitamin litigation see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

in addition the company recorded 1137 million for asset impairments during fiscal 2005 see note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information total company operating earnings for fiscal 2005 were impacted by the favorable impact of approximately 317 million from reductions in the lifo reserve primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical inventories total company operating earnings for fiscal 2005 were also impacted by the unfavorable impact of the following 

 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 pharmaceutical distribution and provider services the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment’s operating earnings were flat in fiscal 2006 operating earnings during fiscal 2006 include a lifo reserve reduction of approximately 260 million primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories operating earnings during fiscal 2006 benefited from the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 these benefits were offset by competitive pressures impacting selling margin the correction of an error as described in detail below and a reserve of 100 million related to excess inventory from a particular pharmaceutical manufacturer 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company discovered that it had inadvertently and erroneously failed to process credits owed to a vendor in prior years after a thorough review the company determined that it had failed to process similar credits for a limited number of additional vendors these processing failures specific to a limited area of vendor credits resulted from system programming interface and data entry errors relating to these vendor credits which occurred over a period of years as a result the company recorded a charge of 318 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting the credits owed to these vendors of this charge approximately 142 million related to fiscal 2005 approximately 113 million related to fiscal 2004 and approximately 63 million related to fiscal 2003 and prior in connection with this matter the company implemented an action plan that has addressed the issues related to the error 

the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services operating earnings decreased 5 during fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of reduced branded vendor margins resulting from changes in branded pharmaceutical manufacturers’ sales and pricing practices as discussed above in the “overview” section and competitive pricing pressures branded pharmaceutical manufacturers had changed their sales practices by restricting product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers in addition branded manufacturers’ product pricing practices were less predictable as the frequency of price increases slowed and the amounts decreased versus historical levels for fiscal 2005 pharmaceutical price increases for the trailing twelve month period were approximately 49 compared to 62 in fiscal 2004 

in addition operating earnings during fiscal 2005 were adversely impacted by approximately 147 million for inventory reserves related to a generic manufacturer’s bankruptcy approximately 100 million related to slow moving inventory reserves and approximately 78 million as a result of inventory rationalization of certain health and beauty care products the decrease in this segment’s operating earnings was partially offset by 317 million from reductions in the lifo reserve primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical inventories 

  

operating earnings were also impacted by improved margins from generic products and expense control within the pharmaceutical distribution business which resulted in lowering selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 

medical products and services the medical products and services segment’s operating earnings increased 4 during fiscal 2006 primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the medical products and services segment’s operating earnings were adversely impacted by increased selling general and administrative expenses allocated to the segment in addition the specialty distribution business’ largest customer began self distribution on january 1 2006 which impacted operating earnings growth during the second half of fiscal 2006 operating earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 1 percentage point during fiscal 2006 within this segment primarily due to the loss of this customer 

the medical products and services segment’s operating earnings decreased 6 during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 selling general and administrative expenses grew 11 during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the charge for latex litigation described above and higher personnel costs associated with the overall business growth these items were partially offset by revenue growth of 7 manufacturing efficiencies expense control related to the company’s global restructuring program and incremental operating earnings from new customers 

pharmaceutical technologies and services the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment’s operating earnings decreased 3 during fiscal 2006 primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment’s operating earnings decreased 25 during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below optimum capacity within the company’s biotechnology and sterile life sciences business operating earnings were also adversely impacted by approximately 80 million related to the write down of inventory within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business 

  

the operating earnings declines were partially offset by the strength of certain softgel and controlled release products and the yearoveryear impact of acquisitions of approximately 6 the impact of foreign exchange rates on operating earnings did not significantly affect the fiscal 2005 growth rates above this takes into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the us dollar and the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment see footnote 6 to the table in note 17 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment and the change made in fiscal 2005 

clinical technologies and services the clinical technologies and services segment’s operating earnings increased 56 during fiscal 2006 primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 charges of 236 million during fiscal 2005 related to purchase accounting adjustments from the alaris transaction also contributed to the favorable yearoveryear comparison the 236 million charge represented 14 percentage points of the fiscal 2006 operating earnings increase the purchase accounting adjustments during fiscal 2005 included an inventory valuation adjustment to “fair value” with the adjusted higher cost inventory being sold during the first two quarters 

the clinical technologies and services segment’s operating earnings decreased 24 during fiscal 2005 primarily from decreased operating earnings within the pyxis products business which was impacted by 

 

  

  

  

  

 the alaris acquisition improved operating earnings for this segment by approximately 23 for fiscal 2005 the results of operations from this acquisition are not included in the prior period amounts operating results from alaris while incremental to the segment’s results yearoveryear were adversely impacted by the effect of purchase accounting adjustments recorded during the first two quarters of fiscal 2005 these adjustments included the inventory valuation adjustment noted above which adversely affected gross margins by approximately 236 million

provision for income taxes 

the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting were 322 346 and 318 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within foreign and state effective tax rates resulting from the company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the taxing jurisdiction the company’s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations outside the united states which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 35 the company has tax incentive agreements in several nonus tax jurisdictions which will expire in fiscal years 2009 through 2024 if not renewed the company does not believe that potential changes from existing tax incentive agreements will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

the company’s fiscal 2006 provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was 5903 million and the effective tax rate was 322 the fiscal 2006 effective tax rate benefited by 03 percentage points from equitybased compensation expense which is deductible at a tax rate higher than the average tax rate the fiscal 2006 effective tax rate was adversely impacted by 01 percentage points due to the nondeductibility of certain special items 

the company’s fiscal 2005 provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was 5860 million and the effective tax rate was 346 the fiscal 2005 effective tax rate was adversely impacted by 16 percentage points due to expenses related to the repatriation under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “ajca” and 06 percentage points due to the nondeductibility of certain special items the tax rate during fiscal 2005 was not significantly impacted by equitybased compensation as the company implemented fas no 123r applying the modified prospective method in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

  

a provision of the ajca created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from nonus subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company determined that it would repatriate 500 million of accumulated nonus earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the ajca and the company recorded a related tax liability of 263 million as of june 30 2005 the 500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the company under the repatriation provisions of the ajca during fiscal 2006 the company repatriated 500 million of accumulated foreign earnings in accordance with its plan adopted during fiscal 2005 an additional tax liability of 04 million was recorded during fiscal 2006 due to new state legislation with respect to the ajca bringing the company’s tax liability related to the repatriation recorded through june 30 2006 to 267 million uses of repatriated funds include domestic expenditures related to nonexecutive salaries capital asset investments and other permitted activities see note 6 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company also provides financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from one to ten years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation these financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company’s management 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes general and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks if the frequency or severity of customer defaults changes due to changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions the company’s allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment 

the allowance for doubtful accounts was 1348 million and 1224 million at june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively this allowance represented 26 and 30 of customer receivables at june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue was 017 016 and 020 at june 30 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 248 million 225 million and 218 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively for customer deductions and writeoffs and was increaseddecreased by additional provisions of 287 million 87 million and 01 million in 

  

fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively a hypothetical 01 increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables to the fiscal 2006 reserve would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 52 million 

reserve methodologies are validated annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present the company believes that the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2006 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time the company is not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

the total company receivable balance greater than 60 days past due exceeded the total reserve balance by 24 million or 2 at june 30 2006 the total reserve at june 30 2005 exceeded the total company receivable balance greater than 60 days past due at that same date see schedule ii included in this form 10k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 

inventories 

a substantial portion of inventories approximately 73 in 2006 and 67 in 2005 are stated at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core distribution facilities and the national logistics center within the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo impact on the consolidated statement of earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price inflation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals and consumer products are primarily inflationary which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals are deflationary which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

under the lifo method it is assumed that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold as such the company uses lifo to better match costs and revenues therefore reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting from declining brand pharmaceutical and consumer product inventory levels generally will result in a decrease in future cost of goods sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the inflationary environment conversely reductions in the overall inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical inventory levels would generally increase future cost of goods sold as the remaining inventory will be held at a higher cost due to the deflationary environment in fiscal 2006 the lifo credit of 260 million was primarily due to price deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories the lifo credit in fiscal 2005 of 317 million was primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical inventories 

the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout “fifo” method or market if the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation for all inventory which approximates current replacement cost inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2006 and would have increased 260 million in 2005 due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories inventories at lifo are approximately 10 million higher than its fifo value as of june 30 2006 however the company’s policy is not to record inventories in excess of its current market value 

below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory 

 

   

inventories recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 1312 million and 1277 million respectively at june 30 2006 and june 30 2005 the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than the company’s assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and other intangibles 

the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist accordingly the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue to be amortized over their useful lives in conducting the impairment test the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment 

the company’s impairment analysis is based on a review of the priceearnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature scope and size or a discounted cash flow analysis the methods and assumptions used to test impairment have been consistently applied for the periods presented the discount rate used for impairment testing is based on the riskfree rate plus an adjustment for risk factors the use of alternative estimates peer groups or changes in the industry or adjusting the discount rate used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to the company’s results of operations 

the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal 2006 and 2005 neither of which resulted in the recognition of any impairment charges decreasing the priceearnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing by one point or increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing by 1 would not have indicated impairment for any of the company’s reporting units for fiscal 2006 or 2005 an increase in the priceearnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing or a decrease in the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis would not adversely affect the computed fair value of the reporting units see note 16 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill 

business combinations 

assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value the company typically utilizes thirdparty valuation experts for this process in addition current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles excluding goodwill the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 

in conjunction with the review of a transaction the valuation experts assess the status of the acquired company’s research and development projects to determine the existence of inprocess research and development “iprd” the company has not historically recorded significant costs related to iprd however in conjunction with the acquisition of alaris the company was required to estimate the fair value of acquired iprd which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project management also assessed the current status of development nature and timing of efforts to complete such development uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value costs were not assigned to iprd unless future development was probable once the fair value was determined an asset was established and as 

  

required by us gaap immediately writtenoff as a special item in the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company recorded 127 million as a special item in fiscal 2004 representing an estimate of alaris’ iprd see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

special items 

the company’s special items consist primarily of costs that relate to the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 100 “restructuring and impairment charges” certain costs related to these acquisitions such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs were recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by management certain other integration costs that did not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been implemented 

the costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” certain costs to be incurred by the company as the acquirer such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs are recognized at the date the integration plan is committed to and adopted by management certain other integration costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is implemented 

at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2003 the company implemented sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” to account for costs incurred in restructuring activities under this standard a liability for most types of exit costs is recognized as incurred as discussed above the company previously accounted for costs associated with restructuring activities under eitf issue no 943 which required the company to recognize a liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan 

the majority of the special items related to acquisitions and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employeerelated costs exit costs including lease termination costs asset impairments and other integration costs employee costs include severance and termination benefits lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company’s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 

the company also records settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent nonrecurring or unusual in nature as special items in addition costs related to legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the sec investigation and the audit committee internal review and related matters are also classified as special items see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

vendor reserves 

the company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with its vendors in determining appropriate vendor reserves the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims the company has established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review the company researches and resolves various types of contested transactions based on discussions with vendors company policy and 

  

findings of research performed though the transaction types are relatively consistent the company has periodically refined its estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial impact to the company’s cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 

at june 30 2006 and june 30 2005 vendor reserves were 993 million and 1031 million respectively approximately 69 of the vendor reserve at june 30 2006 and june 30 2005 pertained to the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment fluctuations in the reserve balance are also caused by the variations of outstanding claims from period to period timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies significant events would be described above in the operating earnings discussion of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” though vendor transactions remain relatively consistent from period to period unforeseen events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the reserve to fluctuate and thus have a financial impact on the period’s financial results 

at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company’s original estimate and may require adjustment however the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

equitybased compensation 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r applying the modified prospective method this statement requires all equitybased payments to employees including grants of options to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 

the fair values of options granted after the company adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model and all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a blackscholes model the company’s estimate of an option’s fair value is dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events these estimates which are entered within the option valuation model include but are not limited to stock price volatility the expected option life expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates effective with all options granted during fiscal 2006 the company estimates its future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on the company’s common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant 7 years the company analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates the company calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors once employee stock option values are determined current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results however sfas no 123r requires the company to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary see note 13 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding equitybased compensation 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes the company had net deferred income tax assets of 4611 million and 3004 million at june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively the company also had net deferred income tax liabilities of 16791 million and 15363 million at june 30 

  

2006 and 2005 respectively included in the net deferred income tax assets are net federal state and local and international loss and credit carryforwards at june 30 2006 and 2005 of 849 million and 826 million respectively the company has established a net valuation allowance of 344 million at june 30 2006 against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relates to state and international loss and credit carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above the company anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

in addition the company has established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business the company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 

the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances a thorough research of the technical merits of the company’s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments in all cases the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities the company generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its conclusions amounts accrued for a particular period are adjusted when a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred 

the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

in addition to income mix from geographical regions the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year although not material to the effective tax rate for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2006 if any of the company’s assumptions or estimates were to change an increasedecrease in the company’s effective tax rate by 1 on earnings before income taxes discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting would have caused income tax expense to increasedecrease by 184 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 

loss contingencies 

the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 5 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 

self insurance accruals 

the company is selfinsured for employee medical and dental insurance programs the company had recorded liabilities totaling 241 million and 260 million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending 

  

claims administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported these estimates are based on the company’s assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month the impact on earnings would be 55 million if the amount of claims medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required however the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances medical and dental insurance expense was 1648 million 1625 million and 1408 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary the company has certain deductibles or is selfinsured for various risks including general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation however claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial insurers the company had recorded liabilities totaling 763 million and 664 million for anticipated costs related to liability property and workers’ compensation at june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported for certain types of exposures the company uses third parties to assist in developing the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated by outside actuaries and are derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates although the company believes that liability estimates are appropriate based on information available at june 30 2006 it is possible based on generally accepted actuarial analysis that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of june 30 2006 by as much as 42 million the insurance expense for general liability product liability pharmacist professional liability auto liability property and workers’ compensation was 779 million 750 million and 598 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively

the company’s transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent or its subsidiaries as part of its risk management program at the end of each fiscal year the company performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year the 2006 analysis utilizes an implied volatility measurement for each currency to estimate the net potential gain or loss the 2005 analysis assumed a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening of the us dollar included in the analysis is the estimated impact of its hedging program which mitigates the company’s transactional exposure at june 30 2006 and 2005 the company had hedged approximately 44 and 52 respectively of its transactional exposures the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to the company’s transactional exposure 

 

 translational exposure 

the company also has exposure related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign divisions into us dollars the functional currency of the parent it performs a similar analysis as described above related to this translational exposure the company does not typically hedge any of its translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in the company’s analysis at june 30 2006 and 2005 the following table summarizes the company’s translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the us dollar 

 

 interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of the company’s longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors the company’s policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management the company utilizes interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate movements 

as part of its risk management program the company annually performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates at june 30 2006 and 2005 the potential increase or decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 62 million and 46 million respectively 

commodity price sensitivity the company purchases certain commodities for use in its manufacturing processes which include latex heating oil diesel fuel and polystyrene among others the company typically purchases these commodities at market prices and as a result is affected by price fluctuations as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analysis on its forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year at june 30 2006 and 2005 the company had not hedged any of these exposures the table 

  

below summarizes the company’s analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices as of june 30 2006 and 2005 

 

 the company also has exposure to certain energy related commodities including natural gas and electricity through its normal course of business these exposures result primarily from operating the company’s distribution manufacturing and corporate facilities in certain deregulated markets the company from time to time enters into longterm purchase contracts to supply these items at a specific price

as disclosed in note 9 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” prior to filing the 2004 form 10k the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements as a result of the internal review undertaken by the audit committee with respect to certain accounting matters specifically the company restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000 2001 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 reclassified certain categories of revenue reduced its fourth quarter fiscal 2004 results for premature revenue recognition in its former automation and information services segment and expanded disclosure the reclassification and restatement adjustments were reflected in the 2004 form 10k 

in connection with the audit committee’s internal review since the end of fiscal 2004 the company has adopted and substantially implemented various measures in connection with the company’s ongoing efforts to improve its internal control processes and corporate governance for additional information regarding these measures refer to item 9a of the company’s 2005 form 10k the company will continue to develop policies and procedures and reinforce compliance with existing policies and procedures in the company’s effort to constantly improve its internal control environment 

the company believes that the implementation of the enhancements resulting from the audit committee’s internal review as well as other control and governance enhancements have remediated the “material weaknesses” as defined under standards established by the public company accounting oversight board in the company’s entity level controls relating to the company’s control environment through june 30 2004 and with respect to the timing of revenue recognition within the company’s former automation and information services segment which material weaknesses were identified and communicated to the company by its independent auditors prior to the filing of the 2004 form 10k 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the company carried out an evaluation as required by rule 13a15e under the exchange act with the participation of the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2006 based on this evaluation the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2006 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 in making this assessment management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso criteria” based on management’s assessment and the coso criteria management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report appears below under this item 9a and expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting 

significant deficiencies as noted above management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 did not result in the identification of any material weaknesses however the company identified a limited number of “significant deficiencies” as defined under standards established by the public company accounting oversight board as of june 30 2006 that do not in the aggregate rise to the level of a material weakness the company has developed specific action plans to address each of these significant deficiencies 

limitations on control systems  the company’s management including its principal executive officer and the principal financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected the company monitors its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and makes modifications as necessary the company’s intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and the internal controls will be maintained as dynamic systems that change including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant notwithstanding the foregoing and as discussed above under this item 9a the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2006 in addition also as discussed above the company’s management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006

the shareholders and the 

board of directors of cardinal health inc

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 based on the coso criteria

as previously reported in october 2003 the sec initiated an informal inquiry regarding the company the sec’s initial request sought historical financial and related information including but not limited to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers in connection with the sec’s informal inquiry the audit committee of the board of directors of the company commenced its own internal review in april 2004 assisted by independent counsel on may 6 2004 the company was notified that the sec had converted the informal inquiry into a formal investigation on june 21 2004 as part of the sec’s formal investigation the company received an additional sec subpoena that included a request for the production of documents relating to revenue classification and the methods used for such classification in the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business as either “operating revenue” or “bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other” in addition the company learned that the us attorney for the southern district of new york had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the company that the company understands relates to the revenue classification issue on october 12 2004 in connection with the sec’s formal investigation the company received a subpoena from the sec requesting the production of documents relating to compensation information for specific current and former employees and officers the company was notified in april 2005 that certain current and former employees and directors received subpoenas from the sec requesting the production of documents the subject matter of these requests is consistent with the subject matter of the subpoenas the company had previously received from the sec the company continues to respond to the sec’s investigation and the audit committee’s internal review and provide all information required 

during september and october 2004 the audit committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review these conclusions regarding certain items that impact revenue and earnings related to four primary areas of focus 1 classification of sales to customer warehouses between “operating revenue” and “bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other” within the company’s pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment 2 disclosure of the company’s practice in certain reporting periods of accelerating its receipt and recognition of cash discounts earned from suppliers for prompt payment 3 timing of revenue recognition within the company’s former automation and information services segment and 4 certain balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments that had been identified in the internal review these conclusions were detailed in notes 1 and 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in the 2004 form 10k 

in connection with the audit committee’s conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements which were reflected in the 2004 form 10k revenue previously disclosed separately as “bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and others” was aggregated with “operating revenue” resulting in combined “revenue” being reported in the financial statements in addition the company changed its accounting method for recognizing income from cash discounts the company also reduced its fourth quarter fiscal 2004 results of operations for premature revenue recognition within its former automation and information services segment after assessing the impact this segment’s sales practice had on the company’s results of operations for the three year period ended june 30 2004 lastly the company restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000 2001 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 as a result of various misapplications of generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and errors relating primarily to balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments recorded in prior periods as a result the company supplemented its historical disclosures within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2004 form 10k to reflect these reclassification and restatement adjustments on previously reported company and business segment operating earnings performance all prior period disclosures presented in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2004 form 10k were adjusted to reflect these changes more information with respect to the prior conclusions of the audit committee’s internal review and the impact of the reclassification and restatement adjustments on the reporting periods discussed in this form 10k is set forth in notes 1 and 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

following the conclusions reached by the audit committee in september and october 2004 the audit committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were reflected in the 2004 form 10k and in january 2005 took disciplinary actions with respect to the company’s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these matters other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for which there is a separate board committee internal review discussed below the disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand these disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial personnel as well as other personnel at the corporate level and in the four business segments none of the company’s current corporate executive officers who are identified under the heading “executive officers of the company” following item 4 of this form 10k were the subject of disciplinary action by the audit committee in connection with the determinations made by the audit committee the company’s former controller resigned effective february 15 2005 the audit committee has completed its determinations of responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were reflected in the 2004 form 10k although responsibility for matters relating to the company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers has been addressed by a separate committee of the board the audit committee internal review is substantially complete 

in connection with the sec’s formal investigation a committee of the board of directors with the assistance of independent counsel separately initiated an internal review to assign responsibility for matters relating to the company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers in the 2004 form 10k as part of the audit committee’s internal review the company reversed its previous recognition of estimated recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and recognized the income from such recoveries as a special item in the period in which cash was received from the manufacturers the sec staff had previously advised the company that in its view the company did not have an appropriate basis for recognizing the income in advance of receiving the cash in august 2005 the separate board committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review and determined that no additional disciplinary actions were required beyond the disciplinary actions already taken by the audit committee as described above the separate board committee internal review is substantially complete 

settlement discussions have recently commenced with the sec regarding resolution of its investigation with respect to the company while these discussions are ongoing there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the company will be successful and the company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the terms of any such resolution as a result of the initiation of these discussions the company recorded a reserve of 25 million for its fiscal year ended june 30 2005 in respect of the sec investigation unless and until the sec investigation is resolved there can be no assurance that the amount reserved by the company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a 

larger amount will not be required therefore this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted to the extent that the company determines it is necessary 

the sec investigation the us attorney inquiry the audit committee internal review and the separate board committee internal review remain ongoing although the audit committee internal review and the separate board committee internal review are substantially complete while the company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information required the company cannot predict the outcome of the sec investigation the us attorney inquiry the audit committee internal review or the separate board committee internal review the outcome of the sec investigation the us attorney inquiry and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the company andor current or former company employees officers andor directors as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties remedies and sanctions 

in addition there can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required that the historical consolidated financial statements included in the 2004 form 10k the forms 10q for the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005 or this form 10k will not change or require amendment or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances as the sec’s investigation the us attorney’s inquiry and the audit committee’s internal review continue the audit committee may identify new issues or make additional findings if it receives additional information that may have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and the scope of the restatements described in the 2004 form 10k the forms 10q for the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005 and this form 10k 

in connection with the audit committee’s internal review since the end of fiscal 2004 the company has adopted and is in the process of implementing various measures in connection with the company’s ongoing efforts to improve its internal control processes and corporate governance these measures include the following

customers and suppliers 

the company’s largest customers cvs corporation “cvs” and walgreen co “walgreens” accounted for approximately 21 and 10 respectively of the company’s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal 2005 all of the company’s business with cvs and walgreens is included in its pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment the aggregate of the company’s five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 37 of the company’s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal 2005 the company could be adversely affected if the business of these customers was lost 

in addition certain of the company’s businesses have entered into agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” that act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members approximately 15 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2005 was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation llc “novation” and premier purchasing partners lp “premier” the company’s two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue generally compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary as such the company believes the loss of any of the company’s agreements with a gpo would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the gpo although the loss of such an agreement could adversely affect the company’s operating results see note 13 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information regarding the company’s concentrations of credit risk and major customers 

the company obtains its products from many different suppliers the largest of which pfizer inc accounted for approximately 13 by dollar volume of the company’s revenue in fiscal 2005 the company’s five largest suppliers combined accounted for approximately 42 by dollar volume of the company’s revenue during fiscal 2005 overall the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are good new distribution service agreements recently entered into between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a oneyear term with an automatic renewal feature to a fiveyear term such agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed to by the parties a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured or in the event of an involuntary bankruptcy filing the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect the company’s business if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable rates 

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business is in a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for the logistical capital and administrative services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers historically the compensation received by the pharmaceutical distribution business from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each manufacturer’s unique sales practices eg volume of product available for sale eligibility to purchase product cash discounts for prompt payment rebates etc and pharmaceutical pricing practices eg the timing frequency and magnitude of product price increases specifically a significant portion of the compensation the pharmaceutical distribution business received from manufacturers was derived from the company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of pharmaceutical price increases hold that inventory as manufacturers increased pharmaceutical prices and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory this compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of each branded pharmaceutical manufacturer including established policies concerning the volume of product available for purchase in advance of a price increase and on predictable pharmaceutical pricing practices 

beginning in fiscal 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain and as a result began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers in addition manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from the company including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns the company believes that the manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes have significantly reduced the compensation received by the company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers as a result of these actions by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers the company concluded it was no longer being adequately and consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical capital and administrative services being provided by the company to these manufacturers 

in response to the developments discussed above the company has established a compensation system that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ sales or pricing practices and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer’s products during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that adequately compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers the initial feeforservice transition is essentially complete which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment 

as part of the transition to feeforservice terms certain of the new distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with certain other branded manufacturers still continue to be solely inflationbased if branded pharmaceutical price inflation is lower than the 

company has anticipated its operating results could be adversely affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent feebased compensation in its pharmaceutical distribution business in addition certain key distribution service agreements will be renegotiated in the latter half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire if the terms of the renegotiated agreements are unfavorable to the company it could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s manufacturing businesses within the medical products and services and pharmaceutical technologies and services segments use a broad range of raw materials in the products that they produce these raw materials include for medical products and services latex resin and fuel oil and for pharmaceutical technologies and services resin gelatin and active pharmaceutical ingredients among others in certain circumstances the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by increases in raw materials costs because the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity improvements in addition although most of these raw materials are generally available certain raw materials used by the company’s manufacturing businesses may be available only from a limited number of suppliers there also may be cases where a particular raw material may be available from another supplier or several other suppliers but the company is constrained to use a particular supplier due to customer requirements regulatory filings or product approvals in either case where there are a limited number of suppliers the company may experience shortages in supply and as a result the company’s operating results could be adversely affected 

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business utilizes contract carriers to distribute its products contracts with these carriers generally contain a fuel surcharge capped at a certain percentage if fuel costs rise significantly the pharmaceutical distribution business may need to increase the specified fuel surcharge which is limited to specified annual percentage increases with certain contract carriers in the event that the pharmaceutical distribution business cannot reach agreement on these changes it may need to replace the contract carriers at prevailing market rates the company’s medical products and services distribution and nuclear pharmacy services businesses own their distribution fleets which distribute a majority of their products to customers these businesses are directly impacted by market changes in the price of fuel as a result of the company’s exposure to fuel costs the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by increased fuel costs as the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from its customers 

the company’s medical products and services distribution business purchases medicalsurgical products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of such business to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer if this practice becomes more widespread the ability of the medical products and services distribution business to purchase products from other distributors as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors may be impaired this could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

while certain of the company’s operations may show quarterly fluctuations the company does not consider its business to be seasonal in nature on a consolidated basis 

competition 

the markets in which the company operates generally are highly competitive 

in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment the company’s pharmaceutical wholesale distribution business competes directly with two other national wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors direct selling manufacturers selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors and thirdparty logistics companies on the basis of a value proposition that includes breadth of product lines service offerings support services and pricing the company’s pharmaceutical wholesale distribution operations have narrow profit margins and accordingly the company’s earnings depend significantly on its ability to distribute a large volume and variety of products efficiently to provide quality support services to compete effectively on the pricing of pharmaceutical products and to maintain satisfactory arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers whereby the company is compensated for its logistical capital and administrative services with respect to pharmacy franchising operations a few smaller franchisors compete with medicine shoppe and medicap in the franchising of pharmacies with competition being based primarily upon benefits offered to both the pharmacist and the customer access to thirdparty programs the reputation of the franchise and pricing medicine shoppe and medicap also need to be competitive with a pharmacist’s ongoing options to operate or work for an independent or chain pharmacy

risk factors that may affect future results 

although it is not possible to predict all risks that may affect future results these risks may include but are not limited to the following 

intense competition may erode the company’s profit margins the markets in which the company operates generally are highly competitive for example in its pharmaceutical distribution business the company competes with national wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors direct selling manufacturers selfwarehousing chains specialty distributors and thirdparty logistics companies competitive pressures across business segments have contributed to a decline in the company’s gross profit margins on revenue from approximately 4 in fiscal 2002 to 3 in fiscal 2005 this trend may continue and the company’s business could be adversely affected as a result 

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business is transitioning its business model which subjects the company to risks and uncertainties as discussed more fully under “customers and suppliers” within “item 1 business” the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business which is the company’s largest business is in a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for the logistical capital and administrative services it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that adequately compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers 

as part of the transition to feeforservice terms certain of the new distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with certain other branded manufacturers still continue to be solely inflationbased if branded pharmaceutical price inflation is lower than the company has anticipated its operating results could be adversely affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent feebased compensation in its pharmaceutical distribution business in addition certain key distribution service agreements will be renegotiated in the latter half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire if the terms of the renegotiated agreements are unfavorable to the company it could adversely affect the company’s operating results

the company’s internal controls may not be sufficient to ensure timely and reliable financial information as reported under item 9a of this form 10k the company’s management completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2005 and based on that assessment concluded that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2005 the company’s auditor ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment that expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting still however the company’s growth continues to place stress on its internal controls and there can be no assurance that the company’s control procedures will continue to be adequate the effectiveness of the company’s controls and procedures may be limited by a variety of risks including among other things faulty human judgment simple errors omissions and mistakes collusion of two or more people or inappropriate management override of procedures if the company fails to have effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in place it could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information 

changes in the united states health care environment may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results in recent years the health care industry has undergone significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs these efforts include but are not limited to potential national health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups including the efforts in several states to establish pharmaceutical purchasing programs on behalf of their residents this industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or operating results other factors related to the health care industry that could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results include but are not limited to 

 

the company’s medical products and services distribution business purchases medicalsurgical products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of such business to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer if this practice becomes more widespread the ability of the medical products and services distribution business to purchase products from other distributors as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors may be impaired this could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents to the extent that market conditions significantly alter the level of availability or pricing of generic drugs different from what the company was anticipating this could adversely affect the company’s net earnings 

there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state pharmacy boards and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system certain states such as florida and california have already adopted laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations these laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business and may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results 

there have been increasing efforts by various parties to introduce and pass legislation that would directly permit the importation of pharmaceutical products into the united states if such efforts are successful the price the company receives for pharmaceutical products and related services could be adversely affected thereby negatively impacting the company’s operating results 

the company is subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to increase its scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs furthermore the company’s relationships with pharmaceutical 

manufacturers and healthcare providers subject its business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse many of the regulations applicable to the company including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical or medicalsurgical suppliers are vague and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the company to make changes in its operations if the company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations it could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” the us government recently proposed changes in certain pharmaceutical reimbursement rates the company may be adversely affected by changes or changes that may be proposed in the future under the act the company is in the process of developing plans to mitigate any exposures from these changes in reimbursement rates and the way its customers conduct their business under the act however if the company fails to successfully implement such plans its business and the results of operations may be adversely affected 

the outcomes of lawsuits brought against the company may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results as discussed below under “item 3 legal proceedings” the company is subject to numerous lawsuits including several class action lawsuits against the company and certain of its former and present officers and directors any settlement of or judgment in one or more of these matters could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results there can be no assurance that all or any portion of the liability arising from these pending lawsuits will be covered by insurance policies that the company currently maintains 

the company could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more significant customers or group of customers or by a change in customer mix the company’s largest customers cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 21 and 10 respectively of the company’s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal 2005 the aggregate of the company’s five largest customers including cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately 37 of the company’s revenue by dollar volume for fiscal 2005 the company’s business and operating results could be adversely affected if the business of these customers was lost 

in addition certain of the company’s businesses have entered into agreements with gpos approximately 15 of the company’s revenue for fiscal 2005 was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation and premier generally compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary notwithstanding this fact the loss of such an agreement could adversely affect the company’s operating results see the “customers and suppliers” discussion within “item 1 business” and note 13 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information regarding the company’s significant customers 

changes in the company’s customer mix could also significantly impact its business financial condition or operating results due to the diverse range of health care supply management and health care information technology products and services that the company offers such changes may adversely affect certain of the company’s businesses while not affecting some of its competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

difficulties delays or increased costs in implementing the global restructuring program associated with the company’s one cardinal health initiative may adversely affect the anticipated benefit of the restructuring on the company’s business financial condition and operating results as discussed more fully in the “overview” section within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in fiscal 2005 the company launched a global restructuring program in connection with its one cardinal health initiative the company expects the program to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2008 and expects it to improve operating earnings and position the company for future growth if the restructuring program suffers unforeseen difficulties is delayed in its completion or results in unforeseen additional costs the company may not achieve the operational and financial objectives it has set for the program and the company’s business financial condition or operating results may not fully benefit from the restructuring to the extent that the company had initially anticipated 

in addition certain projects under the one cardinal health restructuring involve replacement of legacy systems consolidation and rationalization of employees and in some cases outsourcing during such transitions it is possible the company may suffer at least on a temporary basis problems associated with internal control over financial reporting or business interruptions which could arise as a result of such restructuring 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results the health care industry is highly regulated the company is subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the nrc dhhs the european union member states and other comparable agencies certain of the company’s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the nrc dhhs and various state boards of pharmacy state 

health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale although the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of the company’s operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits and licenses or obtain without significant delay future permits and licenses needed for the operation of the company’s businesses the clinical technologies and services segment’s automated pharmaceutical dispensing systems are not currently required to be registered or submitted for premarket notifications to the fda there can be no assurance however that fda policy in this regard will not change 

any noncompliance by the company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition if changes were to occur to the laws and regulations applicable to the company’s businesses such changes could adversely affect many of the company’s regulated operations which include 

 

also the health care regulatory environment may change in a manner that could restrict the company’s existing operations limit the expansion of the company’s businesses apply regulations to previously unregulated businesses or otherwise affect the company adversely 

the company’s operating results could be adversely affected by a delay in or failure to receive regulatory approval the company’s pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing businesses are heavily regulated and strict compliance with federal and foreign laws rules regulations and practices must be followed by nature the manufacturing of such products is a highly controlled process in which great strides are taken to avoid contamination in the products due to the regulatory issues and challenges there is a risk of delay in approval of these products which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

circumstances associated with the company’s acquisition strategy and internal growth may adversely affect the company’s operating results  an important element of the company’s growth strategy has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which expand or complement the company’s existing businesses over the past decade the company has expanded beyond its core pharmaceutical distribution business into areas such as medicalsurgical product manufacturing and distribution development and manufacturing of drug delivery systems development and manufacturing of automation and information products compounding and distribution of nuclear pharmaceutical products and developing manufacturing and distributing intravenous pumps and administration sets integrating businesses however involves a number of special risks including the following 

 

in addition the company may incur debt to finance future acquisitions andor may issue securities in connection with future acquisitions which may dilute the holdings of its current and future shareholders to the extent the company continues to pursue acquisitions its ability to complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government investigations described above under the risk factor entitled “the ongoing sec investigation and us attorney inquiry could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results” 

in addition to the risks associated with acquisitionrelated growth the company’s business has grown in size and complexity 

over the past few years as a result of internal growth this growth and increase in complexity have placed significant demands on management systems internal controls and financial and physical resources to meet such demands the company intends to continue to invest in new technology make other capital expenditures and where appropriate hire andor train employees with expertise to handle these particular demands if the company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner or if the company fails to efficiently manage operations in a way that accommodates continued internal growth its business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

downgrades of the company’s credit ratings could adversely affect the company the company’s senior debt credit ratings from sp moody’s and fitch are bbb baa3 and bbb respectively the commercial paper ratings are a3 p3 and f2 respectively and the ratings outlooks are “negative” “stable” and “negative” respectively although a ratings downgrade by any of the rating agencies will not trigger an acceleration of any of the company’s indebtedness these events may adversely affect its ability to access capital and would result in an increase in the interest rates payable under the company’s credit facilities and future indebtedness see also “liquidity and capital resources” within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the company could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not successful  the company’s operations depend in a large extent on the efforts of its senior management several new members of senior management including the company’s chairman and chief executive officer – pharmaceutical technologies and services chief financial officer chief ethics and compliance officer chief accounting officer and controller and treasurer have recently joined the company the company seeks to develop and retain an effective management team through the proper positioning of existing key employees and the addition of new management personnel where necessary the company’s operations could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not successful or if the company is unable to sustain an effective management team 

increased costs for raw materials or raw material shortages may adversely affect the company’s operating results as discussed more fully under “customers and suppliers” within “item 1 business” the company’s manufacturing businesses within the medical products and services and pharmaceutical technologies and services segments use a broad range of raw materials in the products that they produce in certain circumstances the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by increases in raw materials costs because the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity improvements in addition in the case where there are a limited number of suppliers for a particular raw material or where the company is constrained to use a particular supplier due to customer requirements regulatory filings or product approvals the company may experience shortages in supply this in turn could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

increased fuel costs may adversely affect the company’s operating results as discussed under “customers and suppliers” within “item 1 business” the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business utilizes contract carriers to distribute its products contracts with these carriers generally contain a fuel surcharge capped at a certain percentage if fuel costs rise significantly the pharmaceutical distribution business may need to increase the specified fuel surcharge which is limited to specified annual percentage increases with certain contract carriers in the event that the pharmaceutical distribution business cannot reach agreement on these changes it may need to replace the contract carriers at prevailing market rates the company’s medical products and services distribution and nuclear pharmacy services businesses own their distribution fleets which distribute a majority of their products to customers these businesses are directly impacted by market changes in the price of fuel as a result of the company’s exposure to fuel costs the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by increased fuel costs as the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from its customers 

proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and company products may infringe on the rights of third parties the company relies on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of its products services and intangible assets there can be no assurance that these protections will provide meaningful protection against competitive products or services or otherwise be commercially valuable or that the company will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing its intellectual property rights against unauthorized users there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company’s technology 

from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against the company and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future see the discussion of the icu medical inc litigation against alaris in the “overview” section within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” while the company believes that the products it currently manufactures using its proprietary technology do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other parties or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary there can be no assurance that the company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others 

additionally the company may be subject to litigation or find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect its trade secrets to enforce its patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could generate significant expenses damage payments or restrictions or prohibitions on the company’s use of its technology which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations in addition if the company is found to be infringing on proprietary rights of others the company may be required to develop noninfringing technology obtain a license or cease making using andor selling the infringing products 

risks generally associated with the company’s sophisticated information systems may adversely affect the company’s operating results the company relies on sophisticated information systems in its business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 

the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties 

the company could become subject to liability claims that are not adequately covered by insurance and may have to pay damages and other expenses which may have an adverse affect on the company’s operating results the company’s businesses expose it to risks that are inherent in 

 

insurance policies covering pharmaceutical product liability generally being offered by insurance carriers are becoming more restrictive in terms of selfinsured retentions available policy limits coverage exclusions and other terms there can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the company’s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and as such this could adversely effect the company’s operating results 

the loss of thirdparty licenses used by businesses within the company’s clinical technologies and services segment may adversely affect the company’s operating results the company licenses the rights to use certain technologies from thirdparty vendors to incorporate in or complement products and services offered through its clinical technologies and services segment these licenses are generally nonexclusive must be renewed periodically by mutual consent and may be terminated if the company breaches the terms of the license as a result the company may have to discontinue delay or reduce product shipments until it obtains equivalent technology which could adversely affect the company’s business the company’s competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with the company in addition if the company’s vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future the company may not be able to modify or adapt certain of its own products 

tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect the company’s net earnings the company is a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the company’s tax positions there can be no assurance that the company’s effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although the company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that the company’s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the company would be successful in any such challenge

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form 10k 

in connection with certain conclusions made by the audit committee during september and october 2004 as part of its ongoing internal review and prior to filing the 2004 form 10k the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements which were reflected in the 2004 form 10k as a result the company supplemented its historical disclosures within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” to reflect these reclassification and restatement adjustments on previously reported company and business segment operating earnings performance all prior period disclosures presented in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” have been adjusted to reflect these changes 

overview 

cardinal health is a leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry the company helps health care providers and manufacturers improve the efficiency and quality of health care for further information regarding the company’s business please see “part i item 1 business” within this form 10k 

results of operations 

the following summarizes the company’s results of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 

 the results of operations during the fiscal years noted in the table above reflect the breadth of products and services the company offers and the increasing demand for the company’s diverse portfolio of products and services which led to revenue growth in every segment of the company the company continues to experience strong demand from health care providers for the company to provide integrated solutions integrated solutions include products and services from multiple lines of businesses within the company and currently represent approximately 7 billion of annual sales 

the company’s operations are organized into four reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services and clinical technologies and services see note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal 2005 

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business is in a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for the logistical capital and administrative services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers historically the compensation received by the pharmaceutical distribution business from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each manufacturer’s unique sales practices eg volume of product available for sale eligibility to purchase product cash discounts for prompt payment rebates etc and pharmaceutical pricing practices eg the timing frequency and magnitude of product price increases specifically a significant portion of the compensation the pharmaceutical distribution business received from manufacturers was derived from the company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of pharmaceutical price increases hold that inventory as manufacturers increased pharmaceutical prices and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory this compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of each branded pharmaceutical manufacturer including established policies concerning the volume of product available for purchase in advance of a price increase and on predictable pharmaceutical pricing practices 

beginning in fiscal 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain and as a result began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers in addition manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from the company including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns the company believes that the manufacturers have sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes have significantly reduced the compensation received by the company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers as a result of these actions by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers the company concluded it was no longer being adequately and consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical capital and administrative services being provided by the company to these manufacturers 

in response to the developments discussed above the company has established a compensation system that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ sales or pricing practices and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer’s products during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that adequately compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers the initial feeforservice transition is essentially complete which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment 

as part of the transition to feeforservice terms certain of the new distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with certain other branded manufacturers still continue to be solely inflationbased if branded pharmaceutical price inflation is lower than the 

company has anticipated its operating results could be adversely affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent feebased compensation in its pharmaceutical distribution business in addition certain key distribution service agreements will be renegotiated in the latter half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire if the terms of the renegotiated agreements are unfavorable to the company it could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

revenue and operating earnings within the pyxis products business of the clinical technologies and services segment declined significantly during fiscal 2005 the decline was a result of the following 

 

the company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the pyxis products business in the shortterm and it remains confident in the longterm prospects for this business due to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the clinical technologies and services segment the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing customer demand for products and services focusing on patient safety during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal 2006 as evidenced by its increased committed contracts primarily for its new product pyxis medstation 3000 

operating earnings within the company’s pharmaceutical technologies and services segment declined during fiscal 2005 the decline was due in part to the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business including the humacao puerto rico facility the company decided to close the sterile manufacturing facility in humacao puerto rico as part of the global restructuring program associated with its one cardinal health initiative these operations had underperformed relative to company expectations due in part to continued regulatory issues at the facility the decision does not affect the company’s other operations in puerto rico or at other locations worldwide in addition the operating earnings decline within this segment was also the result of lower demand for medical communication services within the healthcare marketing services business the adverse conditions experienced by the segment were partially offset by the strength of certain softgel and controlled release products as well as the yearoveryear impact of acquisitions 

global restructuring program 

as previously reported during fiscal 2005 the company launched a global restructuring program in connection with its one cardinal health initiative with the goal of increasing the value the company provides its customers through better integration of existing businesses and improved efficiency from a more disciplined approach to procurement and resource allocation the company expects the program to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2008 and to improve operating earnings and position the company for future growth the actual operating earnings improvements for fiscal 2005 were estimated by the company to have been in excess of the expected improvement of 125 million the program is expected to improve operating earnings by approximately 190 million for fiscal 2006 

the company expects the program to be implemented in two phases the first phase of the program focuses on business consolidations and process improvements including rationalizing facilities worldwide reducing the company’s global workforce and rationalizing and discontinuing overlapping and underperforming product lines see the form 8k filed by the company on december 14 2004 for a description of the costs the company expects to incur in connection with the first phase of the program 

the second phase of the program will focus on longer term integration activities that will enhance service to customers through improved integration across the company’s segments and continue to streamline internal operations see the form 8k filed by the company on august 5 2005 for a description of the costs the company expects to incur in connection with the second phase of the program see notes 4 and 21 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for discussion of the restructuring costs incurred by the company during fiscal 2005 related to both phases of the global restructuring program 

government investigations and board committee internal reviews 

the company is currently the subject of a formal investigation by the sec relating to certain accounting matters and the us attorney for the southern district of new york is conducting an inquiry with respect to the company the company’s audit committee also is conducting its own internal review assisted by independent counsel which internal review is ongoing in addition a board committee with the assistance of independent counsel is separately conducting an internal review to assign responsibility for the matters relating to the company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers which internal review is also ongoing settlement discussions have recently commenced with the sec regarding resolution of its investigation with respect to the company and the company has recorded a reserve of 25 million for fiscal 2005 in respect of the sec investigation for further information regarding these matters see “part i item 3 legal proceedings” and note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in this form 10k 

product safety 

as a leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry including the distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products the company is monitoring issues regarding the safety of the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and other health care products the company will continue to work proactively with all participants and regulators in the pharmaceutical supply chain to help ensure it is safe and efficient the company continues to work with its suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain 

acquisitions 

on june 28 2004 the company acquired approximately 987 of the outstanding common stock of alaris a provider of intravenous medication safety products and services on july 7 2004 alaris merged with a subsidiary of the company to complete the transaction the value of the transaction including the assumption of alaris’ debt totaled approximately 21 billion for further information regarding the alaris acquisition the valuation of the acquisition’s intangibles and the impact on segment reporting see notes 4 17 and 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” prior to the completion of the alaris acquisition on june 16 2004 icu medical inc filed a patent infringement lawsuit against alaris in the united states district court for the southern district of california in the lawsuit icu claims that the alaris smartsite® family of needlefree values and systems infringes upon icu patents icu seeks monetary damages plus permanent injunctive relief preventing alaris from selling smartsite® products on july 30 2004 the court denied icu’s application for a preliminary injunction finding among other things that icu had failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits the company intends to vigorously defend this action 

during december 2003 the company completed its acquisition of intercare an european pharmaceutical products and services company the cash transaction was valued at approximately 570 million including the assumption of approximately 150 million in intercare debt see note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further information regarding the impact that this acquisition had on the company’s segment reporting 

during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 the company completed numerous acquisitions including alaris intercare and syncor the company’s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in expansion into areas that complement the company’s existing operations and provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with and strengthen the acquired business as the health care industry continues to change the company evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to take advantage of opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry through all its reporting segments there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully take advantage of any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued to the extent that the company continues to pursue acquisitions its ability to complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government investigations described under “part i item 3 legal proceedings” and note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in this form 10k if additional transactions are pursued or consummated the company would incur additional merger and acquisitionrelated costs and may need to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

results of operations 

the following sections provide additional detail regarding the results of operations of the company and where applicable the results of operations of the company’s reportable segments 

revenue 

revenue for the company and its reportable segments are as follows 

 

 

 the following table summarizes the revenue growth rates for the company and its reportable segments as well as the percent of company revenue excluding corporate each segment represents 

 

 

   total company total company revenue increased 15 during each of fiscal 2005 and 2004 the revenue growth in these fiscal years resulted from the following 

 

 

these increases during fiscal 2005 were partially offset by slower revenue growth within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment and a decline in revenue from pyxis products within the clinical technologies and services segment 

  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services revenue growth of 16 in fiscal 2005 resulted from strong sales to customers within this segment’s core pharmaceutical distribution business the most significant growth was in “bulk revenue” defined below which increased approximately 34 see the bulk revenue discussion below for further details in addition annualized pharmaceutical price increases of approximately 49 contributed to the growth in this segment however the rate of price increases was lower than the rate experienced over the prior fiscal year 

as discussed in note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in this form 10k during fiscal 2004 the company decided to aggregate revenue classes “operating revenue” and “bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other” were combined for all periods presented so that total revenue and total cost of products sold are presented as single amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings beginning with the 2004 form 10k information concerning the portion of the company’s revenue that arises from bulk revenue is discussed in the company’s “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for more information regarding this reclassification see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment reports transactions with the following characteristics as “bulk revenue” 

 

bulk revenue for fiscal 2005 was 241 billion compared to 180 billion in fiscal 2004 the increase in bulk revenue primarily relates to additional volume from existing and new customers as well as market growth within the mail order business the increase from existing customers is primarily due to certain customers purchasing from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer 

the company continues to provide disclosure concerning its bulk sales due to the differences in the nature and character of the business activities associated with bulk and nonbulk revenues nonbulk activities tend to be more complex as the company receives inventory in large or full case sizes from the manufacturer breaks it down into smaller sizes warehouses the product picks products specific to a customer’s order and delivers that order to customer locations such as retail pharmacies or individual hospitals generally on a justintime basis and in small sizes while certain of the above activities occur with some bulk transactions bulk typically involves much larger sizes generally in unopened cases or full pallets which are shipped either directly from the manufacturer or from the company to customers’ own warehousing facilities 

the company’s classification of sales as bulk or nonbulk also corresponds to its four business operations within pharmaceutical distribution applying the definition set forth above all revenue in the brokerage and trading operations is classified as bulk all revenue in the repackaging operation is classified as nonbulk within the core facilities operation revenue is classified as bulk or nonbulk on a customerbycustomer basis based solely upon the type of customer involved shipments to warehouses and processing centers primarily retail chain and mail order customers are classified as bulk revenue all other core facilities revenue is classified as nonbulk revenue 

this segment’s revenue growth of 14 in fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from strong sales to existing customers sales to new customers and pharmaceutical price increases sales growth to existing customers within the retail chain and alternate site categories in this segment’s pharmaceutical distribution business showed particular strength this segment also benefited from contract wins during fiscal 2004 pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately 62 during fiscal 2004 and an extra business day these revenue gains were partially dampened by continued reduction in business with kmart holding corp “kmart” due to kmart’s closure of various stores and certain contract losses during fiscal 2004 in this segment’s pharmaceutical distribution business 

  medical products and services the medical products and services revenue growth of 7 in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from increased volume from existing customers new contracts signed during fiscal 2004 within the medicalsurgical distribution business strong international growth especially in canada and europe favorable foreign exchange translation and increased revenue from the specialty distribution business the 6 growth in the medicalsurgical distribution business was primarily from increased sales to hospital supply and ambulatory care customers and the 11 growth within the specialty distribution business resulted from increased revenue from the business’ largest customer and growth of the existing customer base this segment’s revenue growth was adversely affected by slower growth in the sale of selfmanufactured products and the loss of certain business from customers within a gpo 

the specialty distribution business’ largest customer has notified the company that they will begin self distribution on january 1 2006 which will significantly impact revenue and operating earnings for this business during the second half of fiscal 2006 this customer represented approximately 15 billion or 16 of this segment’s fiscal 2005 revenue the company plans to partially mitigate this loss through the addition of a large new customer agreement signed in april 2005 and cost cutting measures 

this segment’s revenue growth of 14 in fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from increased sales momentum from new and existing contracts within the distribution business as well as from increased sales volume from the segment’s international businesses new contracts drove increased sales of both distributed and selfmanufactured products with sales from the distribution business particularly strong during fiscal 2004 the international businesses also generated strong revenue growth increasing nearly 19 from the prior fiscal year approximately 14 of the international business revenue growth related to 

changes in foreign currency rates sales of new selfmanufactured products particularly enhancements within surgeon glove products also contributed to the overall revenue growth this segment’s revenue growth was above industry averages during fiscal 2004 

  pharmaceutical technologies and services the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment’s revenue growth of 6 in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from strong demand for certain softgel products the impact of acquisitions primarily intercare and the acquisition of geodax within the nuclear pharmacy services business and the impact of foreign exchange rates revenue growth was offset by certain regulatory issues as noted below the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures within this segment accounted for approximately 5 of the revenue growth in fiscal 2005 revenue in fiscal 2005 increased by approximately 2 as a result of the impact of foreign exchange rates this impact takes into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the us dollar and the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment see footnote 6 to the table in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional discussion as it relates to fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment the segment’s growth was adversely affected by the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the company’s biotechnology and sterile life sciences business including underperformance at the humacao puerto rico facility the segment’s growth was also adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services within the healthcare marketing services business 

this segment’s revenue growth of 25 in fiscal 2004 resulted from acquisitions and sales momentum within the pharmaceutical development nuclear pharmacy services and packaging services businesses approximately 5 of this segment’s revenue growth was due to the inclusion of intercare an acquisition completed during december 2003 intercare’s results of operations are not included in the prior period amounts intercare’s operations had considerable sales momentum after the acquisition was completed particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 also this segment’s revenue growth benefited from the inclusion of syncor an acquisition that was completed on january 1 2003 syncor’s results of operations are not included in the amounts for the first half fiscal 2003 acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately 23 of the revenue growth during fiscal 2004 

this segment’s fiscal 2004 revenue growth was partially dampened by a delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of key sterile products from signed contracts as certain regulatory inspections and product approvals were delayed in the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business revenue growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the company applied constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations’ revenue into us dollars the impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes is retained within the corporate segment see footnote 6 of the table in note 18 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  clinical technologies and services the clinical technologies and services revenue growth of 41 in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of alaris and strong revenue growth within the clinical services and consulting business offset by significant revenue declines within the pyxis products business the alaris acquisition accounted for approximately 41 of this segment’s total revenue growth for fiscal 2005 alaris’ results of operations are not included in the prior period amounts the pyxis products business experienced a revenue decline of approximately 17 in fiscal 2005 due to the following 

 

the company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the pyxis products business’ in the shortterm and it remains confident in the longterm prospects for this business due to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the clinical technologies and services segment the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing customer demand for products and services focusing on patient safety during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal 2006 as evidenced by its increased committed contracts primarily for its new product pyxis medstation 3000 

in fiscal 2004 the pyxis products business sold portions of its leased asset portfolio at the direction of corporate the proceeds were transferred to corporate and the pyxis products business subsequently received a 210 million allocation from corporate related to the estimated interest income that would have been earned had the associated lease portfolios not been sold this allocation was recorded within revenue consistent with the recording of interest income received from salestype leases effective the first quarter of fiscal 2005 the pyxis products business did not receive this corporate allocation see footnote 6 to the table in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further details 

the clinical technologies and services segment’s revenue growth of 10 in fiscal 2004 is reflective of the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the audit committee’s internal review as more fully described in note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” operationally this segment’s revenue growth in fiscal 2004 included sales growth within the medication product lines such as the pyxis medstation ® system the addition of new products and 12 growth within the clinical services and consulting business this segment was adversely affected by a softening of demand at the hospital level for pyxis products as discussed above in order to aid in the comparability of this segment’s operating results during fiscal 2004 the company recorded a corporate allocation adjustment to this segment’s revenue of 210 million representing an estimate of interest income this segment would have earned had the company not completed sales of its lease receivables 

operating earnings 

operating earnings for the company and its reportable segments are as follows 

 

 

 the following table summarizes the operating earnings growth rates for the company and its reportable segments as well as the percent of company operating earnings excluding corporate each segment represents 

 

  

 39 

 total company operating earnings decreased 25 and increased 7 during fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively the following paragraphs provide a description of the varying dynamics affecting the total company’s operating earnings for fiscal 2005 and 2004 

  total company total company operating earnings decreased 25 during fiscal 2005 as a result of declining operating earnings in each of the company’s reportable segments the company’s gross margins were dampened primarily by the following 

 

total company operating earnings were also adversely affected by the unfavorable impact related to special items of 2642 million in fiscal 2005 these increased costs related to the company’s global restructuring program associated with its one cardinal health initiative the sec investigation and audit committee internal review and related matters and the integration of certain acquisitions which were partially offset by settlements received in antitrust and vitamin litigation see note 4 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

in addition the company recorded 1180 million for asset impairments during fiscal 2005 compared to gains of 115 million in fiscal 2004 see note 21 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information total company operating earnings for fiscal 2005 were also impacted by the following 

 

total company operating earnings increased 7 during fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of the company’s revenue growth of 15 during the same time period which yielded a gross margin increase of 6 gross margins grew at a slower rate than revenue primarily as a result of the following 

 

 

the overall increase in gross margin in fiscal 2004 reflects the increased contributions from the company’s operating segments outside of the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment which generate higher gross margins and operating earnings as a percentage of revenue these segments accounted for more than onehalf of the company’s operating earnings acquisitions completed by the company accounted for approximately 3 of the operating earnings growth 

the increases in revenue and gross margin were partially offset by a 4 increase in selling general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2004 as well as an increase of 175 million in the company’s special items the overall increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of the additional expenses resulting from acquisitions higher personnel costs associated with overall business growth and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs additionally the company continued to invest in research and development and strategic initiatives that will benefit future periods investments of approximately 115 million in fiscal 2004 were charged against current operating earnings as incurred these increases in selling general and administrative expenses were offset partially by a reduction versus the prior fiscal year in incentive compensation expenses of approximately 64 million due to the performance of the company’s consolidated operations relative to management’s expectations and established financial performance metrics such reduction affected all of the company’s business segments the expense increases were also offset by adjustments of certain trade receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses with a combined impact of approximately 10 million due to changes in customerspecific credit exposures and improvements in customer credit billing and collection processes yielding significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts in addition operating earnings included 115 million of net gains on the sale of certain businesses and assets which were recorded in “impairment charges and other” 

  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services operating earnings decreased 2 during fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of reduced vendor margins resulting from changes in branded pharmaceutical manufacturers’ sales and pricing practices as discussed above in the “overview” section and competitive pricing pressures as discussed above branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have changed their sales practices by restricting product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers in addition branded pharmaceutical manufacturers’ product pricing practices have become less predictable as the frequency of price increases has slowed and the amounts have decreased versus historical levels for fiscal 2005 annualized pharmaceutical price increases were approximately 49 compared to 62 in fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2005 the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define feeforservice terms that adequately compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers the initial feeforservice transition is essentially complete which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment 

this segment’s operating earnings were also favorably impacted by 317 million from changes in the lifo reserve primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical inventories operating earnings were also impacted by improved margins from generic products and expense control within the pharmaceutical distribution business which resulted in lowering selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in addition operating earnings during fiscal 2005 were adversely impacted by approximately 147 million for inventory reserves related to a generic manufacturer’s bankruptcy approximately 100 million related to slow moving inventory reserves and approximately 78 million as a result of inventory rationalization of certain health and beauty care products 

this segment’s operating earnings decreased 2 during fiscal 2004 primarily due to reduced vendor margins caused by the changing business model within the pharmaceutical distribution business as further described in the “overview” section and the impact of competitive pricing other adjustments within the pharmaceutical distribution business that negatively impacted this segment in fiscal 2004 included an increase in inventory valuation and vendor dispute reserves in the fourth quarter of approximately 117 million and an adverse adjustment in the third quarter of approximately 92 million for vendor margins in addition one of several aspects of the business model transition adversely impacting pharmaceutical distribution’s yearoveryear operating earnings was the change in estimation of vendor margin with generic health and beauty products and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an impact of approximately 153 million these declines were partially offset by the following 

 

 

  medical products and services the medical products and services segment’s operating earnings decreased 3 during fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of pricing pressures related to selfmanufactured products increased raw material and fuel costs an increased mix of lower margin distributed products and competitive pricing on a large gpo contract operating earnings were also adversely impacted by a 282 million charge for latex litigation as more fully described within note 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” selling general and administrative expenses grew 10 during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the charge for latex litigation described above and higher personnel costs associated with the overall business growth these items were partially offset by revenue growth of 7 manufacturing efficiencies expense control related to the company’s global restructuring program and incremental operating earnings from new customers 

this segment’s operating earnings growth of 11 during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from revenue growth of 14 during the same time period led by sales momentum from distribution contracts and gains within international markets this segment also realized manufacturing productivity improvements resulting in gross margin gains in addition operating earnings benefited from lower incentive compensation expense versus prior year this segment’s operating earnings growth was partially dampened by the increased mix of lower margin distributed products competitive pricing within the industry and an increase of approximately 9 million in raw material prices 

  pharmaceutical technologies and services the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment’s operating earnings decreased 28 during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the company’s biotechnology and sterile life sciences business including underperformance at the humacao puerto rico facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company decided to close the sterile manufacturing facility in humacao puerto rico as part of its global restructuring program these operations had underperformed relative to company expectations due in part to continued regulatory issues at the facility the decision does not affect the company’s other operations in puerto rico or at other locations worldwide 

in addition the operating earnings in this segment’s healthcare marketing services business were adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services operating earnings were also adversely impacted by approximately 80 million related to the write down of inventory within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business the operating earnings declines were partially offset by the strength of certain softgel and controlled release products and the yearoveryear impact of acquisitions of approximately 6 the impact of foreign exchange rates on operating earnings did not significantly affect the fiscal 2005 growth rates above this takes into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the us dollar and the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment see footnote 6 to the table in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment and the change made in fiscal 2005 

this segment’s operating earnings growth of 26 during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from revenue growth of 25 during the same time period with sales momentum in the pharmaceutical development nuclear pharmacy services and packaging services businesses showing particular strength this segment also benefited from acquisitions completed by the company specifically intercare and syncor the acquisition of intercare was completed during the second quarter fiscal 2004 and therefore its results of operations are not included in the prior period also syncor’s results of operations are not included in the first half of fiscal 2003 because the acquisition was completed on january 1 2003 acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately 18 of the operating earnings growth during fiscal 2004 

this segment’s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively impacted by the increase in services provided by the nuclear pharmacy services business which has a lower gross margin ratio as compared to the other businesses within this segment the segment’s operating earnings also benefited yearoveryear by reduced incentive compensation expenses operating earnings growth was dampened by the delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of certain sterile products as discussed in this segment’s revenue discussion in addition this segment’s fiscal 2004 operating earnings growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the company applied constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations’ operating earnings into us dollars the impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes was retained within the corporate segment in fiscal 2004 see footnote 6 to the table in note 18 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment and the change made in fiscal 2005 

  clinical technologies and services the clinical technologies and services segment’s operating earnings decreased 19 during fiscal 2005 primarily from decreased operating earnings within the pyxis products business that were not completely offset by the acquisition benefit from the alaris transaction the pyxis products business performance was impacted by 

 

the alaris acquisition improved operating earnings by approximately 26 for fiscal 2005 the results of operations from this acquisition are not included in the prior period amounts operating results from alaris while incremental to the segment’s results yearoveryear were adversely impacted by the effect of purchase accounting adjustments recorded during the first two quarters of fiscal 2005 these adjustments included an inventory valuation adjustment to “fair value” and the adjusted higher cost inventory being sold which adversely affected gross margins by approximately 236 million 

this segment’s operating earnings growth of 6 during fiscal 2004 was impacted by the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the audit committee’s internal review as more fully described in note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” this segment’s operating earnings growth during fiscal 2004 resulted in part from this segment’s revenue growth of 10 during the same time period in conjunction with operational improvements within the pyxis products business and expense control within the clinical services and consulting business in addition this segment benefited from a reduction in receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses with a combined impact of approximately 82 million due to improvements in customerspecific credit matters and general improvements in customer credit billing and collection procedures resulting in significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts 

the segment’s fiscal 2004 operating earnings also benefited yearoveryear from reduced incentive compensation expenses and a corporate expense allocation of 15 million as mentioned in this segment’s revenue discussion the company recorded for comparative purposes a corporate allocation of 210 million to this segment representing estimated interest income this segment would have earned had the company not initiated the sale of its lease receivables see this segment’s discussion under “revenue” for additional information regarding this allocation entry in fiscal 2004 

impairment charges and other 

see note 21 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding “impairment charges and other” 

special items 

the following is a summary of the company’s special items 

 

see note 4 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for detail of the company’s special items during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 

interest expense and other 

 “interest expense and other” increased 231 million during fiscal 2005 primarily from increased interest expense of 548 million due to increased borrowing levels and rates the company manages its exposure to interest rates using various hedging strategies see notes 3 and 7 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” the 548 million increase in interest expense during fiscal 2005 was partially offset by the company recording the minority interest impact of approximately 194 million for certain impairment charges within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment’s oral technologies business these impairment charges were recorded within “impairment charges and other” on the consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal 2005 see note 21 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding “impairment charges and other” 

the increase in “interest expense and other” of 41 million during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from the adverse yearover year impact of foreign exchange rates and the impact of a gain recognized in fiscal 2003 related to a speculative interest rate swap transaction which were partially offset by decreased interest expense 

provision for income taxes 

the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting were 358 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2005 319 in fiscal 2004 and 336 in fiscal 2003 the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005 includes tax expense related to a planned repatriation of foreign earnings as provided for in the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “ajca” see the following paragraph generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within state and foreign effective tax rates resulting from the company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the taxing jurisdiction the company’s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations outside the united states which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 35 the company has subsidiaries operating in puerto rico under a tax incentive agreement expiring in 2019 as well as a tax agreement in place with thailand that expires in 2013 

on october 22 2004 the ajca was signed into law a provision of the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company determined that it will repatriate 500 million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the ajca and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of 263 million as of june 30 2005 the 500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the company under the repatriation provisions of the ajca see note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

earningsloss from discontinued operations 

see note 22 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information on the company’s discontinued operations 

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates 

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 3 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company also provides financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from one to ten years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation these financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company’s management 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes general and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable agings industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks if the frequency or severity of customer defaults increases due to changes in customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions the company’s allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment 

the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of customer receivables was 29 and 33 at june 30 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease was a result of adjustments to certain trade receivable reserves due to changes in customerspecific credit exposures historical writeoff trends and improvements in customer credit billing and collections processes a hypothetical 01 increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables to the fiscal 2005 reserve would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 44 million the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal year 2005 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed the total reserve at june 30 2005 and 2004 exceeds the total company receivable balance greater than 60 days past due at those same dates see schedule ii included in this form 10k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 

inventories a substantial portion of inventories approximately 67 in 2005 and 66 in 2004 are stated at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core distribution facilities within the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business and are primarily merchandise inventories the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout “fifo” method or market if the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have increased 260 million and 578 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively 

below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory 

 

inventories recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than the company’s assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

goodwill the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist accordingly the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue to be amortized over their useful lives 

in conducting the impairment test the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment 

the company’s impairment analysis is based on a review of the priceearnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature scope and size or a discounted cash flow analysis the use of alternative estimates peer groups or changes in the industry could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment any identified impairment would result in adjustment to the company’s results of operations the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal 2005 and 2004 neither of which resulted in the recognition of any impairment charges see note 17 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding goodwill 

business combinations assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value the company typically utilizes thirdparty valuation experts “valuation experts” for this process in addition current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles excluding goodwill the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 

in conjunction with the review of a transaction the valuation experts assess the status of the acquired company’s research and development projects to determine the existence of inprocess research and development “iprd” the company has not historically recorded significant costs related to iprd however in conjunction with the acquisition of alaris the company was 

required to estimate the fair value of acquired iprd which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project management also assessed the current status of development nature and timing of efforts to complete such development uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value costs were not assigned to iprd unless future development was probable once the fair value was determined an asset was established and as required by gaap immediately writtenoff as a special item in the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company recorded 127 million as a special item in fiscal 2004 representing an estimate of alaris’ iprd see note 4 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

special items the company’s special items consist primarily of costs that relate to the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method have been recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 100 “restructuring and impairment charges” certain costs related to these acquisitions such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs were recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by management certain other integration costs that did not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been implemented 

the costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” certain costs to be incurred by the company as the acquirer such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs are recognized at the date the integration plan is committed to and adopted by management certain other integration costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is implemented 

at the beginning of the third quarter fiscal 2003 the company implemented sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” to account for costs incurred in restructuring activities under this standard a liability for most types of exit costs is recognized as incurred as discussed above the company previously accounted for costs associated with restructuring activities under eitf issue no 943 which required the company to recognize a liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan 

the majority of the special items related to acquisitions and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employeerelated costs exit costs including lease termination costs asset impairments and other integration costs employee costs include severance and termination benefits lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company’s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 

the company also records settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent nonrecurring or unusual in nature as special items in addition costs related to legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the sec investigation and the audit committee internal review and related matters are also classified as special items see note 4 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information 

vendor reserves in determining an appropriate vendor reserve the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims the company researches and resolves contested transactions based on discussions with vendors company policy and findings of research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company’s original estimate and may require adjustment however the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

income tax reserves the company has established an estimated liability for federal state and foreign income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” this liability addresses a number of issues for which the company may have to pay additional taxes and interest when all examinations by taxing authorities are concluded 

the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances a thorough research of the technical merits of the company’s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments in all cases the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities the company generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its 

conclusions amounts accrued for a particular period are not adjusted upward or downward unless a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred and been formally documented 

loss contingencies the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 5 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 

self insurance accruals the company is selfinsured for employee medical and dental insurance programs the company had recorded liabilities totaling 260 million and 230 million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june 30 2005 and 2004 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported these estimates are based on the company’s assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis and current payment trends the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month the impact on earnings would be 55 million however the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

the company has certain deductibles or is selfinsured for various claims including general liability product pharmacist professional auto and workers’ compensation the company had recorded liabilities totaling 664 million and 480 million for anticipated costs related to general liability and workers’ compensation at june 30 2005 and 2004 respectively these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims defense costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported these estimates are based on the company’s assessment of outstanding claims historical analysis actuarial information and current payment trends the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters may differ from these estimates 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005 totaled approximately 29 billion an increase of 2255 million when compared to fiscal 2004 the increase was primarily the result of net proceeds of 550 million during the year under the company’s committed receivables sales facility program see note 10 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding this program overall the operating cash flow benefits were adversely affected by a 4780 million decrease in earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting a significant portion of the earnings decrease was due to noncash asset impairments of approximately 2239 million for further discussion of changes in the company’s earnings from continuing operations see the “results of operations” section above

cash provided by operating activities nearly doubled during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and increased earnings from continuing operations the primary driver of the increase in accounts payable was the timing of payments at fiscal yearend as well as inventory buys executed shortly before fiscal yearend within the company’s pharmaceutical distribution business in addition as a result of certain nonrecurring end of year arrangements payments to vendors in fiscal 2004 were reduced by 258 million due to the acceleration of payments at june 30 2003 to selected pharmaceutical vendors such arrangements resulted in changes to the original payment terms with the vendors for which an 

economic consideration was exchanged between the parties the company’s overall investment in inventories declined during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily to the changing business model of the pharmaceutical distribution business see the “overview” section earlier within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of changes in the company’s earnings from continuing operations see the “results of operations” section additionally the company’s operating cash flow benefited by approximately 993 million during fiscal 2004 due to sales of lease receivables from the company’s clinical technologies and services segment see note 10 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” for information regarding sales of lease receivables

 interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of the company’s longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors the company’s policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management the company utilizes interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate movements 

as part of its risk management program the company annually performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates at june 30 2005 and 2004 the potential increase or decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 46 million and 64 million respectively 

commodity price sensitivity the company purchases certain commodities for use in its manufacturing processes which include rubber heating oil diesel fuel and polystyrene the company typically purchases these commodities at market prices and as a result is affected by price fluctuations as part of its risk management program the company performs sensitivity analysis on its forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year at june 30 2005 and 2004 the company had not hedged any of these exposures the table below summarizes the company’s analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices as of june 30 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 the company also has exposure to certain energy related commodities including natural gas and electricity through its normal course of business these exposures result primarily from operating the company’s distribution manufacturing and corporate facilities in certain deregulated markets the company from time to time enters into longterm purchase contracts to supply these items at a specific price

the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the exchange act such as this form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 

as disclosed in notes 1 and 2 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” and described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” prior to filing the 2004 form 10k the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements as a result of the internal review undertaken by the audit committee with respect to certain accounting matters specifically the company restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000 2001 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 reclassified certain categories of revenue reduced its fourth quarter fiscal 2004 results for premature revenue recognition in its former automation and information services segment and expanded disclosure the reclassification and restatement adjustments were reflected in the 2004 form 10k 

in connection with the audit committee’s internal review since the end of fiscal 2004 the company has adopted and is in the process of implementing various measures in connection with the company’s ongoing efforts to improve its internal control processes and corporate governance these measures include the following 

 

the company believes that the implementation of the enhancements identified above as well as other control and governance enhancements have remediated the “material weaknesses” as defined under standards established by the public company accounting oversight board in the company’s entity level controls relating to the company’s control environment through june 30 2004 and with respect to the timing of revenue recognition within the company’s former automation and information services segment which material weaknesses were identified and communicated to the company by its independent auditors prior to the filing of the 2004 form 10k 

in addition the company and the audit committee will continue to implement enhancements in the company’s control processes as necessary in response to specific accounting and reporting issues arising out of the audit committee’s internal review the company will continue to develop policies and procedures and reinforce compliance with existing policies and procedures in the company’s effort to constantly improve its internal control environment 

  evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  the company carried out an evaluation as required by rule 13a15b under the exchange act with the participation of the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2005 based on this evaluation the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2005 

  management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2005 in making this assessment management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso criteria” 

based on management’s assessment and the coso criteria management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2005 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report appears below under this item 9a and expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  changes in internal control over financial reporting  with the exception of certain of the measures detailed above including the company appointing a new chief financial officer a new chief ethics and compliance officer and a new chief accounting officer and controller during the quarter ended june 30 2005 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting 

  significant deficiencies  as noted above management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2005 did not result in the identification of any material weaknesses however the company has identified a limited number of “significant deficiencies” as defined under standards by the public company accounting oversight board that do not in the aggregate rise to the level of a material weakness the company has developed specific action plans to address each of these significant deficiencies 

the company’s management including its principal executive officer and the principal financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected the company monitors its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and makes modifications as necessary the company’s intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and the internal controls will be maintained as dynamic systems that change including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant notwithstanding the foregoing and as discussed above under this item 9a the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2005 in addition also as discussed above the company’s management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2005

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

customers and suppliers

         the companys largest retail distribution customer in its
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment cvs meridian inc
cvs accounted for approximately 13 of the companys operating revenues by
dollar volume for fiscal year 2003 the company could be adversely affected if
the business of this customer were lost the two largest retail bulk
distribution customers in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services
segment are cvs and walgreens co walgreens accounting for approximately
61 and 23 respectively of all bulk deliveries in fiscal 2003 due to the
lack of margin generated through bulk deliveries fluctuations in their
purchases would have no significant impact on the segments earnings novation
llc novation a group purchasing organization a gpo has business
arrangements with the company that accounted for approximately 11 of the
companys operating revenues by dollar volume in fiscal 2003 through the
companys pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products
and services and automation and information services segments the company could
be adversely affected if the business arrangement with this gpo were lost
although the loss of the business arrangement with the gpo would not mean the
loss of sales to all members of the gpo

         the company obtains its products from many different suppliers the
largest of which pfizer inc accounted for approximately 11 by dollar
volume of the companys total revenue in fiscal 2003 the companys five
largest suppliers combined accounted for approximately 37 by dollar volume of
the companys total revenue during fiscal 2003 and overall the companys
relationships with its suppliers are good the companys arrangements with its
pharmaceutical suppliers typically may

                                        5

be canceled by either the company or the supplier upon 30 to 90 days prior
notice although many of these arrangements are not governed by formal
agreements the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect the companys
business if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable rates

         the companys pharmaceutical distribution business generates operating
margin in many ways from its vendors including inventory investment buying
opportunities rebates vendor program arrangements agreements and offerings
the company has seen changes in supply chain management policies of certain
vendors related to product availability including the use of inventory
management agreements under these types of agreements the company is generally
compensated on a negotiated basis to help manufacturers better match their
shipments with market demand these types of agreements and policies limit the
ability of the company to invest capital in pharmaceutical inventories in
advance of price increases and also decrease the availability of excess
inventory for sale through the companys noncore wholesaletowholesale
pharmaceutical trading business in the future vendors may continue with
similar arrangements that could limit the availability of excess inventory and
correspondingly have a negative impact on the companys investment inventory
margins

         while certain of the companys operations may show quarterly
fluctuations the company does not consider its business to be seasonal in
nature on a consolidated basis

range of health care supply management and health care information technology
products and services that the company offers such changes may adversely impact
certain of the companys businesses while not affecting some of its competitors
who offer a narrower range of products and services

affect the companys results of operations and financial condition the health
care industry is highly regulated the company is subject to various local
state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include
the operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards
of pharmacy state health departments the nrc the hhs and other comparable
agencies certain of the companys subsidiaries may be required to register for

risks generally associated with the companys acquisition strategy and internal
growth may adversely affect the companys operating results an important
element of the companys growth strategy has been and is expected to continue
to be the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which expand or
complement the companys existing businesses over the past several years the
company has expanded beyond its core pharmaceutical distribution business into
areas such as medicalsurgical product manufacturing and distribution
development and manufacturing of drug delivery systems development and
manufacturing of automation and information products and compounding and
distribution of nuclear pharmaceutical products integrating businesses
however involves a number of special risks including the possibility that
management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to
integrate operations unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and
systems problems assimilating and retaining the companys employees or the
employees of the acquired company accounting issues that could arise in
connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company
regulatory or compliance issues that could exist at an acquired company
challenges in retaining the companys customers or of the acquired company
following the acquisition and potential adverse short term effects on operating
results through increased costs or otherwise while the company has not
experienced any material integration problems in recent years the possibility
of integration issues increases when the company ventures outside its core
businesses in addition the company may incur debt to finance future
acquisitions andor may issue securities in connection with future acquisitions
which may dilute the holdings of its current and future shareholders in
addition to the risks associated with acquisitionrelated growth the companys
business has grown in size and complexity over the past few years as a result of
internal growth this growth and increase in complexity have placed significant
demands on management systems internal controls and financial and physical
resources to meet such demands the company intends to continue to hire new
employees invest in new technology and make other capital expenditures if the
company is unable to successfully and timely complete and integrate strategic
acquisitions or if the company fails to efficiently manage operations in a way
that accommodates continued internal growth its business financial condition
or results of operations could be adversely impacted

inventory to take advantage of relevant market dynamics including anticipated
manufacturer price increases the company recently has seen changes in vendor
supply chain management policies related to product availability including the
use of inventory management agreements inventory management agreements
generally provide for the distributor to be compensated on a negotiated basis to
help manufacturers better match their shipments to meet market demand thereby
resulting in less surplus inventory available to the distributor continued
changes in vendor policies related to product availability may limit the
companys ability to leverage its resources and could adversely impact the

latex litigation

         on september 30 1996 baxter international inc baxter and its
subsidiaries transferred to allegiance and its subsidiaries baxters us health
care distribution business surgical and respiratory therapy business and health
care costsaving business as well as certain foreign operations the allegiance
business in connection with a spinoff of the allegiance business by baxter
the baxterallegiance spinoff in connection with this spinoff
allegiance which merged with a subsidiary of the company on february 3 1999
agreed to indemnify baxter and to defend and indemnify baxter healthcare
corporation bhc as contemplated by the agreements between baxter and
allegiance for all expenses and potential liabilities associated with claims
arising from the allegiance business including certain claims of alleged
personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves the

settlements to the plaintiffs

page

         as of june 30 2003 there were 233 lawsuits pending against bhc andor
allegiance involving allegations of sensitization to natural rubber latex
products and some of these cases were proceeding to trial the total dollar
amount of potential damages cannot be reasonably quantified some plaintiffs
plead damages in extreme excess of what they reasonably can expect to recover
some plead a modest amount and some do not include a request for any specific
dollar amount not including cases that ask for no specific damages the damage
requests per action have ranged from 10000 to 240 million all of these cases
name multiple defendants in addition to baxterallegiance the average number
of defendants per case exceeds twentyfive based on the significant differences
in the range of damages sought and based on the multiple number of defendants in
these lawsuits allegiance cannot reasonably quantify the total amount of
possibleprobable damages therefore allegiance and the company do not believe
that these numbers should be considered as an indication of either reasonably
possible or probable liability

         since the inception of this litigation baxterallegiance have been
named as a defendant in 833 cases during the fiscal year ended june 30 2002
allegiance began settling some of these lawsuits with greater frequency as of
june 30 2003 allegiance had resolved more than seventy percent of these cases
about twenty percent of the lawsuits that have been resolved were concluded
without any liability to baxterallegiance no individual claim has been settled
for a material amount nor have all the settled claims in the aggregate
comprised a material amount due to the number of claims filed and the ongoing
defense costs that will be incurred allegiance believes it is probable that it
will incur substantial legal fees related to the resolution of the cases still
pending although the company continues to believe that it cannot reasonably
estimate the potential cost to settle these lawsuits the company believes that
the impact of such lawsuits upon allegiance will be immaterial to the companys
financial position liquidity or results of operations and could be in the
range of 0 to 20 million net of insurance proceeds with the range reflecting
the companys reasonable estimation of potential insurance coverage and defense
and indemnity costs the company believes a substantial portion of any
liability will be covered by insurance policies allegiance has with financially
viable insurance companies subject to selfinsurance retentions exclusions
conditions coverage gaps policy limits and insurer solvency the company and
allegiance continue to believe that insurance recovery is probable

injunctive relief after the lawsuit was filed it was consolidated for
pretrial purposes with other similar cases the case is pending in the united
states district court for the district of columbia where it was transferred

majority of the defendants in consideration of payments of approximately 1382
million net of attorney fees payments due to other interested parties and
expenses withheld prior to the disbursement of the funds to scherer while the
company still has pending claims with smaller vitamin manufacturers and cannot
predict the outcome of the claims against those defendants the total amount of
any future recovery will not likely represent a material amount

         operating revenue for a given year as a percentage of the operating
         revenue in the immediately preceding year

         total operating revenue increased 14 and 15 during fiscal 2003 and
2002 respectively the increase in fiscal 2003 resulted from a higher sales
volume across each of the companys segments strong sales of selfmanufactured
products the addition of new products the addition of new customers some of
which was a result of new corporate agreements with health care

                                       20

providers and pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately 5 in
addition the syncor acquisition within the pharmaceutical technologies and
services segment accounted for approximately 1 of the overall growth of the
company during fiscal 2003 the overall growth was partially offset by a decline
within the companys noncore wholesalertowholesaler pharmaceutical trading
business as further discussed below the increase in fiscal 2002 resulted from
a higher sales volume across various customer segments strong sales of
selfmanufactured products pharmaceutical price increases averaging
approximately 5 addition of new products and the addition of new customers
some of which was a result of new corporate agreements with health care
providers

         the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segments
operating revenue growth in fiscal 2003 resulted from strong sales to customers
within this segments core pharmaceutical distribution business some of which
were generated from the addition of new contracts the most significant growth
was in the alternate site and chain pharmacy businesses which yielded growth of
approximately 28 and 15 respectively the chain pharmacy growth rate would
have been stronger had it not experienced a reduction in business with kmart due
to kmarts closure of various stores in connection with kmarts bankruptcy the
overall growth rate in this segment was also negatively impacted by the lack of
availability of certain pharmaceutical products from manufacturers particularly
in the second half of the fiscal year which impacted noncore
wholesalertowholesaler revenue this lack of availability was in part
brought about by changes in inventory supply chain management policies of
certain vendors leading to the use of inventory management agreements
inventory management agreements generally provide for the company to be
compensated on a negotiated basis to help manufacturers better match their
shipments to meet market demand thereby resulting in less surplus inventory for
the companys trading business it is not anticipated that fluctuations in
trading activity will have a significant impact on operating revenue growth
rates in future years the increase in this segments operating revenue in
fiscal 2002 resulted from strong sales to all customer segments especially
retail pharmacy and grocery chains and alternate site customers each of which
yielded 20 growth as well as strong growth in mail order and government
customers a portion of the fiscal 2002 growth was attributable to
pharmaceutical price increases and the addition of new contracts

         the medical products and services segments operating revenue growth in
fiscal 2003 resulted from increased sales of both distributed and
selfmanufactured products the addition of several new contracts with hospitals
and health care networks as well as increased market share in the growing
surgery center market contributed to increased sales of distributed and
selfmanufactured products increased demand for certain existing
selfmanufactured products including medical gloves medivacr suction
canisters procedure based delivery systemr kits and other minor procedure
trays accounted for a portion of this segments revenue growth the addition of
new selfmanufactured products also contributed to the overall revenue growth
in this segment some examples of these new selfmanufactured products include
the esteemr surgeon gloves and the tiburontm and astoundtm fabrics within
the convertersr business the increase in this segments operating revenue in
fiscal 2002 resulted from strong sales of selfmanufactured products
particularly sales of surgical instruments and custom kits for surgical
procedures as well as price increases and increases in sales of distributed
products several new longterm contracts were signed within the segments
distribution business in fiscal 2002

         the pharmaceutical technologies and services segments operating
revenue growth in fiscal 2003 resulted from increased demand within the oral
technologies biotechnology and sterile life sciences and packaging services
businesses and from acquisitions primarily syncor product sales that showed
particular strength within these businesses included lillys zyprexar
zydisr an antipsychotic mylans amnesteemtm a generic drug for the
treatment of acne and sepracors xoponexr a respiratory drug the growth
within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business was negatively
impacted by the planned shutdown for twelve weeks of a domestic sterile
manufacturing facility to expand capacity the acquisition of syncor effective
january 1 2003 contributed to the growth in this segment excluding syncor
this segment experienced revenue growth in the high teens during fiscal 2003
the increase in this segments operating revenue in fiscal 2002 resulted from
higher sales volume particularly involving development and analytical services
pharmaceutical technologies and its proprietary packaging offerings products
that showed particular strength were abbotts kaletrar an aids product
lillys zyprexar zydisr and pharmacias detrolr la an incontinence
medication accelerating demand for sterileliquid and controlledrelease
technologies in addition to the acquisition of sp pharmaceuticals was a
significant contributor to the growth in fiscal 2002 within the pharmaceutical
technologies business the completion of the magellan acquisition during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 contributed to the growth in the analytical
services business excluding the revenues of sp pharmaceuticals and magellan
operating revenues grew approximately 6 in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001
additionally the segment experienced growth in fiscal 2002 in its
pharmaceutical packaging business which was attributable to the addition of
several new customers and increased volume from existing customers slowing
sales in the protease inhibitor and health and nutritional product lines
partially offset the growth in this segment during fiscal 2002

         the automation and information services segments operating revenue
growth in fiscal 2003 resulted from strong sales of new and existing patient
safety and supply management product lines including pyxis medstationr pyxis
anesthesia systemtm pyxis connecttm and pyxis supplystationr the
increase in this segments operating revenue in fiscal 2002 primarily resulted
from strong sales in the patient safety and supply management product lines
such as pyxis medstationr sn and pyxis supplystation 30

significant sales of new products including pyxis anesthesia system and products
within the pyxis supplystation line also contributed to this segments growth

bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other

         the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment reports
bulk deliveries made to customers warehouses as revenue these sales involve
the company acting as an intermediary in the ordering and subsequent delivery of
pharmaceutical products fluctuations in bulk deliveries result largely from
circumstances that the company cannot control including consolidation within
the customers industries decisions by customers to either begin or discontinue
warehousing activities and changes in policies by manufacturers related to
selling directly to customers due to the lack of margin generated through bulk
deliveries fluctuations in their amount have no significant impact on the
companys net earnings

         the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment records
outofpocket reimbursements received through its sales and marketing services
business as revenue these outofpocket expenses which generally include
travel expenses and other incidental costs are incurred to fulfill the services
required by the contract within these contracts the customer agrees to
reimburse the company for the expenses due to the company not generating any
margin from these reimbursements fluctuations in their amount have no impact on
the companys net earnings

         the overall gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue decreased
in fiscal 2003 and 2002 due to the mix of businesses contributing to the
consolidated gross margin the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of
operating revenue within the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services
segment in fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from the following 1 an increase in
sales to lowermargin customers which have a lower cost of distribution that
reduced gross margins 2 competitive pricing and 3 a moderation in vendor
margins due to manufacturers attempting to better match their shipments to meet
market demand resulting in less surplus inventory see additional discussion of
these factors below a decrease in gross margin as a percentage of operating
revenue within pharmaceutical technologies and services also contributed to the
overall decrease the decrease in the overall gross margin as a percentage of
operating revenue in fiscal 2002 resulted from a greater mix of lower margin
pharmaceutical distribution operating revenues as compared to the prior year
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment represented 82 of
operating revenues in fiscal 2002 up from 81 in fiscal 2001 the decline in
the gross margins in the medical products and services and automation and
information services segments also contributed to the overall decline in the
companys gross margin in fiscal 2002

         the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment decreased in fiscal
2003 this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue
primarily resulted from an increase in sales to lowermargin customers which
include chain pharmacy and alternate site which have a lower cost of
distribution the table below shows the percentage breakdown of operating
revenue by customer class within pharmaceutical distribution the largest

this segments selling margins were negatively impacted by competitive pricing
which was another primary cause of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage
of operating revenue a moderation in vendor margin programs also contributed to
the decline in this segments gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue
the company has seen changes in vendor supply chain

management policies related to product availability including the use of
inventory management agreements under these types of agreements the company is
generally compensated on a negotiated basis to help manufacturers better match
their shipments with market demand therefore adversely affecting the companys
investment margin opportunities generally the company is compensated under its
inventory management agreements based on the timing of inventory price increases
and the volume of inventory purchases during the agreed upon period the company
recognizes the amounts received from such agreements within gross margin based
upon related inventory sales

         the gross margins in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider
services segment may be affected in future years by changes occurring in the
industry such as changes in vendor supply chain management policies including
the use of inventory management agreements these changes provide fewer
opportunities for the pharmaceutical distribution business within the
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment to make large
purchases of product with related vendor margin incentives with fewer
opportunities to make attractive inventory investments the company expects to
deploy less capital in this segment

         the decline in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment in fiscal 2002
resulted primarily from the highly competitive market within the pharmaceutical
distribution industry and a greater mix of high volume customers where a lower
cost of distribution and better asset management enabled the company to offer
lower selling margins to its customers see table above in addition this
segments gross margin in fiscal 2002 was negatively impacted by several
nonrecurring items primarily related to the bindley integration in fiscal
2002 the company incurred a onetime inventory adjustment related to the
process of closing and rationalizing facilities in addition to the integration
of the operations of bindley into this segment these decreases in fiscal 2002
were partially offset by higher vendor margins from favorable price increases
and manufacturer marketing programs

         the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the medical
products and services segment remained unchanged in fiscal 2003 this segments
gross margin was positively impacted by increased sales of existing and new
highermargin selfmanufactured products manufacturing efficiencies achieved
during the fiscal year and outsourcing of some product manufacturing to more
cost efficient areas the impact of new distribution agreements which increased
sales of lowermargin distributed products offset the gains noted above the
decline in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in this segment in
fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from competitive pricing pressures on distributed
products this decline was partially offset by manufacturing productivity
improvements and a higher sales volume of selfmanufactured products which carry
significantly higher gross margins than other portions of this segments
business

         the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the
pharmaceutical technologies and services segment decreased during fiscal 2003
this decrease was primarily driven by the addition of syncors nuclear pharmacy
services business syncor has a slightly lower gross margin ratio than the other
businesses within this segment also the gross margin was negatively impacted
by certain items that occurred in fiscal 2002 that did not recur in fiscal 2003
including the recording of pricing adjustments related to the minimum recovery
expected to be received for claims against vitamin manufacturers for amounts
overcharged in prior years also see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial
statements these pricing adjustments were recorded as a reduction of cost of
goods sold consistent with the classification of the original overcharge and
were based on the minimum amounts estimated to be recoverable based on the facts
and circumstances available at the time they were recorded the company recorded
120 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and 100 million in the
second quarter of fiscal 2001 for these pricing adjustments this segments
gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue increased during fiscal 2002
this increase was primarily due to a larger mix of higher margin pharmaceutical
products versus health and nutritional products as well as cost efficiencies
due to infrastructure investments at manufacturing facilities this increase was
partially offset by the impact of certain items that occurred in fiscal 2001
which did not recur in fiscal 2002 namely revenues related to the use of
certain of the companys proprietary technology

         the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the automation
and information services segment increased in fiscal 2003 primarily from the
mix of products sold as well as productivity gains realized from the operational
improvements implemented in the prior fiscal year this segments gross margin
as a percentage of operating revenue decreased in fiscal 2002 primarily due to
changes in its product mix

1 in fiscal 2001 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage
    of operating revenue include goodwill amortization

         selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
operating revenue declined in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 this decline reflects
ongoing productivity programs and economies of scale associated with the
companys revenue growth significant productivity gains resulting from
continued cost control efforts in all segments and the continuation of
consolidation and selective automation of operating facilities contributed to
the improvement in addition the company is continuing to take advantage of
synergies from recent acquisitions to decrease selling general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue the improvement in
fiscal 2003 was partially offset by an increase in selling general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue in the
pharmaceutical technologies and services segment primarily the result of
changes within the business mix in this segment this business mix change was
largely driven by the acquisition of syncor which has a higher expense ratio as
compared to other businesses in this segment in the first quarter of fiscal
2002 the company ceased amortizing goodwill due to the adoption of statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets see notes 1 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements for
further discussion which also contributed to the improvement goodwill
amortization expense in fiscal 2001 was approximately 489 million in
addition during fiscal 2002 the company realized productivity and operating
efficiencies as a result of implementing changes within the automation and
information services segment to better service its customers

         the selling general and administrative expenses grew 7 and 6 in
fiscal years 2003 and 2002 respectively expenses from the operations of newly
acquired companies accounted for approximately 6 of the overall increase in
fiscal 2003 with expenses relating to the operations of syncor giving rise to
the largest part of the increase the increase in fiscal 2002 was primarily due
to an increase in personnel costs which accounted for approximately 4 of the
overall increase the overall increase in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 compares
favorably to the 14 and 15 growth in operating revenue for the same periods

         certain merger and acquisition related and restructuring costs are
based upon estimates actual amounts paid may ultimately differ from these
estimates if additional costs are incurred or recorded amounts exceed costs
such changes in estimates will be recorded in special items when incurred

         the company estimates that it will incur additional costs associated
with the various merger acquisition and restructuring activities entered into
to date totaling approximately 90 million approximately 60 million net of
tax in future periods this estimate is subject to adjustment pending
resolution of syncor acquisition related litigation contingencies additional
discussion related to the companys merger transactions is included in note 2 of
notes to consolidated financial statements the company believes that it will
incur these costs in order to properly integrate and rationalize operations a
portion of which represents facility rationalizations and implementing
efficiencies with regard to among other things information systems customer
systems marketing programs and administrative functions such amounts will be
charged to expense when incurred

         the companys trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its
role as a provider of services to the health care industry this trend has
resulted in expansion into service areas which a complement the companys
existing operations and b provide opportunities for the company to develop
synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired business as the health care
industry continues to change the company continually evaluates possible
candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to continue to seek
opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care
industry through all its reporting segments there can be no assurance that it
will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such
transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or
consummated the company would incur additional merger

                                       27
page

and acquisition related costs and there can be no assurance that the
integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful

interest expense and other the decrease in interest expense and other of 172
million during fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 resulted from lower interest
rates and effective asset management resulting in lower average borrowings
outstanding the decrease in interest expense and other of 224 million during
fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was a result of lower interest rates on
borrowings throughout the year and effective asset management resulting in
lower average borrowings outstanding in addition in fiscal 2002 the company
recognized a onetime gain on an equity investment which contributed to the
overall decline the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates
using various hedging strategies see notes 1 and 5 in notes to consolidated
financial statements

provision for income taxes the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings
before income taxes discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in
accounting were 336 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared with 338 in
fiscal 2002 and 356 for fiscal 2001 the fluctuation in the tax rate is
primarily due to changes within state and foreign effective tax rates resulting
from the companys business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items
which may have unique tax implications in addition effective july 1 2001 the
company ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
this contributed to the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001

critical accounting policies

         critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can
have a significant impact on the presentation of the companys financial
condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and
subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ
from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the
companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent
on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting
policies see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements

        allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily
         comprised of amounts owed to the company through its operating
         activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts
         the company also provides financing to various customers such
         financing arrangements range from one year to ten years at interest
         rates that generally fluctuate with the prime rate the financings may
         be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance
         notes and accrued interest receivable are recorded net of an allowance
         for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets extending
         credit terms and calculating the required allowance involve the use of
         a substantial amount of judgment by the companys management in
         determining the appropriate allowance the company reviews the industry
         trends and the customers financial strength credit standing and
         payment history to assess the probability of collection see schedule
         ii included in this form 10k which includes a rollforward of activity
         for these allowance reserves

        inventories a majority of inventories approximately 68 in 2003 and
         67 in 2002 are stated at the lower of cost using the lastin
         firstout lifo method or market and are primarily merchandise
         inventories the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower
         of cost using the firstin firstout fifo method or market if
         the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation which
         approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been
         higher below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory

        goodwill the company elected to adopt sfas no 142 goodwill and other
         intangible assets beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2002
         under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with
         indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead tested for
         impairment at least annually accordingly the company ceased
         amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
         lives as of july 1 2001 intangible assets with finite lives
         primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue
         to be amortized over their useful lives the company completed the
         required impairment testing in fiscal 2003 and 2002 and did not incur
         any impairment charges

        special charges the company primarily records costs that relate to the
         integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring
         operations to improve productivity as special charges integration
         costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests
         method have been recorded in accordance with eitf 943 liability
         recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs
         to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a
         restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 100 restructuring
         and impairment charges certain costs related to these acquisitions
         such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs
         were recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by
         management certain other integration costs that did not meet the
         criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the
         integration plan has been implemented

                  the costs associated with integrating acquired companies under
         the purchase method are recorded in accordance with eitf 953
         recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business
         combination certain costs to be incurred by the company as the
         acquirer such as employee and lease terminations and other facility
         exit costs are recognized at the date the integration plan is
         formalized and adopted by management certain other integration costs
         that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are
         expensed as the integration plan is implemented

                  at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2003 the
         company implemented sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with
         exit or disposal activities to account for costs incurred in
         restructuring activities under this standard a liability for an exit
         cost is recognized as incurred as discussed above the company
         previously accounted for costs associated with restructuring activities
         under eitf 943 liability recognition for certain employee
         termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including
         certain costs incurred in a restructuring which required the company
         to recognize a liability for restructuring costs on the date of the
         commitment to an exit plan

                  the majority of the special items incurred can be classified
         in one of the following categories employeerelated costs exit costs
         including lease termination costs asset impairments and other
         integration costs employee costs include severance and termination
         benefits lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees

liquidity and capital resources

         working capital increased to 59 billion at june 30 2003 from 51
billion at june 30 2002 this increase in working capital primarily resulted
from increases in trade receivables and inventories of 4890 million and 2623
million respectively the increase in trade receivables was driven by the
companys revenue growth as well as the addition of syncor the increase in
inventories resulted primarily from increased sales across each of the companys
segments the increase in inventories noted above is less than in prior years
due to the impact of branded to generic product conversions vendor inventory
policies and the use of inventory management agreements which lowered the
companys inventory investment synergies realized from the bindley integration
have also lowered the companys investment in inventory

         net investment in salestype leases decreased 1078 million at june

acquisition totaling approximately 7808 million the valuation of syncor
vested options acquired of 472 million and the investment of 2659 million by
employees of the company through various stock incentive plans this increase in
fiscal 2003 was partially offset by the repurchase of common shares of 11917
million and dividends paid of 448 million

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

foreign exchange rate sensitivity the company is exposed to cash flow and
earnings fluctuations due to exchange rate variation foreign currency risk
exists by nature of the companys global operations because the company
manufactures and sells its products throughout the world its foreign currency
risk is diversified for fiscal 2003 and 2002 the companys net transactional
exposure was approximately 2603 million and 2035 million respectively as
of june 30 2003 and 2002 a hypothetical 10 aggregate increase or decrease in
the currencies to which the company has exposure would result in a gain or

                                       33
page

loss of approximately 260 million and 204 million respectively principally
driven by exposures to the euro and the mexican peso in order to mitigate its
transactional exposure to foreign currency risk the company enters into hedging
contracts for fiscal 2003 and 2002 the company hedged approximately 54 and
40 respectively of its exposure to transactions denominated in different
foreign currencies in the event of a hypothetical 10 aggregate increase or
decrease in the currencies to which the company has exposure the resulting gain
or loss previously noted for fiscal 2003 and 2002 would decrease by
approximately 141 million and 81 million respectively therefore as a
result of the companys hedging activity as of june 30 2003 and 2002 a
hypothetical 10 aggregate increase or decrease in the currencies to which the
company has exposure would result in a net gain or loss of approximately 119
million and 123 million respectively 260 million less 141 million
mitigated by hedges in fiscal 2003 204 million less 81 million mitigated by
hedges in fiscal 2002 see notes 1 and 5 of notes to consolidated financial
statements for further discussion

         the company also has exposure related to the translation of financial
statements from the local currency of its foreign divisions back to us
dollars the functional and reporting currency of the parent company during
fiscal 2003 and 2002 this translational exposure totaled approximately 1088
million and 672 million respectively the potential gain or loss due to
foreign currency translation assuming a 10 aggregate increase or decrease in
the respective currencies would be approximately 109 million and 67
million respectively for fiscal 2003 and 2002 the company typically does not
hedge any of its translational exposure there were no translational hedges
outstanding at june 30 2003 and 2002

interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to changes in interest rates
primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain
liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of the companys
longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of
business requirements market conditions and other factors the company utilizes
interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate
movements

         as of june 30 2003 and 2002 the potential gain or loss due to a
hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would be approximately 13 million
and 23 million respectively see notes 1 and 5 of notes to consolidated
financial statements for further discussion

commodity price sensitivity the company purchases certain commodities for use
in its manufacturing processes which include rubber heating oil diesel fuel
and polystyrene the company typically purchases these commodities at market
prices and as such is affected by fluctuations in the market prices for
fiscal 2003 and 2002 the total commodity exposure was approximately 333
million and 320 million respectively the impact of a hypothetical 10
fluctuation in commodity prices would be approximately 33 million and 32
million respectively for fiscal 2003 and 2002



item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
        financial disclosure

         the information called for by this item 9 is incorporated herein by
reference to the companys definitive proxy statement to be filed with the sec
pursuant to regulation 14a of the exchange act relating to the companys annual
meeting under the caption selection of independent auditors



item 9a controls and procedures

         the company carried out an evaluation as required by exchange act rule
13a15b under the supervision and with the participation of the companys
management including the companys chief executive officer and executive vice
president and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief
executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer
concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the
companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
them to material information relating to the company including its consolidated
subsidiaries required to be included in the companys periodic sec filings

         the companys management including the companys chief executive
officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer does not
expect that the companys disclosure controls and procedures and its internal
controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how
well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two
or more people or by management override of the control the design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected the
company monitors its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls
and makes modifications as necessary the companys intent in this regard is
that the disclosure controls and procedures and the internal controls will be
maintained as dynamic systems that change including with improvements and
corrections as conditions warrant

         during the last quarter of the companys fiscal year ended june 30
2003 there have been no changes to our internal controls over financial
reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal controls over financial reporting

customers and suppliers

     the companys largest retail distribution customer in its pharmaceutical
distribution and provider services segment cvs meridian inc cvs
accounted for approximately 13 of the companys operating revenues by dollar
volume for fiscal year 2002 this segment could be adversely affected if the
business of this customer were lost the two largest retail bulk distribution
customers in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment are
cvs and walgreens co walgreens accounting for approximately 60 and 20
respectively of all bulk deliveries due to the lack of margin generated
through bulk deliveries fluctuations in their purchases would have no
significant impact on the segments earnings novation llc novation and
premier purchasing partners lp premier are the two largest group
purchasing organizations each a gpo having business arrangements with the
company that account for approximately 11 and 9 respectively of the
companys operating revenues by dollar volume in fiscal 2002 through the
companys pharmaceutical distribution and provider services and medicalsurgical
products and services segments each of these two segments could be adversely
affected if the business arrangements with either gpo customer were lost
although the loss of the business arrangement with either gpo would not mean the
loss of sales from all members of the gpo

     the company obtains its products from many different suppliers the largest
of which pfizer inc accounted for approximately 8 by dollar volume of the
companys total revenue in fiscal 2002 the companys five largest suppliers
combined accounted for approximately 31 by dollar volume of the companys
total revenue during fiscal 2002 and the companys relationships with its
suppliers are generally very good the companys arrangements with its
pharmaceutical suppliers typically may be canceled by either the company or the
supplier upon 30 to 90 days prior notice although many of these arrangements
are not governed by formal agreements the loss of certain suppliers could
adversely affect the companys business if alternative sources of supply were
unavailable

     cardinal distribution generates operating margin in many ways from its
vendors including inventory investment buying opportunities rebates vendor
program arrangements agreements and offerings in the future vendors may not
continue to offer such programs in the same form or at the current levels

     while certain of the companys operations may show quarterly fluctuations
the company does not consider its business to be seasonal in nature on a
consolidated basis

competition

     the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive in the
pharmaceutical wholesale distribution business the company competes directly
with numerous other national and regional wholesale distributors direct selling
manufacturers selfwarehousing chains and specialty distributors on the basis
of a value proposition that includes breadth of product lines marketing
programs support services and pricing the companys pharmaceutical wholesale
distribution operations have narrow profit margins and accordingly the
companys earnings depend significantly on its ability to distribute a large
volume and variety of products efficiently and to provide quality support
services with respect to pharmacy franchising operations several smaller
franchisors compete with medicine shoppe in the franchising of pharmacies with
competition being based primarily upon benefits offered to both the pharmacist
and the customer access to third party programs the reputation of the
franchise and pricing medicine shoppe also needs to be competitive with a
pharmacists ongoing option to remain selfemployed at his or her current
position rather than becoming a franchisee through central pharmacy the
company competes with other nuclear pharmacy service companies and distributors
engaged in the preparation and delivery of radiopharmaceuticals for use in
nuclear imaging procedures in hospitals and clinics such competitors include
national and regional operators of radiopharmacies numerous independent
radiopharmacies and manufacturers and universities that have established their
own radiopharmacies with its chpps subsidiary the company competes with both
national and regional hospital pharmacy management firms and selfmanaged
hospitals and hospital systems on the basis of services offered its established
base of business the effective use of information systems the development of
clinical programs the quality of the services it provides to its customers and
price the companys allegiance subsidiary faces substantial competition in all
of its product and service markets with competition focusing primarily on
product performance service levels and price

     in the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment the company
competes on several fronts the oral technologies group competes with a
growing number of new drug delivery technologies and continued refinement to
existing delivery technologies the sterile technologies group competes with
other companies that provide sterile manufacturing in glass or plastic liquid
or lyophilization the pharmaceutical development group competes with other
companies that provide contract laboratory services analytical and development
for specialty delivery techniques the packaging services group competes with
companies that provide packaging services and clinical and analytical packaging
services and the sales and marketing group competes with other companies as
well as pharmaceutical companies that provide medical education
marketingproduct launch services and contract sales services all of the
foregoing groups compete on quality responsiveness proprietary offerings
customer service and price

     as a marketer of automated pharmaceutical dispensing and supply systems
through pyxis the company competes based upon quality its installed base of
systems relationships with customers customer service and support
capabilities patents and other intellectual property its ability to interface
with customer information systems and price actual and potential competitors to

pharmaceutical dispensing systems automated medication management systems
medication packaging medical devices processes products formulations drug
delivery systems and sterile manufacturing the company has a number of pending
patent applications in the united states and certain foreign countries and
intends to pursue additional patents as appropriate although the company
believes that its patents do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third
parties from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims
against the company and it is possible that third parties will assert
infringement claims against the company in the future in addition it may
become necessary for the company to pursue litigation to protect trade secrets
and other proprietary rights to enforce patent copyright and trademark rights
and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others

     the company also owns certain software including software used for
pharmaceutical purchasing and inventory control which is copyrighted and

risk factors that may affect future results

changing united states healthcare environment may adversely affect the companys
operating results in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone
significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs these efforts
include but are not limited to potential national healthcare reform trends
toward managed care cuts in medicare consolidation of competitors suppliers
and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups
this industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the
foreseeable future other factors related to the healthcare industry that could
negatively impact the companys results of operations include but are not
limited to

        changes in governmental support of and reimbursement for healthcare
         services

        changes in the method by which healthcare services are delivered

        changes in the prices for healthcare services

        other legislation or regulations governing healthcare services or
         mandated benefits and

        changes in pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical manufacturers pricing
         or distribution policies

additional regulatory risks may adversely affect the companys operating
results the healthcare industry is highly regulated consequently the company
is subject to the risk of changes in various local state federal and foreign
laws which include the operating and security standards of the united states
drug enforcement administration the fda various state boards of pharmacy and
comparable agencies if changes were to occur they could affect many of the
companys regulated operations which include distributing prescription
pharmaceuticals including certain controlled substances operating pharmacy
operations including nuclear pharmacies manufacturing medicalsurgical
products manufacturing pharmaceuticals using proprietary drug delivery systems
and packaging pharmaceuticals also the healthcare regulatory environment may
change in a manner that could restrict the companys existing operations limit
the expansion of the companys business or otherwise affect the company
adversely

risks generally associated with the companys acquisition strategy and internal
growth may adversely affect the companys operating results an important
element of the companys growth strategy has been and is expected to continue to
be the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which either expand or
complement the companys existing businesses over the past several years the
company has expanded beyond its core pharmaceutical distribution business into
areas such as medicalsurgical manufacturing and distribution and drug delivery
systems integrating businesses however involves a number of special risks
including the possibility that management may be distracted from regular
business concerns by the need to integrate operations unforeseen difficulties
in integrating operations and systems problems assimilating and retaining the
employees of the company or the acquired company accounting issues that could
arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired
company challenges in retaining customers of the acquired company or of the
company following the acquisition and potential adverse short term effects on
operating results through increased costs or otherwise while the company has
not experienced any material integration problems in recent years the
possibility of integration issues increases when the company ventures outside
its normal core businesses in addition the company may incur debt to finance
future acquisitions andor may issue securities in connection with future
acquisitions which may dilute the holdings of current and future shareholders of
the company in addition to the risks associated with acquisition related
growth the companys business has grown in size and complexity over the past
few years as a result of internal growth this has placed significant demands on
the companys management systems internal controls and financial and physical
resources to meet such demands the company intends to continue to hire new
employees invest in new technology and make other capital expenditures if the
company is unable to successfully and timely complete and integrate strategic
acquisitions or fails to efficiently manage operations in a way that
accommodates continued internal growth the companys business financial
conditions and results of operations could be adversely impacted

in the range of damages sought and based on the multiple number of defendants in
these lawsuits allegiance cannot reasonably quantify the total amount of
possibleprobable damages therefore allegiance and the company do not believe
that these numbers should be considered as an indication of either reasonably
possible or probable liability

     since the inception of this litigation baxterallegiance have been named
as a defendant in approximately eight hundred cases as of june 30 2002 fewer
than half of those lawsuits remain pending nearly half of the lawsuits that
have been resolved were concluded without any liability to baxterallegiance
during the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 allegiance began settling some of
these lawsuits with greater frequency no individual claim has been settled for
a material amount nor have all the settled claims in the aggregate comprised
a material amount due to the number of claims filed and the ongoing defense
costs that will be incurred allegiance believes it is probable that it will
incur substantial legal fees related to the resolution of the cases still
pending although the company continues to believe that it cannot reasonably
estimate the potential cost to settle these lawsuits the company believes that
the impact of such lawsuits upon allegiance will be immaterial to the companys
financial position liquidity and results of operations and could be in the
range of 0 to 20 million net of insurance proceeds with the top end of the
range reflecting virtually no insurance coverage which the company believes is
an unlikely scenario given the insurance coverage in place the company
believes a substantial portion of any liability will be covered by insurance
policies allegiance has with financially viable insurance companies subject to
selfinsurance retentions exclusions conditions coverage gaps policy limits
and insurer solvency the company and allegiance continue to believe that
insurance recovery is probable

epa named allegiance as a potentially responsible party prp for the
groundwater contamination in the bpou along with a number of other prps in
june 2000 the us epa issued a unilateral administrative order uao against
a number of companies including allegiance the uao requires among other
things the design and implementation of the interim groundwater remedy selected
by us epa this interim remedy generally requires pumping contaminated
groundwater from the aquifer and treating it in accordance with federal and
state government standards in order to remove or reduce contaminants of concern
and to stop the further migration of contaminants allegiance has maintained
that the irwindale property did not contribute to the alleged ground water
contamination the levels of contaminants detected on the irwindale property are
well below any state or federal standard requiring remediation or monitoring
the us epa is engaged in settlement discussions with allegiance and has not
sued allegiance in connection with the uao or the bpou previously the us epa
made a cash buyout demand to allegiance of 600000 allegiance responded with
questions as to the calculations and data utilized by the us epa to reach the
600000 amount by using the us epas own equation and allegiances
reasonable understanding of the facts allegiance reasonably believes that its
potential liability would be less than the cash buy out demand amount
allegiance has recorded environmental accruals based upon the information
available that it reasonably believes are adequate to satisfy known costs the
company reasonably believes that the impact of this claim upon allegiance will
be immaterial to the companys financial position liquidity and results of
operation

fiscal 2001 this increase is a result of a higher sales volume across various

volume to existing customers pharmaceutical price increases averaging
approximately 4 acquisitions and addition of new customers some of which was
a result of crossselling opportunities among the various businesses for
further discussion of acquisitions see note 2 of notes to consolidated
financial statements

include bbmc revenues prior to acquisition excluding bbmc revenues in 2001 the
total operating revenues grew approximately 4 over fiscal 2000

     the pharmaceutical technologies and services segments operating revenue

antipsychotic and pharmacias detrolr la an incontinence medication
accelerating demand for sterileliquid and controlledrelease technologies in
addition to the acquisition of sp pharmaceuticals was a significant contributor
to the growth within the pharmaceutical technologies business the completion of
the magellan acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 contributed to
the growth in the analytical services business excluding the revenues of sp
pharmaceuticals and magellan operating revenues grew approximately 6 over
fiscal 2001 additionally the segment experienced growth in its pharmaceutical
packaging business which was attributable to the addition of several new
customers and increased volume from existing customers the increase in this

system 30 significant sales of new products including anesthesia system and
products within the supplystation line also contributed to this segments
growth the increase in this segments operating revenue in fiscal 2001

existing automation products

bulk deliveries to customer warehouses the company reports bulk deliveries made
to customers warehouses as revenue these sales involve the company acting as
an intermediary in the ordering and subsequent delivery of pharmaceutical
products fluctuations in bulk deliveries result largely from circumstances that
the company cannot control including consolidation within the customers
industries decisions by customers to either begin or discontinue warehousing
activities changes in policies by manufacturers related to selling directly to
customers and the addition or loss of customers due to the lack of margin
generated through bulk deliveries fluctuations in their amount have no

     the overall gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue decreased in
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 this decrease resulted from a greater mix of lower
margin pharmaceutical distribution operating revenues in fiscal 2002 and fiscal
2001 as compared to the prior years the pharmaceutical distribution and
provider services segment represented 82 of operating revenues in fiscal 2002
up from 81 and 79 of operating revenues in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000
respectively the decline in the margins in the medicalsurgical products and
services and automation and information services segments also contributed to
the overall decline in the companys gross margin

     the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the pharmaceutical
distribution and provider services segment decreased in fiscal 2002 this
decrease was primarily due to the highly competitive market within the
pharmaceutical distribution industry and a greater mix of high volume customers
where a lower cost of distribution and better asset management enabled the
company to offer lower selling margins to its customers in addition this
segments gross margin was negatively impacted by several nonrecurring items
primarily related to the bindley integration the company incurred a onetime
inventory adjustment related to the process of closing and rationalizing
facilities in addition to the integration of the operations of bindley and
cardinal these decreases were partially offset by higher vendor margins from
favorable price increases and manufacturer marketing programs gross margin as a
percentage of operating revenue declined in fiscal 2001 primarily due to the
impact of lower selling

margins the decline in selling margins was attributed to a highly competitive
market and greater mix of high volume customers where a lower cost of
distribution and better asset management enabled the company to offer lower
selling margins to its customers this decrease was partially offset by higher
vendor margins from favorable price increases and manufacturer marketing
programs

     the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the
medicalsurgical products and services segment decreased in fiscal 2002
primarily due to competitive pricing pressures on distributed products this
decline was partially offset by manufacturing productivity improvements and a
higher sales volume of selfmanufactured products which carry significantly
higher gross margins than other portions of this segments business in fiscal
2001 the decline in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue was
primarily due to the acquisition of bbmc this acquisition shifted product mix
toward lower margin distributed products

     the pharmaceutical technologies and services segments gross margin as a
percentage of operating revenue increased during fiscal 2002 this increase was
primarily due to a larger mix of higher margin pharmaceutical products versus
health and nutritional products as well as cost efficiencies due to recent
infrastructure investments at manufacturing facilities this increase was
partially offset by the impact of certain items that occurred in fiscal 2001
which did not recur in fiscal 2002 namely revenues related to the use of
certain of the companys proprietary technology this segments gross margin as
a percentage of operating revenue increased in fiscal 2001 versus fiscal 2000
due to an increase in sales volume in the higher margin liquid fill contract
manufacturing and drug delivery system businesses the drug delivery system
business shift to higher margin pharmaceutical products from lower margin
health and nutrition products also contributed to the improvement in gross
margin in addition during both fiscal 2002 and 2001 the company recognized
pricing adjustments related to the minimum recovery expected to be received for
claims against vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years see
note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements these pricing
adjustments were recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold consistent with
the classification of the original overcharge and were based on the minimum
amounts estimated to be recoverable based on the facts and circumstances
available at the time they were recorded the amounts recorded for these pricing
adjustments were 120 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and 100
million in the second quarter of fiscal 2001

     the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the automation and
information services segment decreased in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 primarily
due to changes in its product mix as a result of increased sales of
supplystation which generates a lower gross margin than the medication line of
products due to the relatively less complex nature of the product

     1  in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 selling general and administrative
          expenses as a percentage of operating revenue include goodwill
          amortization

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating
revenue declined in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 this decline reflects economies
of scale associated with the companys revenue growth significant productivity
gains resulting from continued cost control efforts in all segments and the
continuation of consolidation and selective automation of operating facilities
contributed to the improvement in addition the company is continuing to take
advantage of synergies from recent acquisitions to decrease selling general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue in fiscal 2002
the company ceased amortizing goodwill due to the adoption of statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets see notes 1 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements for
further discussion which also contributed to the improvement goodwill
amortization expense in fiscal 2001 was approximately 489 million in
addition the company realized productivity and operating efficiencies as a
result of implementing changes at pyxis to better service its customers
partially offsetting the improvement in selling general and administrative
expenses in fiscal 2001 was an increase in these expenses as a percentage of
operating revenue for the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment this
change was primarily a result of surplus capacity in the health and nutritional
manufacturing facilities for this segment

     the selling general and administrative expenses excluding goodwill
amortization grew 6 and 14 in fiscal years 2002 and 2001 respectively the
increase in fiscal 2002 and 2001 is attributed primarily to an increase in
personnel costs which accounted

for approximately 4 and 12 respectively of the overall increase the overall
increase compares favorably to the 15 and 28 growth in operating revenue for
the same periods

     certain mergerrelated and restructuring costs are based upon estimates
actual amounts paid may ultimately differ from these estimates if additional
costs are incurred or recorded amounts exceed costs such changes in estimates
will be recorded in special charges when incurred

     the company estimates that it will incur additional mergerrelated costs
associated with the various merger transactions completed to date totaling
approximately 759 million 489 million net of tax in future periods
additional discussion related to the companys merger transactions is included
in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company believes
that it will incur these costs in order to properly integrate operations  a
portion of which represents facility rationalizations and implementing
efficiencies with regard to among other things information systems customer
systems marketing programs and administrative functions such amounts will be
charged to expense when incurred

      the companys trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its
role as a provider of services to the healthcare industry this trend has
resulted in expansion into service areas which a complement the companys
existing operations and b provide opportunities for the company to develop
synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired business as the healthcare
industry continues to change the company continually evaluates possible
candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to continue to seek
opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the healthcare
industry through all its reporting segments there can be no assurance that it
will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such
transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or
consummated the company would incur additional mergerrelated costs

interest expense and other the decrease in interest expense and other of 224
million during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was a result of lower
interest rates on borrowings throughout the year and effective asset management
in addition the company recognized a onetime gain on an equity investment
contributing to the overall decline the increase in interest expense and other
of 162 million during fiscal 2001 was a result of higher average levels of
borrowing during fiscal 2001

provision for income taxes the provisions for income taxes relative to pretax
earnings were 338 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared with 356 in
fiscal 2001 and 371 for fiscal 2000 the fluctuation in the tax rate is
primarily due to the impact of recording certain nondeductible mergerrelated
costs during various periods as well as fluctuating state and foreign effective
tax rates as a result of the companys business mix for all three fiscal years
in addition effective july 1 2001 the company ceased amortizing goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives this contributed to the decrease in the
tax rate in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 the
provisions for income taxes excluding the impact of mergerrelated charges and
of goodwill were 341 344 and 355 for the fiscal years 2002 2001 and
2000 respectively

critical accounting policies

     critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a
significant impact on the presentation of the companys financial condition and
results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective
estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment because of the
uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these
estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the companys financial
statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of
estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of
notes to consolidated financial statements

    allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised
     of amounts owed to the company through its pharmaceutical and other
     healthcare distribution activities and are presented net of an allowance of
     doubtful accounts the company also provides financing to various
     customers such financing arrangements range from one year to ten years at
     interest rates that generally fluctuate with the prime rate the financings
     may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance
     notes and accrued interest receivable are recorded net of an allowance for
     doubtful accounts and are included in other assets extending credit terms
     and calculating the required allowance involve the use of a substantial
     amount of judgment by the companys management in determining the
     appropriate allowance the company reviews the industry trends and the
     customers financial strength credit standing and payment history to
     assess the probability of collection

    inventories a majority of inventories approximately 67 in 2002 and 66
     in 2001 are stated at lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo
     method or market and are primarily merchandise inventories the remaining
     inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin
     firstout fifo method or market if the company had used the fifo
     method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost
     inventories would have been higher below is a reconciliation of fifo
     inventory to lifo inventory

    goodwill the company elected to adopt sfas no 142 goodwill and other
     intangible assets beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2002 under
     sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
     lives are no longer amortized but instead tested for impairment at least
     annually accordingly the company has ceased amortization of all goodwill
     and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of july 1 2001 intangible
     assets with finite lives primarily patents and trademarks will continue
     to be amortized over their useful lives

         sfas no 142 requires a twostep impairment test for goodwill the
     first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units assets
     to the fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the
     fair value then the second step is required to be completed which involves
     allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and
     liability with the excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss
     occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill
     the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and
     record any resulting impairment losses annually changes in market
     conditions among other factors may have an impact on these estimates the
     company completed the required impairment testing in fiscal 2002 and did
     not incur any impairment charges

    special charges the company primarily records costs that relate to the
     integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring
     operations to improve productivity as special charges these costs are
     recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force 943 liability
     recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to
     exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and
     staff accounting bulletin no 100 restructuring and impairment charges
     certain costs such as employee and lease terminations and other facility
     exit costs are recognized at the date the integration or restructuring
     plan is formalized and adopted by management certain other integration
     costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are
     expensed as the integration plan is implemented employee costs include
     severance and termination benefits lease termination costs include lease
     cancellation fees forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under
     existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income other facility

pharmaceutical distribution and provider services activities

various stock incentive plans this increase was offset by dividends paid of
450 million and by an increase in treasury stock of 3083 million primarily
due to the companys repurchase of shares see further discussion in note 10 of

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

foreign exchange rate sensitivity the company is exposed to cash flow and
earnings fluctuations due to exchange rate variation foreign currency risk
exists by nature of the companys global operations because the company
manufactures and sells its products throughout the world its foreign currency
risk is diversified for fiscal 2002 the companys net transactional exposure
was approximately 2035 million as of june 30 2002 a hypothetical 10
aggregate increase or decrease in the currencies to which the company has
exposure would result in a gain or loss of approximately 204 million
principally driven by exposures to the euro and the mexican peso in order to
mitigate its transactional exposure to foreign currency risk the company enters
into hedging instruments for fiscal 2002 the company hedged approximately 40
of its exposure to transactions denominated in different foreign currencies in
the event of a hypothetical 10 aggregate increase or decrease in the currencies
to which the company has exposure the resulting gain or loss previously noted
would decrease by approximately 81 million therefore as a result of the
companys hedging activity as of june 30 2002 a hypothetical 10 aggregate
increase or decrease in the currencies to which the company has exposure would
result in a net gain or loss of approximately 123 million 204 million less
81 million mitigated via hedges see notes 1 and 5 of notes to consolidated
financial statements for further discussion

     the company also has exposure related to the translation of financial
statements from the local currency of its foreign divisions back to us
dollars the functional and reporting currency of the parent company during
fiscal 2002 this translational exposure totaled approximately 672 million
the potential gain or loss due to foreign currency translation assuming a 10
aggregate increase or decrease in the respective currencies would be
approximately 67 million the company does not hedge any of its translational
exposure

interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to changes in interest rates
primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain
liquidity and fund business operations the nature and amount of the companys
longterm and shortterm debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of
business requirements market conditions and other factors the company
utilizes interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest
rate movements

in its manufacturing processes which include rubber heating oil diesel fuel
and polystyrene the company typically purchases these commodities at market
prices and as such is affected by fluctuations in the market prices for
